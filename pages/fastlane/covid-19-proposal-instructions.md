# COVID-19 Proposal Instructions

Read the full “Dear Colleague Letter: Request for SBIR/STTR Phase I Proposals Addressing COVID-19” 

Small businesses who are interested in submitting NSF SBIR or STTR Phase I proposals in response to this DCL must follow the guidelines outlined in the NSF SBIR and STTR Phase I solicitations (see here for details), including the submission of a required Project Pitch. Companies who already have an active SBIR/STTR award with NSF may submit a new Phase I proposal relevant to this DCL but must also submit a Project Pitch first.

When submitting a Project Pitch:

* Select “COVID-19” as the SBIR/STTR topic area on the Project Pitch form
* Reference the word “COVID-19” and this Dear Colleague Letter (NSF 20-XXX ) in the “Describe the Technology/Innovation” field.

Companies that receive an invitation to submit a proposal (based on an invited COVID-19 Project Pitch) should then submit their NSF SBIR/STTR Phase I proposals through Fastlane. Follow the NSF SBIR and STTR Phase I solicitation guidelines with the following additional guidance:

* The term “COVID-19” must be in the proposal title.
* Small businesses are encouraged to facilitate an expedited submission and review by submitting a nine-page project description (closer to the nine-page solicitation minimum - the maximum is fifteen pages).

As is the case for all NSF proposers, the proposing organization is required to have an active registration with the System for Award Management (at SAM.gov) to register in Research.gov and prepare a full proposal. SAM.gov registration is not needed to submit a Project Pitch but can take days or weeks to obtain. Interested small business should plan accordingly.
