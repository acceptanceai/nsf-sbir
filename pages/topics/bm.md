The Biomedical Technologies topic aims to support the early-stage development of novel products, processes, or services that will enable the delivery of high-quality, economically-efficient healthcare in the United States and globally. Subtopics under Biomedical Technologies include pharmaceutical manufacturing, materials for biomedical application, non-invasive technologies to better understand brain function, medical imaging technologies (covering both better imaging and imaging agents), diagnostic assays and platforms that deal with screening, diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring of diseases, and drug delivery platform. **The BM subtopics are not aimed at supporting or conducting clinical trials, clinical efficacy or safety studies, the development pre-clinical or clinical-stage drug candidates or medical devices, or work performed primarily for regulatory purposes.** Limited studies with human subjects may be acceptable to the extent that they are performed in support of feasibility, proof-of-concept studies of early-stage technologies. **Proposals that request support for clinical studies will be deemed non-compliant with the SBIR/STTR solicitations and may be returned without review.**
