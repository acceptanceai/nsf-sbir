The Biological Technologies topic covers a wide range of technology areas to advance engineering and science innovation across the biological spectrum. We are in a biotechnology revolution where advanced biological technologies have disrupted decades-old chemical, agricultural, and medical products and services producing a new bioeconomy. The bioeconomy is on course to make major socioeconomic contributions to the United States and world economies to boost productivity in industrial and agricultural processes, improve human health, and make advances toward environmental sustainability. We seek to support next-generation technologies that will continue to advance disruptive, high-impact, and high-payback innovation in the bioeconomy. Proposed projects should be focused on using or modifying living organisms, systems, or biological processes to develop novel technologies to produce biochemicals, medical products, and agricultural products. They may involve bioengineering to improve function in molecules, cells, and tissues in humans, plants, animals, and microbes. In addition, enabling technologies are encouraged, such as new tools for genomics, proteomics, and drug discovery, the development of instruments for biological applications, computational and bioinformatic tools, and new manufacturing technologies for cells, tissues, organs and biologics.
