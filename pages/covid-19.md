March XX, NSF posted a [new funding opportunity](https://www.nsf.gov) inviting US-based small businesses to submit Phase I proposals focused on the research, development and deployment of new technologies, products, processes, and services with the potential to positively impact the nation’s and world’s ability to respond to the COVID-19 crisis. 

Proposals will be reviewed according to the NSF Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)/Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) merit review criteria as outlined in the solicitations (Intellectual Merit, Broader Impacts, and Commercial Impact).

NSF is committed to expediting review with the hope of awards within six weeks of proposal receipt.
