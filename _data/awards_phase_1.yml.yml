- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase I project seeks to commercialize new sensor technologies
    that enable the rapid measurement of the handedness of molecular mixtures.   Like
    screws and keys, many molecules possess a certain handedness that can be important
    when interacting with living systems.  This issue is vital to pharmaceutical research,
    where one handed form of a drug may result in benefits while the opposite form
    may cause harmful side effects.  Consequently, measuring the handedness of molecular
    mixtures is of paramount importance in modern pharmaceutical research.  However,
    conventional approaches to making these measurements are often too slow for modern
    pharmaceutical discovery and development research where high-throughput experiments
    on hundreds or even thousands of samples per day are performed.  This project
    aims to remove this bottleneck by leveraging a recently introduced new instrument
    and commercializing reagent kits that have been shown in academic laboratories
    to achieve a much faster and simpler method for measuring the handedness of molecular
    mixtures.  Making this improved technology widely available to the greater research
    and development community has the potential to streamline drug development efforts
    at reduced cost and minimized waste production, which is expected to increase
    profit margins and create new jobs in research, development and manufacturing,
    resulting in substantial benefit to the health and economy of the United States.
    \ \n\nThe innovation of this project comprises a series of optical sensors, developed
    during a decade of fundamental research in the participating laboratories, which
    will allow rapid eescreening of a variety of asymmetric reactions. The focus of
    this unprecedented enterprise is to validate selected sensors against pharmaceutically
    relevant compounds, determine the error of the optical assays by comparison with
    traditional techniques such as chiral HPLC, to evaluate the robustness in the
    presence of potential interferants, and to apply a sensor in the analysis of an
    asymmetric reaction using multi-well plate technology. The development of a user-friendly
    kit will include the testing of different methods for the creation of pre-dispensed
    dried sensors that can be reconstituted without leaving behind residues that might
    increase the error margin beyond a few percent which is generally acceptable for
    high-throughput screening applications. The final outcome will be a convenient
    mix-and-measure protocol that enables rapid analysis of hundreds of small-scale
    asymmetric reaction mixtures.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
    has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual
    merit and broader impacts review criteria."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to demonstrate the feasibility of MedSwarm, a software product for radiology that will significantly improve patient outcomes and reduce medical costs. MedSwarm is an AI-based collaborative decision-making system that will significantly amplify diagnostic accuracy across a wide range diagnoses, not by replacing radiologists with AI, but by amplifying their human expertise. MedSwarm employs a technology called Artificial Swarm Intelligence that collects input from small groups of doctors and uses AI to optimize their combined accuracy. This hybrid human-AI system will achieve diagnostic accuracies that significantly outperform (a) individual radiologists using standard techniques, and (b) current state-of-the-art in software-only AI. As a product, the MedSwarm system will be deployed as downloadable software compatible with all existing radiological workstations. Distribution to diagnostic teams will be as easy as opening a web-browser and connecting to a cloud-based server. The market opportunity is best modeled on the Computer Aided Detection (CAD) market, which is projected at $1.9 Billion by 2022. MedSwarm will not compete with current CAD products, as it will provide additional accuracy on all radiology workstations, whether or not other CAD tools are in use.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop, test, and validate MedSwarm, the first commercially viable system for amplifying diagnostic accuracy of radiologists by combining human and machine intelligence. The technology, called Swarm AI, does not replace radiologists with AI, but connects small groups of radiologists together and optimizes their combined insights, enabling accuracy levels that greatly exceed baseline abilities. The company anticipates diagnostic error reductions of at least 30% using the system developed in Phase I, with the majority of the improvement being in the reduction of false-positives. The proposed research requires the development of new software modules, new optimization algorithms, and new interface protocols for enabling radiologists to connect online, view the same images at the same time, and work together as a real-time system to converge on unified diagnoses. Development also requires machine learning optimization across multiple experimental parameters, to reduce the time required for each diagnosis, increasing throughput and reducing costs. The company's goals for Phase I include a proof-of-concept system that (i) significantly outperforms individual radiologists, (ii) significantly outperforms state-of-the-art machine learning systems, and (iii) can identify which cases are most appropriate for this system, as compared to alternate methods.

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase I project focuses on the development and demonstration
    of a new high resolution X-ray detector to be utilized (initially) in medical
    diagnosis. The early work by NGS Detectors and collaborators has shown an improvement
    in resolution by a factor of almost 10 over the X-ray detectors in current use.
    The focus of this Phase I project is to now improve both the resolution and efficiency
    of the detector (in order to reduce the x-ray dose received by patients). The
    initial diagnostic application is for mammography, where the improved resolution
    is expected to allow accurate diagnosis of suspicious features in the breast at
    an early stage, while reducing the false diagnoses (both positive and negative)
    that are recognized to be problematic. The detectors have potential application
    in other medical diagnostics situations, such as neonatal and cardiovascular fields,
    where the higher resolution is expected to extend the application of X-ray diagnostics
    well beyond current practice. Applications for industrial nondestructive evaluation
    in fields such as semiconductor manufacturing are also envisaged. \n\nThis SBIR
    Phase I project focuses on the development and demonstration of a new high resolution
    X-ray scintillation detector. The indirect detector utilizes a new polymeric scintillating
    polymer developed by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories for security applications,
    and incorporates the material into an optical channel plate. The optical channel
    plate contains an ordered array of high quality capillaries (e.g. 10 micron diameter).
    The scintillating polymer absorbs X-rays, and emit photons that are channeled
    to pixels of an optical detector with minimal scattering. A resolution of 10 micron
    has already been demonstrated, an improvement of nearly an order of magnitude
    over both direct and indirect detectors in current use in medical diagnostics.
    The focus of Phase 1 is to complete the detector characterization, with a special
    emphasis on improving the detector efficiency in order to minimize X-ray dose
    rates for patients. The successful completion of Phase I will lead to a Phase
    II that demonstrates that the higher resolution indeed yields higher feature discrimination
    in realistic diagnostic situations.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission

    This SBIR Phase I project intends to design and develop an innovative medical device solution that can potentially save $1.16B to the overall US healthcare system by reducing the procedural time and decreasing the number of catheters and devices used in Peripheral Vascular lnterven6on procedures. Lower extremity peripheral arterial disease affects more than 8 million people in the United States alone. The annual healthcare expenditure spent on treating peripheral arterial disease is $4.37B. Since 2008, US Center for Medicare and Medicaid has been stressing for greater efficiency and lowering costs for Peripheral Vascular Intervention. Commonly performed Peripheral Vascular Intervention procedures in the CathLab, to treat PAD, encounter loss of guidewire access. This complication is amplified in the case of difficult to cross stenotic lesions and, in many cases, is frustrating for the physician as they have to spend several hours/procedures trying to regain guidewire access. Guidewire access is the key for a successful procedural outcome. The Project intends to reduce Peripheral Vascular Intervention cost by improving procedural efficiency by eliminating guidewire/catheter exchanges in current practice thereby reducing Cath Lab overhead costs and by reducing procedure time and effort required to acquire a good quality angiographic image. An important ancillary benefit of the innovation is that the radiation exposure to the healthcare providers and the patient can potentially be minimized due to the decreased fluoroscopic activity. The project aims to continue beyond SBIR Phase I to become a commercial product and be the standard of care for Peripheral Vascular Intervention procedures.

    This SBIR Phase I project is for the design and development of a .014-inch guidewire compatible low profile PTA balloon catheter with a proprietary contrast injection mechanism. This product is ideal for performing PTA interventions in difficult anatomical spaces e.g. below-the-knee peripheral vasculature. The proprietary inflation and injection system allows for treatment visualization without needing catheter exchanges or loss of guidewire access. The output of the Project intends to provide focused and sharper visualization along the entire treatment length and allows for judicious usage of radiopaque contrast in contrast sensitive patients. A feasibility prototype of the concept was tested in an animal model with promising results. The SBIR Phase I project is focused on overcoming technical challenges to design and develop the unique device design to maintain a statistically significant rated burst pressure, develop and evaluate device bond joints per ISO standard 10555-1 2013, Sterile Single Use Intravascular catheters, develop the manufacturing process and tools, to integrate the catheter multi functionality. The Project intends to design and fabricate a test fixture to simulate clinical usage of the Innovative device per FDA Class II Guidance Controls for Percutaneous Transluminal Balloon Catheters and confirm that the catheter satisfies customer requirements. The Development efforts as part of SBIR Phase I project involve utilization of iterative design process. 3-dimensional design modeling and optimization, creation of a test fixture to simulate clinical usage, iterative prototyping and testing efforts to ensure the desired device specifications are met.

    Phase I project will be to support the societal need for higher adoption of clean
    renewable energy.  The new kind of high-efficiency, lightweight and thin photovoltaic
    modules that will be enabled by this project will be ideal for integration at
    the factory with roofing materials for Commercial and Industrial (C&I) buildings.
    \ This will address half of the U.S. C&I rooftop market (low-slope metal roofs)
    that is poorly served by existing photovoltaic modules due to weight limits, wind-loading
    effects and other factors.  In addition, it will drop total C&I rooftop photovoltaic
    system cost by up to 40% through reduction of installation materials and labor,
    as well as simplification of system design, permitting, etc.  This disruptive
    innovation can turn C&I photovoltaic systems--today the smallest of the 3 major
    U.S. photovoltaic market segments--into a key driver for US solar growth.  This
    photovoltaic module product is ideally suited for US manufacturing.  \n\nThe SBIR
    Phase I proposed project will allow the first ever exploration of Silicon heterojunction
    solar cells with absorber thickness substantially below 40 microns.  Higher thickness
    silicon heterojunction solar cells have already achieved world record efficiency
    of over 26.5%.  For the ultra-thin silicon design targeted by this project, theory
    predicts an open circuit voltage (Voc) of at least 780mV, well in excess of current
    records for any silicon solar cell.  High Voc will reduce photovoltaic system
    resistive losses as well as minimizing system performance degradation from high
    operating temperatures.   With respect to solar wafer technology, this would be
    a new kerfless approach to realizing silicon heterojunction solar cells, leading
    to a new type of robust flexible thin photovoltaic module, with much higher efficiency,
    superior reliability, and lower cost compared to current flexible thin film photovoltaic
    options.  In this Phase I project we will target Voc of at least 720mV.   We will
    also investigate optimizing the rear reflector design for silicon heterojunction
    solar cells, to maximize light absorption in the thin silicon absorber layer.
    Finally, we will identify a detailed path forward to 24% efficiency for this solar

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this SBIR Phase I project to develop a portable chip-based diagnostic device to detect the biomarker troponin T in human blood for cardiac disease diagnosis. This nano-biosensor has the potential to improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. Many patients who experience chest pain, an early symptom of a heart attack (myocardial infarction, MI), are first seen by EMS (emergency medical services) and are transported to a hospital in an ambulance. EMS are equipped with electrocardiogram (EKG) devices, but approximately 40% of all heart attacks cannot be diagnosed with an EKG alone. This leads to longer wait times for a definitive diagnosis, causes difficulty for patient transport decisions, delays treatment for those experiencing a true MI, and causes unnecessary hospital admissions for patients who are later found not to have had a heart attack. Blood-based biomarker assays, which are currently not performed in a prehospital setting, are needed to reach a conclusive diagnosis for all heart attack types. A portable device to monitor troponin T in a prehospital setting would result in faster treatment via improved diagnosis, better routing of patients to appropriate medical centers, and a decrease in unnecessary hospital stays. The cardiac biomarker market, including troponin, is expected to grow to $9.9 billion by 2022.

    The innovation of the proposed technology lies in the metal nanostructures on the diagnostic chip. These nanostructures allow proteins to be delivered to the sensing area and detected in a high sensitivity manner, while excluding larger debris, such as blood cells. The proposed work will leverage optical techniques for real-time label-free detection of protein biomarkers at the nanostructured chip. The current method for manufacturing the detection chips is slow and uneconomical. This Phase I work will address the high-risk, high-reward technical challenges by creating a low-cost, high-throughput fabrication method to mass manufacture nanostructured chips with reproducible optical properties. Additionally, this Phase I work seeks to validate blood sample delivery to the sensing area and troponin T detection in blood using an integrated microfluidic device. The selectivity and specificity requirements will be addressed by attachment of custom DNA molecules to the sensing area. These pieces of DNA are designed to bind in a highly specific manner to troponin T only. The outcomes of this Phase I project will establish the scientific and technical foundations necessary to move into a Phase II project by developing a low cost and easy to use point-of-care device suitable for rapid prehospital diagnosis of heart attacks.

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase I project aims to demonstrate the technical feasibility
    of a microfluidic instrument as a clinical tool for measuring a new single-cell
    biophysical biomarker; mass accumulation rate (MAR). Successful completion of
    the proposed project will constitute the foundation of a medical instrument that
    will improve treatment strategies for cancer patients. Assigning the optimal therapy
    for individual patients is particularly important for the treatment of cancer,
    since every individual's cancer is unique. Although genetic profiling of tumor
    cells has been the gold standard for personalized medicine approaches in cancer,
    recent results demonstrate that only a small percentage of patients actually benefit
    from therapies specifically assigned for them. Aside from few cancer types, where
    drastic patient responses can be observed using genetic profiling, most cancer
    patients continue to suffer from ineffective or sub-optimal therapies, which in
    one of the main drivers of the cost of cancer treatment in the US. This stands
    in stark contrast to personalized medicine in infectious diseases, where almost
    all patients are prescribed optimal treatments determined by functional assays
    based on monitoring the proliferation of microbes ex vivo under the influence
    of a panel of drugs. Unfortunately, no proliferation-based test for cancer has
    proven to be sufficiently reliable to be widely adopted for clinical use, mostly
    because unlike bacteria most cancer cells quickly die when removed from the human
    body. This SBIR Phase I project will develop the techniques to measure MAR of
    cancer cells as a metric for drug response. MAR response reflects how individual
    cells change their growth in response to drugs in very short timescales without
    the long-term effects of ex vivo culturing. The research that will be conducted
    in this project will prove the technical feasibility of measuring MAR in a clinical
    setting for a panel of treatment options. Outcomes of this project will directly
    enable clinical studies to be conducted, before ultimately seeking FDA approval
    through clinical trials. \n\nThe focus of this project is a new technology known
    as the serial Suspended Microchannel Resonator (sSMR), which can measure mass
    and mass accumulation rates (MAR) of single cells with extreme precision. This
    SBIR Phase I project will test the technical feasibility of the sSMR platform
    for measuring drug susceptibility of primary tumor samples with a clinically and
    commercially relevant speed, versatility and robustness. The company aims to develop
    sSMR as a platform and introduce MAR as biophysical biomarker guiding clinicians
    in identifying the best therapy options for a specific cancer patient. Therefore,
    the goals of this first phase are critical, as tumor cells in biopsy samples taken
    from patients show differences in heterogeneity, count, and in most cases, lose
    their viability within 24-48 ex vivo. In Phase I, key technologies will be developed
    that will enable a sSMR chip to process samples with various cell types and counts
    at a high throughput and rate. The research activities to address the technical
    challenges for analyzing primary samples will be three-fold. First, while maintaining
    the measurement precision, the flow rate of cells in the chip will be increased
    to prevent primary tumor cells from adhering to channel walls. This is challenging,
    because the precision of measurement is inversely proportional to the time duration
    each cell spends in the chip. Second, an opto-fluidic switching technique will
    be implemented on chips with a new microfluidic T-junction design enabling imaging
    and characterization of particle morphology, and the avoidance of dead cells,
    debris, and doublets to improve assay robustness and throughput. Third, by leveraging
    the microfluidic T-junction and developed imaging capabilities, a microfluidic
    cell enrichment technique will be developed. This feature will allow for a larger
    panel of drug conditions to be tested on tumor biopsies with limited cell counts.
    For validation of these innovations, response of tumor cells taken from 10 multiple
    myeloma patients to a panel of three drugs and their combinations will be measured
    and analyzed.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be the development of an easy-to-apply anti-fouling, liquid- and sludge-repellent coating aimed to reduce the water footprint, required cleaning frequency, and need for aggressive cleaning chemicals to maintain bathroom fixtures. Advanced ecofriendly technologies that enhance cleaning efficiency are highly sought after in janitorial services for large institutions and homeowners alike. Specifically, the household cleaners market size was valued at $5.79 billion in 2016 in United States, of which ~20% is toilet bowl cleaners that aim to remove bacteria and hard-water stains.  From a societal perspective, we estimate that about 6.1 billion gallons of water is flushed down the toilet nationally each day - that is 2.2 trillion gal of water each year in the United States alone. Incorporation of this coating into bathroom fixtures, can significantly reduce the water footprint of bathroom fixtures. Viable low-flow or no-flow toilets may also help help address the open defecation problem affecting over 1 billion people globally.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop and investigate a new class of viscoelastic-repellent surface coatings with anti-bacterial and anti-scaling functions for cleaning and sanitation industries. Surface coatings that can resist bacteria and mineral fouling while maintaining both liquid and viscoelastic solid repellency are rare. The proposed project will investigate and quantify the coating design parameters required to significantly prevent the attachment of bacteria and mineral deposits, while remaining durable against mechanical abrasions under realistic operating conditions. This SBIR Phase I project will demonstrate that a sprayable surface coating not only can repel both liquids and viscoelastic solids, but can also resist fouling from bacteria and hard water stains without the use of aggressive chemical cleaners or excessive amounts of water. The best coating parameters identified in Phase I project will be considered for pilot tests in Phase II. The development of such a robust, non-fouling coating will offer significant reduction in the use of cleaning chemicals, flush water, and cleaning time, which has the potential to reduce costs associated with sanitation facilities maintenance.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to provide access to a solar heat source for controlled high temperature applications using minimal, low-cost equipment. The proposed Solar Concentrator Unit (SCU) is the first step to providing individuals and underserved communities with the freedom of a low-cost alternative to many of their most pressing manufacturing and materials processing needs. The SCU produces no emissions in its heat generation, requires no fuel costs, and can be used in remote locations to deliver precision control to high temperature thermal processes. Many new applications become available to market participants through the proposed innovation with the most notable commercial outcome being a multi-material additive manufacturing (i.e. 3D printing) system capable of producing custom metal and glass parts. Additional applications for the SCU include welding; recycling of waste material into useful feedstocks; pyrolysis of waste streams to render them chemically and biologically inert; sanitizing medical equipment in disaster response operations; and very high temperature materials science research by individuals and research institutions.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project explores the design and performance of a SCU for delivering high temperatures in the range of 65 ?C to 2,200 ?C over long durations (6+ hours). The technology relies on concentrated solar energy as the primary heat source with the proposed innovation being a feedback control system for maintaining temperature of a receiver plane to within +/-5% of an operating value. The proposed innovation addresses the limitations of existing methods for concentrating solar energy which lack temperature control and whose consistency of output thermal flux varies with time of day, sun position, cloud cover, and atmospheric conditions. This Phase I project will consist of development of a SCU prototype to conduct characterization tests on output solar flux and flux density under varying solar conditions. The expected outcome of this project will be to prove feasibility of the proposed design concept and evaluate its use for controlled, high temperature applications. The performance characteristics of the SCU will be fully explored in Phase I and the design of the SCU will allow for development of modular Thermal Processing Units in Phase II to interface with the concentrated solar spot produced by the SCU.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project focus on improving the indigo dyeing process. Indigo, a dye integral to denim production, is produced on an industrial scale of 65,000+ tons annually by chemical synthesis, and the molecule must be solubilized with a reducing agent before dyeing. Both processes involve hazardous chemicals like formaldehyde and hydrogen cyanide that are damaging to dye workers, production facilities, and the surrounding environment. Aniline, the petroleum byproduct required to create indigo, is toxic when ingested, inhaled, or in contact with skin and may be carcinogenic. Reducing agents are deadly for aquatic life when dumped as wastewater in the dyeing process or costly to clean up as part of wastewater treatment dyeing. Today the indigo market is approximately $500 M, with indigo selling just under $10/kg. The proposed project will develop a novel biological method to synthesize the reduced form of indigo directly.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will create a method to use Escherichia coli to biosynthesize an indigo precursor called indican, a stable, water-soluble molecule. With the introduction of a b-glucosidase, the indican is hydrolyzed and is converted to the water-soluble reduced indigo form, thus circumventing both the indigo chemical synthesis as well as the harmful reducing agent step. This indican method has been shown to work as an effective indigo dye on cotton fabric and yarns. To improve the process, the indican titer must be improved from the host strain. Two parallel strategies are proposed in this Phase I project: the indican pathway enzymes will be improved by directed evolution, and the fermentation process will be elongated by feeding key nutrients that the cell depletes, thus prolonging the productive lifespan of the fermentation. Currently the cells are fed tryptophan as a pathway precursor; this Phase I project also proposes engineering the cell to produce its own tryptophan.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be to promote empowerment of millions of blind and visually-impaired (BVI) people by enabling greater independence, supporting increased educational attainment, proliferation of vocational opportunities, and enhancing their overall quality of life. There are currently no commercial solutions for providing BVI users with an assistive technology (AT) solution that allows BVI users to seamlessly access textual and graphical information via a unified system. Towards meeting this greater goal, this Phase I SBIR project addresses key challenges relating to technical feasibility in creating the core algorithms of Midlina and the functional viability proving that BVI users will find practical utility in its application. By providing a much-needed AT solution leveraging touchscreen devices such as smart phones as a platform (which is already owned and used by more than 80% of BVI users), this project has a high probability of user adoption and market acceptance when commercialized. Given that vision loss is expected to double in the next 20 years owing to age-related eye diseases experienced by the rapidly aging population, this project will have significant economic benefits for the State/Federal agencies providing support services to BVI and aging population.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will show that a novel touchscreen-based information access software, called Midlina, will allow blind and visually-impaired (BVI) individuals to independently access textual and graphical information from digital media. The key innovation and strength of the proposed solution is in its ability to achieve this convergence of seamless text and graphical information access by integrating with native mobile operating systems (OS) used on smart touchscreen-based devices, the fastest growing computational platforms among BVI users. This project builds on strong theoretical underpinnings derived from 5-years of NSF-sponsored academic research involving hundreds of human testers and represents an excellent translational path towards commercialization. Two objectives will drive this Phase I project: (1) Developing a novel visual-to-multimodal conversion algorithm that is seamlessly integrated with a native mobile operating system, and (2) Establishing technical feasibility and practical usability of a prototype system through rigorous human user testing. A successful outcome of this Phase I project would lead to: (1) development of core algorithms for a novel touchscreen-based information access software, called Midlina, and (2) demonstrate feasibility that Midlina will enable BVI people to independently access both textual and graphical contents from digital media.

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enhance data security by solving the current
    problem of securing data in use through encryption. It has the potential to build
    trust on the cloud by overcoming the technical challenges of building a fully
    homomorphic encryption solution. This will allow data owners to encrypt their
    confidential data and process that encrypted data without constraints or having
    to decrypt it first. This important new capability will enable further data migration
    to the cloud and a new secure Encrypted Data-as-a-Service (EDaaS) model where:
    (i) confidential data can be used for analyses or machine learning while encrypted
    and as a service, without ever being decrypted or shared without encryption; and
    (ii) data owners can authorize users to access their encrypted data while maintaining
    control and authority.  In short, data owners will be able to securely migrate
    confidential data to the cloud and maintain full privacy and security, even for

    will investigate and validate the feasibility and performance of an innovative

    To prove feasibility, this Phase I project addresses three technical hurdles:
    (i) validation of the method to ensure the security of data and functions, (ii)
    optimization of performance relative to existing homomorphic encryption schemes,
    and (iii) connectivity to existing analytical tools and cloud environments to

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to rapidly enable new therapeutically relevant molecules currently impractical to manufacture with conventional techniques. Peptides represent a growing subset of the therapeutics market: there are about 68 currently approved peptide treatments; ~140 peptide treatments in clinical trials and another 500 peptide treatments in the preclinical stage, representing a $21 B market growing to $44 B by 2025. While peptides therapeutics are known for indications such as oncology, cardiovascular disease, and metabolic disease, recent interest in personalized peptide therapeutics has grown. Currently, peptides take weeks to synthesize and are tremendously resource-intensive, costing hundreds to thousands of dollars for a few milligrams of product. These high costs and long lead times severely limit the number of molecules a researcher can test in a given period of time, representing the primary bottleneck in peptide therapeutic innovation. Faster access to these potentially therapeutic relevant molecules will accelerate discovery of new therapeutics.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project overcomes the major bottlenecks of peptide manufacturing. The Rapid Automated Computation, Coupling, Cleavage, and Chromatography Execution (RAC4E) Platform produces high purity custom peptides. However, to further extend the ability to control process conditions and achieve real-time process optimization, we propose developing solid-phase slug flow (SPSF) coupling, using advanced engineering and machine learning solutions to generate purity in molecules during synthesis, enabling optimization of the peptide chain in real-time. Combining these solutions will allow the production of peptides both faster and at longer lengths, as well as dramatically reducing the need for downstream purification. Once fully implemented, the RAC4E platform with SPSF coupling will produce peptide libraries
    at a speed and purity that will significantly increase the density of biological screening data serving as machine learning inputs. The platform will be later be scaled into a cGMP manufacturing environment, accelerating the rate of entry for novel peptide therapeutics into the clinic.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) project is to improve manufacturing technology for the purification
    of monoclonal antibodies, which are important therapeutics as well as valuable
    tools in research and diagnostics. Approximately four new antibody drugs are approved
    every year, and while they can have tremendous clinical outcomes and are sometimes
    heralded as \"magic bullets,\" they often come with a significant price tag. This
    puts a strain on patients and insurance companies, limiting the accessibility
    of antibody-based drugs. Furthermore, antibodies are critical research tools that
    enhance the understanding of biology. The technology developed in this research
    project will provide a completely novel method for the purification of antibodies
    from cell culture that will lower cost, increase manufacturing throughput, and
    accelerate the time to market for new therapeutics. Commercially, this technology
    will disrupt the current gold standard - Protein A resin - making antibody purification
    simpler, faster, and cheaper at all scales: research, clinical, and industrial.
    \n\nThe intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase I project is to develop technology
    for improved purification of monoclonal antibodies.  Although upstream production
    of antibodies in cell culture has improved dramatically, downstream purification
    has not kept pace, resulting in a production bottleneck and a major market opportunity.
    The objectives of this SBIR Phase I project are to demonstrate technical and commercial
    feasibility of a new technology that combines affinity with liquid-liquid phase
    separation to separate antibodies from cell culture contaminants. It involves
    an antibody-binding domain fused to a biopolymer with stimulus responsive phase
    behavior. When this fusion protein is added to cell culture harvest, it binds
    the antibody and, after triggering the phase separation with salt, pulls the antibody
    out of solution. The purified antibody can then be eluted from the fusion by lowering
    the pH. This project aims to 1) optimize regeneration conditions so that the fusion
    can be reused, 2) evaluate long-term stability, and 3) validate the technology
    at scale and conduct a head-to-head comparison to the industry gold standard,
    Protein A resin. The goal is to identify storage conditions that provide a long
    shelf life for a product that can be reused 10-100 times without compromising
    antibody yield or purity. The focus of the project is to demonstrate promising
    capabilities of the technology for use in industrially manufactured monoclonal
    antibodies, replacing conventional chromatography steps with a simpler and more
    cost-effective method.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is the ability to detect and prevent fires in lithium-ion batteries. Lithium-ion batteries have become the preferred mode of energy storage and reuse in numerous applications ranging from mobile phones to aircraft. The low safety of current Li-ion batteries has led to a number of accidents in various applications ranging from computers to electric vehicles and aircraft.  Excessive heat release from one cell can compromise the safety of the entire battery pack and the host system. By eliminating the potential for fires in each cell, the proposed technology will enable the construction of larger format cells to reduce the battery integration costs. Improved safety also will usher in the move towards higher energy density cells and open new applications that can benefit from Li-ion batteries.  The projects potential societal impacts include significant revenues if successful, increased safety and even lives saved, increased penetration of energy storage and associated environmental impacts.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop an innovative technology to improve the safety of Li-ion batteries and prevent fire due to manufacturing defects, abuse and abnormal use. In today's batteries, these failures trigger exothermic reactions that can transition into uncontrolled thermal runaway. The resulting fires have impacted the safety of various systems ranging in scale from small (mobile phones and computers) to very large (aircraft). The objective of this effort is to develop a technology embedded in a compact sleeve that slides over the cells in a battery pack to passively detect the conditions and isolate the failing cells to prevent their thermal runaway. The Phase I research consists of designing the safety sleeves for select Li-ion battery chemistries and geometries, then demonstrating their effectiveness in detecting and preventing thermal runaway in both individual cells and in battery packs. The results from Phase I research will be used to design prototype sleeves for additional battery sizes, shapes and chemistries that will be tested further in Phase II.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will primarily benefit people with hand amputations. Touch feedback is a critical component of human manipulation, and its loss is most poignant in people with hand amputations. There are currently no prosthetic devices available to amputees that provide control through touch sensory feedback. Without touch feedback, prosthetic users tend to avoid manipulating many objects they otherwise could because they run the risk of destroying them. Consequently, there is a market need for a richly expressive sensory feedback system for upper limb prosthetics. The proposed research will yield a device capable of such feedback with electrotactile stimulation. These outcomes have the potential to restore a significant amount of function to over 10 million people with hand amputations worldwide and improve their quality of life.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project involves development of a portable, energy-efficient electrotactile stimulator that can be easily placed into the sockets of hand prosthetics to give users useful sensory feedback. The stimulator will integrate with existing prosthetic control systems. It will be built using standard off-the-shelf components, have a form factor small enough to easily fit into a variety of different prosthetic sockets, and operate for at least 12 hours while operating alongside a prosthetic hand and its control system. To improve sensation quality, a sensation controller that enables consistent long-term stimulation will be deployed, reducing the likelihood of device rejection due to discomfort. The expected outcomes of this research are 1) a portable, cost effective and energy efficient electrotactile stimulator that can be easily placed into the socket of a prosthetic user and integrated with their prosthetic hand; and 2) a user study which evaluates the effectiveness of this device deployed with a sensation controller for daily manipulation tasks. The capabilities of the Phase I prototype will be extended in Phase II for delivery of a market-ready sensory feedback system that is compliant with regulatory standards for medical equipment.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project comprises the development of a wearable system capable of accurately tracking glaucoma progression via continuous monitoring of intraocular pressure (IOP). Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world and affects nearly 80 million people worldwide. Using a novel wearable system, optometrists, ophthalmologists, and medical professionals across multiple disciplines can review the IOP trends at visits, monitor high-risk patients in real-time, and program patient-specific threshold alarms that will prevent irreversible blindness caused by glaucoma and related conditions. Through successful product commercialization, the novel wearable blindness prevention system (BPS) is expected to be adopted by approximately 2 million glaucoma patients annually. Users of the device will have continuous access to IOP data trends. Clinicians will be alerted when at-risk patients fail to comply with prescribed daily medicinal treatment (due to excessive IOP levels) and can continuously track the efficacy of prescribed IOP-lowering treatments. Finally, the IOP tracking capability of the system will allow improvements in the quality of care for general clinicians, medical specialists, and clinical researchers and will be a major player in the current move toward data-driven, value care.

    The intellectual merit of this project centers on laboratory feasibility testing of the fundamental concept behind the novel blindness prevention system technology - image-based pressure sensing - on a benchtop 3D-printed glaucoma simulator that is monitored using an alpha prototype of the system.  The research plan includes testing of the feasibility of a complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) camera which fits inside a pair of eyeglass frames, plus processor, optics, and software, as a way to record pressure changes in eye tissue in a benchtop environment. The key objective is to accurately - and with high repeatability - detect unhealthy eye pressure levels in the simulator using an alpha prototype, a-BPS, that communicates with a standard mobile device.  The target research outcome for the a-BPS is to successfully trigger a high-pressure alarm in a repeatable manner whenever eye pressure in the simulator exceeds a clinically-relevant threshold. It is anticipated that the Phase I research results will show successfully operation in 90% or more of the test samples. The output from the Phase I effort will be used as design inputs for a Phase II prototype, which will be wearable and will allow testing on humans.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a practical method for ultra-secure global communication using quantum key distribution (QKD). QKD is an established communications protocol which promises unbreakable encryption via the exchange of single photons, the constituent particles of light. Owing in large part to the lack of a practical way to connect users globally, QKD has not yet been widely deployed. This project aims to demonstrate the viability of high-speed, satellite-to-ground QKD using the low-cost CubeSat platform. If successful, this design will dramatically reduce the initial costs to launch a QKD constellation offering worldwide QKD connectivity, thereby greatly expanding the utility of QKD and driving market growth. Early customers will be the US Government and large businesses who are willing to pay a premium for the ultimate in data security. Government use offers clear societal benefit, as several agencies rely on secure global communications to ensure societal well-being. As technology advances, the network may be used to secure the communications of private citizens. The proposed plan will furthermore develop enabling technologies for future space-based quantum science experiments.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will produce designs for a high-speed QKD payload hosted on a CubeSat. The proposed design will take a substantial step forward from the first and only demonstration of satellite-to-ground QKD (Micius, 2017), which relied on technology that is too massive, expensive, and low-throughput for commercial use. Since CubeSats are heavily constrained in size, weight, and power, the major technical challenge will be to miniaturize the payload and reduce its power consumption while simultaneously improving data rates. To address this challenge, the small business will investigate a novel QKD payload concept that pushes the limits of emerging technologies in photonics and microelectromechanical systems. In Phase I, detailed modeling and simulation of candidate payload designs will be used to evaluate the commercial and technical feasibility of the proposed approach, and to select a preliminary design for initial implementation, which will commence in Phase II.

    of a new medical device designed to prevent deep vein thrombosis in hospitalized
    patients. Deep vein thrombosis occurs when blood clots form in the veins and is
    a common complication in hospital patients that is also a leading cause of preventable
    death in the United States. This project will develop a device that modifies blood
    flow patterns in the legs in a new manner designed to specifically activate genetic
    changes inside the vein that protect against blood clot formation. The goal of
    this project is to generate a new device that it is capable of creating the desired
    blood flow patterns in patients while maintaining a high level of device comfort,
    reliability, and ease of use for clinical staff and patients. In addition to preventing
    death and disability in the hospitalized population of the US, this project will
    move a new device towards commercial production, thereby supporting economic growth,
    job formation, and tax revenue. \n\nThis SBIR Phase I project will leverage novel
    molecular and cellular discoveries regarding the pathogenesis of deep vein thrombosis
    (DVT) to create a more effective device to prevent DVT in immobilized individuals
    who are at high risk for the disease. DVTs form in the sinus behind venous valves,
    where blood flow is reduced during immobility, promoting blood clot formation.
    This site is typically protected against clot formation by a powerful genetic
    program in the endothelial cells that is unique to the valve sinus microenvironment.
    Loss of this genetic expression program results in a prothrombotic environment
    that supports clot formation and DVT. Research has further revealed that the valve
    sinus anti-thrombotic genetic program is activated by a specific pattern of venous
    blood flow at that site that is driven by muscular activity. During prolonged
    periods of immobility, common during hospitalization, loss of this flow profile
    extinguishes the protective endothelial phenotype and supports DVT formation.
    Ultrasound analysis reveals that current mechanical therapy devices marketed to
    prevent DVT do not generate the hemodynamics at the valve that are produced by
    muscular activity due to their methods of action. This project will develop a
    device that generates a protective hemodynamic pattern in the valve sinus of immobile
    patients by actuating blood flow that accurately reproduce muscular activity.
    To accomplish this goal the device design alters the primary physical manipulation
    strategy of other existing devices away from calf and thigh compression and instead
    induces rapid calf expansion to replicate the effect of muscular activity on venous
    blood flow. Vascular ultrasound studies demonstrate that this actuation method
    successfully recapitulates the venous hemodynamics of the active limb required
    to support expression of the protective genetic pathway in the valve sinus. This
    SBIR Phase I project will optimize the device design to create this actuation
    while also improving patient comfort, mitigating common risks, and facilitating
    ease of use by clinical staff. This project will address key risks in advancing
    a medical device into clinical testing and use, thereby enabling the device to
    bridge to a phase of commercial manufacturing and use.\n\nThis award reflects
    NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will be functional neuronal cells derived from human adult adipocytes that will have applications in regenerative medicine.  The goal is to develop dopaminergic (DA) neural progenitor cells (NPCs) from transdifferentiated human adult adipocytes using a DA cell induction cocktail.  This will have application in cellular therapeutics and research tools for Parkinson's Disease (PD), and other neuronal diseases. In addition, these studies will impact the field of stem cell research and regenerative medicine, since this will be the first demonstration that functional neuronal cells, the main building blocks of brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nervous systems, can be produced from mature fat cells that can be used as cellular therapeutics for several neurological disorders.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop new technology for generation of midbrain dopaminergic (DA) neural progenitor cells (NPCs) from adult adipocytes (fat cells), which will used as a platform to develop cellular therapeutics for Parkinson's Disease (PD), and PD research tools. Recently, using a chemical genetics approach (chemical approach or small molecule approach), engraftable midbrain DA neuronal progenitor cells (DA NPCs) from human bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-hMSCs) have been generated. Additionally, DA neuronal progenitor-like cells also had been produced from de-differentiated fat cells (DFAT cells) that have several advantages over BM-hMSCs such as homogeneity of DFAT cell cultures, ease of isolation and low immunogenicity. The goal of Phase I project is to validate and optimize the DA induction protocol for generation of midbrain DA NPC from DAFT cells. Phase II will focus on clinical grade manufacturing of these DA cells and testing their therapeutic effect in several preclinical animal models of PD. Commercial products emerging from Phase I/II work include cellular therapeutics for PD and research tools for PD.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will result from advancing the application territory of Internet-of-Things (IoT) and 4G/5G/Beyond-5G ecosystems. If successful, the obtained results would directly benefit a large portion of the current 8.4 billion wirelessly "connected things" with an estimated $273 billion market. It will facilitate "always-on, anytime, anywhere" network services and further help enable many emerging IoT applications (e.g., safe driving, remote healthcare, smart city, wearables). The technology is expected to create new business opportunities for IoT vendors, service providers, and mobile virtual network operators. If successful, it will facilitate evolution from an operator-centric network ecosystem to a user/application-centric ecosystem.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a software-based solution to enabling dependable, software-defined network services for IoT applications. The objective for Phase I is to provide "always-on, anytime, anywhere" network service for billions of IoT devices and applications. Different from the current infrastructure-based solutions (using software-defined networking or network slicing), the proposed technology offers an in-device, SIM-based software solution without infrastructure upgrades or added device hardware. It enables in-SIM visibility to "black-box" mobile network operations, performs in-device optimizations using readily available mechanisms, and offers further value-added cloud services for network-wide optimization and management via crowdsourcing. The technology is readily deployable on today's IoT devices (both low-end and high-end) and provides "must-have" features for two customer segments (validated through NSF I-Corps interviews) - IoT mobile virtual network operators, and IoT application vendors.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to provide a better and safer alternative to conventional piezoelectric ultrasonic instruments that use liquid-coupled transducers for the inspection of pipelines, tanks, and other structures used in power generation and liquid process industries. This new instrument does not require the use of liquid coupling, and can work on rough, coated, or contaminated surfaces that cannot be inspected with conventional liquid-coupled techniques unless the part is subjected to costly and time consuming part preparation. By not using liquids, this instrument can also be used on components that are very hot, very cold, radioactive, or in a vacuum. A high-resolution ultrasonic instrument that does not use couplant and has comparable performance to a piezoelectric instrument will save inspection time, reduce inspection costs, and permit inspections while in-service, which will result in millions of dollars in savings for plant operators. Society as a whole will also benefit from improvements in safety and performance of the plants, and by reducing the amount of waste and contaminants released into the environment as direct sub-product of the inspection, or from failures in facilities and equipment.

    The proposed project consists of the development of a portable, high-resolution, ultrasonic phased array instrumentation, software, and transducers based on non-contact Electro Magnetic Acoustic Transducer (EMAT) technology to substitute or complement the tens of thousands of conventional piezoelectric instruments in the market. For the instrumentation, the research will revolve around the development of a high-power and compact 16-channel pulser/receiver with a very small dead zone that permit inspection near the surface of the part. This instrumentation will also require custom software with signal-enhancing algorithms that compensate for the small amplitude of EMAT signals. The 16-channel phased-array EMAT transducers will involve multi-physics simulation of electrical and magnetic components to develop very small and high-density coil elements that can produce enough signal amplitude at high-frequencies while handling the pulsing rates required for effective inspection, and the high-power generated by the custom instrumentation. All these components will need to be enclosed in a battery-powered package that can be used in the harsh conditions typically found in field inspections. The expected result is a portable instrument that can compete in performance with conventional piezoelectric instruments, especially in applications and inspection environments where a conventional instrument is not practical or very costly to use.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to develop a resonant sensor system to monitor cell viability in small bioreactors.  Cell factories are responsible for producing more than $150B worth of cell therapies, protein therapies, industrial enzymes, and small molecules each year.  At the development phase, there are few technologies to monitor viable cell concentration, a critical quality attribute in a large array of bioreactors.  Current methods to monitor cell viability are labor intensive, expensive, and can compromise quality.  The proposed technology could be embedded into the walls of disposable flasks and bioreactors to provide real-time measurement of viable cell concentration.  This could enable substantial "big data" improvements for bioprocess developers, clonal selection, and small batch production.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to demonstrate passive, wireless sensing of viable cell concentration with resonant sensors.  Dielectric probes are used in industry to correlate culture capacitance to viable cell concentration in large culture volumes. In this proposal, the change in culture capacitance in small culture volumes could be wireless reported with a passive sensor embedded as part of the disposable culture flask or single-use bioreactor.  In this form factor, it would never make contact with the cell product, would be wirelessly implemented, and would have potential to be easily multiplexed.  Technical objectives for this work are 1) determining the extent of confounding signal effects from movement, media composition and temperature; 2) building a Bluetooth enabled reader pad for implementation in an incubator; and 3) developing an algorithm that translates the complex resonant sensor amplitude and phase data into simple parameters that can be used to track viable cell concentration.  In addition, the plan is to model and test the effect of resonator geometry, material composition, and sensor placement.  The goal is to produce a robust sensor system for cell viability to test in real culture conditions on numerous cell types.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
    Phase I project is to save lives through the proliferation of miniaturized automated external
    defibrillators that attach to smartphones. Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) will kill more than 325,000
    Americans this year outside of the hospital. An SCA can cause death if it is not treated in
    minutes. If an AED is available, it can save a person's life; some estimates suggest a 27% increase
    in the number of people who could be saved if AEDs are available and used when needed. A
    miniaturized AED embedded in a smartphone case could save lives by making AEDs more
    available and ensuring those who carry them are reachable by emergency medical services. The
    strategy is to equip law enforcement, firefighters, EMS personnel, and potential citizen first responders
    with this device and use smartphone technology to ensure they are reachable when
    in proximity to someone experiencing an SCA. It provides an opportunity for a new paradigm in
    first response: AED carriers that can be located during the first critical moments of an SCA.
    Through this research, hundreds of thousands of lives can be saved each year.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will prove out the concept of a
    regulatory-compliant miniaturized AED that integrates with a smartphone. The work includes
    researching and designing components and electronics that will enable creation of this critical
    medical device and accomplish three overarching goals: (1) design and develop the miniaturized
    components, interconnects, firmware and software necessary to implement the hand-held AED
    Smartphone case in Phase Two by evaluating high voltage power supply and switching
    electronics and completing a power converter and switching design capable of generating the
    required energy from an on-board lithium-ion battery and supporting a bi-phasic waveform; (2)
    develop the smartphone software and firmware necessary to implement the device itself, guide
    a user through the emergency protocol, and send GPS information to EMS to allow them to
    locate proximal first responders; (3) integrate the hardware and software into a prototype that
    demonstrates a path to a form factor function unit in Phase 2. Research and designs of
    interconnects and encapsulation methods developed as part of this effort will offer insight into
    the miniaturization of myriad electronics both within and outside the medical domains.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project relates to the historic challenges associated with composite manufacturing, including long cycle times, poor recyclability, labor-intensive manufacturing, and energy-intensive curing processes. Thermoplastic composites have the potential to reduce cycle time, reduce labor requirements, and improve recyclability; however, traditional thermoplastic processes are energy intensive. This Phase 1 SBIR is seeking new, more efficient process heating methods that can be integrated into a continuous composite manufacturing process to improve production speed and reduce operating costs, enabling the growth of composite materials in weight sensitive industries that require high-volume, low-cost structural components, including automotive, unmanned aircraft, wind turbines, and cargo transportation.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will determine the technical feasibility of ultrasonic heating and induction heating as an alternative to infrared heating in a continuous composite forming process. Process heating constitutes a significant portion of the direct energy consumed by in manufacturing. This is particularly true in the production of fiber-reinforced thermoplastic composites, where the polymer matrix must be melted as part of the consolidation process. As part of this Phase 1 project, heater modules for induction heating, ultrasonic heating, and infrared heating will be developed and integrated into a bench-scale, continuous composite forming prototype. Composite material will be produced using each heating method and energy consumption will be monitored during the forming process. The composite material produced during testing will be weighed and embodied energy will be calculated by dividing the total energy consumed by the mass of the material. The objective of this work is to identify a heating method that can reduce embodied energy by at least 40%, relative to the infrared heating system.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project lies in the replacement of key petroleum-based chemicals used in the paints and coatings industry, representing a $7B industry that is growing at 7% per year. The total addressable market includes 3 similar diols: 1,4-butanediol (1,4-BDO), 1,5-pentanediol (1,5-PDO), and 1,6-hexanediol (1,6-HDO). In this project, 1,5-PDO is produced from furfural, a chemical made from renewable agricultural residues such as corn cobs and wood chips.  Bio-based 1,5-PDO can be readily substituted for 1,6-HDO in many applications due to its analogous molecular structure and is similar enough to 1,4-BDO that it can be substituted for it in some applications. Rigorous technoeconomic analysis shows that this "green" 1,5-PDO can be made at 3x lower costs than oil-derived 1,5-PDO, opening new opportunities for its use as a renewable monomer for paints, coatings, adhesives and plastics.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project will allow the technology to be developed with commercially available fixed bed pellet catalysts to prepare the technology for scale-up.  Thus far, the technology has been demonstrated in small scale fixed bed reactors with powder catalysts.  A commercial scale process requires the use of pelletized catalysts due to inoperable pressure drops over powder catalysts in commercial-scale reactors. The higher flowrates inherent with larger scale reactors cannot flow through the tightly packed powder catalysts and cause a large degree of backpressure upstream of the catalyst bed; thus, pelletized catalysts must be sourced from commercial vendors and tested for activity and stability prior to scaling.  The next phase in technology development is to scale up the process by >100x, enabling testing and validation of larger amounts of the bio-based 1,5-PDO product in potential customers' product lines.  This SBIR Phase I project will also allow completion of the process design work needed to estimate the economics at commercial scale.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to use novel energy harvesting techniques to benefit the expanding wearables market and improve the lives of patients who use prosthetics and orthotics. New integrated circuit technology enables vibration energy harvesting from a physically much smaller vibration harvester. These smaller harvesters enable multiple applications. For example, battery life in wearables to track heart rate and steps walked could be extended. Also, fabric-based vibration energy harvesting applications could be realized in military and first responder uniforms to power communication devices. Similarly, for commercial markets clothing-integrated sensors for digital health applications could be powered by vibration harvesting. Finally, first markets will be explored for vibration harvesting systems integrated in prosthetics or orthotics to improve the quality of life for patients.  A sensor system in orthotics could detect medical complications in patients suffering from diabetic neuropathy.   These new energy harvesting circuits could potentially also power sensors integrated into prosthetics that could identify structural and mechanical problems.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project develops a vibration energy interface circuit that allows cold start-up from record low voltages and low currents using novel CMOS (Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor) design techniques. These CMOS design techniques use only one vibration harvester input to charge large loads such as 100µF capacitors without the use of a transformer or Schottky diodes.  Lowering the minimum start-up voltage in a vibration harvesting interface circuit has been a significant area of circuit research in integrated circuit design over the last decade. The innovation proposed for this SBIR Phase I project uses a classic Cockcroft-Walton charge pump with large off-chip 100µF capacitors. The charge pump's rectification is designed in CMOS to allow leakage-based signals to form and switch the charge pump's rectification from cold start-up. In this project there will be continued research into integrated circuit techniques and solutions to lower the minimum start-up voltage in a circuit interface to a vibration harvester.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to commercialize an automatable microfluidic technology capable of disrupting the existing sample preparation market. This market, projected to surpass $5.32 billion USD by 2025, is driven by the development of new and automatable technology platforms. These technology platforms not only facilitate the development of precision medicine, but also our understanding of the fundamental mechanisms behind cellular behavior. Here, automated sample preparation platforms are favored for their ease of use and integration potential with both upstream cell capture technologies (e.g. single cell selection, rare cell enrichment) as well as downstream analysis technologies (e.g. DNA/RNA sequencing, mass spectrometry). Rather than requiring scientists to reproduce complex in-house protocols developed by different academic laboratories, automated platforms would allow users the freedom of simply loading a sample and walking away. However, existing platforms in this market are limited by their fundamental single-compartment design, making the processing of complex systems highly challenging.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to demonstrate the feasibility of a fundamentally different approach to multi-omic single cell processing. Instead of relying on a single-compartment design (e.g. droplet microfluidics, microwell technologies, valved and chambered microchannels, tube-based kits, etc.) for cell processing, this project will use novel micropillar-based microfluidic technology for high efficiency separation and isolation of single cell omes. Here, micropillar arrays within our microfluidic channels serve to physically size-separate genomic DNA from proteins and RNA during cell lysis in a manner compatible with existing analysis methods. In Phase I, we will build upon our preliminary results by demonstrating bi-omic isolation of the genome and transcriptome from the same cell along with the ability to amplify and sequence the genomic DNA before and after bisulfite treatment for tri-omic isolation of the genome, transcriptome, and methylome.

  title: 'SBIR Phase I:  Direct Optical Lithography of Functional Inorganic Nanomaterials'
- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this SBIR Phase I project
    is to develop a desalination system powered by solar energy.  Water is used for
    lithium and rare metal mining,  requiring energy-efficient water treatment to
    produce fresh water and concentrated brines.  This type of water treatment in
    mineral recovery systems can yield valuable critical materials as byproducts.
    Many lithium and rare metal mining fields are located in regions in the US where
    solar energy is abundant.  Energy efficiency in traditional distillation processes
    must be significantly improved to make water treatment economical. The use of
    solar energy to power the proposed system also reduces or eliminates the need
    for transporting fuel for deployments of the process in remote areas.  \n\nThe
    proposed Phase I project will develop a system using solar energy to treat salty
    tailing waters through thermal desalination by an integrated system of lithium
    bromide (LiBr) multi-effect distillation (MED) dryer. The system also includes
    a second MED with mechanical vapor compression (MVC) and a LiBr regenerator. All
    the electrical and thermal energy used in the system are converted from solar
    heat.  The water treatment process includes lithium and rare metal recovery as
    well.  The design incorporates a distillation system with mechanical vapor compression.
    Comparing to traditional MED, our unique design enables our system to be 10-20
    times more compact than traditional MEDs.  During the Phase I project, the company
    will develop physics-based models to analyze the technology, as well as build
    and evaluate small prototypes to confirm the feasibility. The proposed integrated,
    enhanced and compact MED plus MVC equipment can intensify the heat and mass transfer
    processes and reduce heat losses. By integrating multi-cylinder configurations
    in one single cylinder or similar configurations, our equipment designs will exceed
    those of traditional MED systems. Modeling and simulation of the proposed distillation
    system show up to 10-fold improvement in energy efficiency.\n\nThis award reflects
    NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation

    Research (SBIR) project addresses one of the largest problems facing the aging
    U.S. power grid: integrating distributed energy assets to proactively supply clean

    generators.  The proposed innovation, a blockchain-enabled \"Virtual Power Plant\"
    (VPP) network that autonomously aggregates power from distributed energy assets,
    will allow retail consumers to sell excess power (derived from clean energy) to
    promote decentralization without sacrificing grid stability, with potential for
    saving upwards of $10 B/year on transmission and distribution losses alone.  This

    while enabling the utility and/or grid operator to maintain observability, retain
    grid control, and obviate regulatory hurdles that other grid modernization efforts
    may encounter.  The further benefits of a blockchain-based VPP are inherent cybersecurity,
    full transparency over how much electricity comes from renewable sources, as well
    as an immutable record of how much energy is stored/available in Behind-the-Meter

    \ The core objectives are to: i) build the database comprising operational data
    from power electronics components representative of the nearly 2 million residential
    solar installations in the US; ii) develop the energy tokens that are ascribed
    to the energy unit data from the database; and develop the smart contract framework

    Phase I project is to open new frontiers in medical imaging by introducing an
    innovative architecture for ultrasound systems. Ultrasonography is a widely used
    approach to perform clinical diagnosis and guide therapeutic procedures. However,
    technological bottlenecks in ultrasound engines currently prevent data intensive
    applications. By bringing the computational power directly within the ultrasound
    engine, this project will allow 3D functional ultrasound imaging in real-time
    with the highest quality. The innovation proposed will allow the generation of
    new ultrasound devices able to visualize body tissues in exceptional details and
    powered with data-driven computer-aided diagnostic applications. For the first
    time, ultrasound systems will have enough quality data to use algorithms of artificial
    intelligence (AI), which are expected to reduce time and costs associated with
    ultrasound analysis as well as improve patient outcomes. This project will also
    contribute to the advancement of research in the field of medical applications
    of ultrasonography technology by allowing the generation of new tools to be used
    in Research Institutes worldwide. \n\nThe proposed project will shift the paradigm
    in ultrasound engines. Today, ultrasound data-intense applications are restricted
    by the limitation in transmission speed of signals from the ultrasound engine
    to a computer where they have to be processed. This project proposes to integrate
    specialized computational power inside the ultrasound engine to allow real-time
    signal processing and image analysis where the signal is collected, hence reducing
    the requirements for the data transmission and processing. The activities proposed
    for this Phase I project will allow the company to build and validate a functioning
    prototype of high-performance scalable hardware architecture. The ability of the
    prototype to perform ultra-fast frame-forming imaging will be validated by simulating
    data-intensive operations. Concurrently, a minimal viable software will be developed
    to control, analyze and display in real-time the volume of data produced by the
    hardware, and to dynamically load applications and algorithms for clinical use.
    The feasibility study performed in this Phase I project will constitute the basis
    to expand the operation capabilities of the software platform and assess the ability
    of the prototype to perform real-time high speed imaging and recognition of bodily

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will result from the ability to deploy Artificial Intelligence (AI) to enable rapid and automated detection of breast cancers in mammograms, with the added benefit of greater training of the systems of models on data across a range of demographics, where variability could potentially cause increased errors or inadvertent bias. Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women and the second leading cause of cancer deaths among women. X-ray mammography screening is an effective tool for reducing mortality among women, but the high volume of mammograms generated every year, combined with the visual challenges of identifying subtle abnormalities in a complex background, makes mammogram analysis a difficult task. This project proposes an AI-based system able to autonomously analyze mammograms to help radiologists in this task, with a broad dataset covering multiple demographics. The proposed solution will save the time of radiologists, allowing the healthcare system to care for women more efficiently, while providing high accuracy and reducing variability of interpretation. The proposed solution may result in a broader adherence to mammography screening programs, marked reduction in breast cancer mortality, and significant cost savings for society. Additionally, this project may lead to improved treatments of other types of cancer.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to develop an algorithm to reduce bias in AI methods for breast imaging in order to extend their use to under-represented demographic groups. Most mammogram databases currently available to train AI models are potentially undertrained for use in under-represented populations because of the limited origin of the test and training data, potentially leading to errors or reduced accuracy when used on other populations. This project proposes a data augmentation procedure to reduce bias by synthetically increasing the number of training examples for under-represented demographics. Firstly, demographic information will be extracted from available databases, and biasing factors will be identified. Then, a new procedure will be established and used to generate highly realistic synthetic mammograms to increase the number of training examples in the original database. The benefits obtained with this procedure will be assessed by training an AI on the original and on the augmented databases and comparing performances in terms of area under the receiving operator characteristic. At the completion of this Phase I project, the augmentation procedure will be ready for testing on under-represented minorities.

    Research (SBIR) or STTR Phase I project is to develop and commercialize a technology

    in electric vehicle, transportation, and energy storage applications. Li-ion battery
    technology is one of the most transformative innovations in the past decade and
    continues to provide a platform for future technology development. The potential
    market size for Li-ion battery technology is substantial. Fueled by growth in
    energy storage and electric vehicle industries the Li-ion battery market is expected
    to grow to over US$100 billion by 2025. Adoption of Li-ion battery technology
    in the energy storage market being impeding by safety concerns, namely fire and

    the potential to be a low-cost, passive solution to mitigate these hazards, and

    \n\nThis Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will explore

    hazards. For large multi-cell battery systems in energy storage, vehicle applications
    and among others, these hazards can damage nearby infrastructure and cause injury
    or death. Li-ion batteries can undergo a self-heating failure called thermal runaway
    that releases flammable gases. Thermal runaway poses significant challenges for
    available fire and explosion suppression systems because the gas release can continue
    unabated despite suppression of the incipient fire. Current mitigation approaches
    treat the consequences of the fire and do not address the root cause of the hazard,
    namely the production of flammable gases. The approach here is to develop technology
    to mitigate the root cause of the hazard and reduce the flammability of the battery
    gases. There is a clear need to increase the scientific understanding of passive
    mitigation mechanisms of hazardous and flammable gases in the thermal runaway

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is twofold. (1) Capturing business opportunities in the athleisure market by providing functional textiles with radiative cooling capabilities. As climate change has led to more hot summer days, clothing with advanced cooling features will have significant public safety values. The global cooling fabrics market is projected to grow at a 10% annual rate from $1.8 Billion to $2.9 Billion by 2021. Cooling fabrics conventionally rely upon sweat wicking, and no major brand has incorporated radiative cooling technologies in textiles. MetaRE fabrics will address this unmet need by delivering a novel cooling technology substantially more efficient than sweat wicking. (2) Alleviating the environmental impact of the textile industry. Each year, 63 million tons of synthetic fibers are produced. These fibers turn into 300 billion square meters of textiles, which go through the clothing value chain, and ultimately turn into textile waste. This vast and growing stream of textile waste is creating a massive environmental burden. By introducing nanoscale air voids into fibers, MetaRE fabrics will reduce the consumption of petrochemicals by 30% and will use 50% less dye to reach desired color brightness and saturation.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will establish design and manufacturing technologies for creating radiative cooling fibers and fabrics. The prototype polymer fabrics will have three unique features: superior opacity, radiative cooling, and brilliant metallic luster, all resulting from nanoscale air filaments embedded in the fibers. The radiative cooling feature, in particular, is due to a combination of strong and broadband reflectivity of the fiber in the solar spectrum and high emissivity of the fiber in the thermal radiation spectrum. Research objectives of this SBIR Phase I project include: Develop melt and wet extrusion recipes to produce nanostructured polymer fibers with proper morphology, optical and thermodynamic properties, and mechanical strength; Demonstrate optical, thermodynamic, and mechanical performance of radiative cooling fabrics. To overcome obstacles to industrial adoption, the fiber production processes will require relatively minor changes to existing fiber extrusion equipment, and fibers produced will need to meet mechanical and throughput requirements comparable to those for conventional fibers. A set of optical and thermodynamic techniques and tools will be developed to characterize the spectral properties of the fibers and fabrics from the ultraviolet to the long-wavelength mid-infrared and to quantify the radiative cooling capabilities of the finished fabrics.

    parents and teachers can easily find, buy and adopt high-quality digital content
    for their children. Games, e-books and other digital learning tools show significant

    children) spend more screen time than their higher income counterparts, and their
    teachers are twice as likely to report improved student achievement from using
    educational technology. Despite increasing supply and demand related to digital

    and educators do not find choices mapped to their needs. As a result, 30 million
    U.S. children living in low-income families lack access to relevant content, 55%
    of parents and 80% of teachers cannot find what they are looking for and content
    producers face significant challenges to sustainability. By offering a broad selection
    of high-quality, cross-platform digital learning content via a platform optimized

    achieve significant advances in access, impact and revenue. Using feedback from
    a Phase I prototype, this project will scale to reach the 3 million U.S. teachers
    who currently use digital learning products in the classroom and the 30 million

    to digital learning distribution that meets teachers and parents where they are,
    but fundamentally disrupts their current expectations for effective content. As
    the first project to connect web-based, evidence-based digital learning tools
    with educators at scale, there are significant risks. The technical requirements
    for creating a one-stop shop for web-based learning tools are evolving daily from
    how to support the development of more high-quality HTML5 content, to how to best
    sell and deliver access codes for cross-platform/cross-device delivery, to how
    to ensure ease of download and adoption by educators despite limited bandwidth.
    Development in HTML5 offers an emerging opportunity to more efficiently target
    a global audience without maintaining multiple versions of the same application
    and improve educational connections between home and school. However, many digital
    learning developers lack the resources to convert high-quality content to HTML5
    without the support of a sustainable distribution platform. This project will
    create a web-based e-commerce application optimized for delivery of cross-platform
    content, a searchable inventory of high-quality digital learning products mapped
    to educational standards and a data/feedback loop designed to improve long-term
    satisfaction, sustainability and efficacy. Phase I R&D efforts will use surveys,
    virtual focus groups and educator journals/interviews to test the technical and
    commercial feasibility of both the supply side and demand side of a new platform.\n\nThis

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project will result from improving economic sustainability
    for farmers and autonomously identifying business cases for collaborative farming
    through sourced-out jobs that can be more effectively done by other farmers for
    a number of reasons such as proximity to job sites and availability of resources.
    The market currently focuses on the efficiency of equipment and inputs utilization
    for precision farming to improve profits. The proposed project will boost profits
    further by optimizing end-to-end farm processes that implicitly drive the efficient
    usage of equipment, labor, and fuel. The proposed project can potentially save
    213 million gallons of fuel burn per year across the US (covering 253 million
    acres), which in turn will reduce emissions and improve air quality. The fuel
    savings will result from optimizing the idle, load, unload and drive times of
    the equipment. Broadly, farmers today consider process variability of farming
    as part of the business due to a lack of process and financial impact measurement
    systems, which results in failing to capture unrealized profits of $100K-$300K
    on a typical 10,000 acre farm lot. Healthcare and manufacturing are example industries
    that have controlled process variability by using process and performance measurement
    systems. The proposed innovation will enhance scientific and technological understanding
    of controlling process variability in agriculture by autonomously measuring the
    time and cost of end-to-end farm processes and identifying common root causes
    and cost drivers. The innovation will provide win-win economic sustainability
    for both small and large farmers. \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research
    (SBIR) Phase I project identifies hard to track operating inefficiencies, with
    a financial impact that results in capturing unrealized profits for farmers. Today,
    farmers use averages to track operating spend and are not able to track the actual
    spend allocation to services and activities by field and per acre. Farmers today
    do not have a full view of actual operating performance across the on-farm supply
    chain, which in turn prevents them from analyzing the financial impact of how
    they work. Due to process variability, farmers often ignore operating inefficiency
    instead of measuring and analyzing the financial impact of such operating inefficiency
    and putting in place contingency plans and operating controls to mitigate operating
    losses. The research objective of Phase I is to show farm managers their unrealized
    profits due to operating inefficiency, and automatically identify root causes
    for farmers to manage cost drivers through better planning and controls to capture
    unrealized profits of $100K-$300K for every 10,000 acres. The proposed research

    actuals against target performance metrics. It will also identify root causes
    and cost drivers that, when controlled, can boost profits. The anticipated results
    will typically improve profits for farmers by 2-5% and create economic opportunities
    for small farmers through collaborative farming.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project will result from helping 50 million Americans
    (or 1 billion people worldwide) who have hearing loss to hear clearly. Hearing
    loss is now the fifth leading cause of years lived with disability worldwide and
    will climb higher with aging of the population. For older adults, hearing loss
    is the third most common physical condition after heart disease and arthritis.
    Moreover, half of people with hearing loss are actually working age and younger,
    and there is a significant association of hearing loss with decreased employment
    and lower income. As hearing solutions become more affordable and accessible like
    glasses and contact lenses, more manufacturers (including manufacturers of consumer
    headsets) will look for a standard platform to turn their product into a hearing
    aid. This novel solution is a software technology to turn any hearing device/aid
    into a self-customizable hearing aid, which will dramatically improve access.
    The innovation will enhance scientific and technological understanding of how
    to attain optimal hearing clarity. Hearing loss will no longer be a challenge,
    and hearing aids will become as easy to access, afford, and wear as lenses. \n\nThis
    Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a direct
    and repeatable way for people to set up their hearing aids or hearing devices
    at home. Unlike the current hearing test, which measures hearing thresholds and
    requires expensive sound booth equipment and middlemen professionals, this novel
    technology optimizes for improved perception of speech and is similar to the vision
    test where one looks through lenses and is asked which lenses are clearer. The
    technology provides personalized sound profiles for every user and enables the
    entire process of attaining hearing clarity to be done at-home. In other words,
    people can personalize and try out their hearing profile before purchasing a hearing
    aid/device (through their own smartphone and earbuds), and then set up their hearing
    aid/device in a similar way. This improves access and satisfaction while significantly
    decreasing price. Development will utilize mobile, web, and cloud technologies,
    as well as IoT connectivity, machine learning, and data analysis. This Phase I
    project will establish feasibility of the technology and is expected to result
    in a connected mobile/web software app that is able to consistently arrive at
    optimal personalized user sound profiles.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory

    Innovation Research (SBIR) project is  technology that can provide a transformational
    reduction in how much freshwater power plants and industrial processes utilize
    for their cooling needs. One of the US's largest water withdrawal uses is power
    plants, which account for 39% of total US freshwater withdrawals, mostly for cooling.
    Cooling towers account for most of the water consumption of the power industry
    (~1 trillion gallons per year). The product addresses this problem by capturing
    water from cooling tower plumes so that the water can be re-used.  This enables
    reduction of consumption of water drawn by the power plant (through re-use) by
    20%, which means large cost savings to the plants themselves and large savings
    of water for the community they operate in, allowing that water to be utilized
    for other important uses.  \n\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a
    commercial proof-of-concept of water capture technology for cooling towers used
    in power plants and industrial processes. The novel technology uses electric fields
    to ionize the air around a cooling tower outlet, charge the escaping water leaving
    cooling towers and direct the water toward a mesh-based collector, where it collects
    and drips toward a collection tank on the periphery of the cooling tower. Throughout
    Phase I of the SBIR, the research will focus on verifying the quantity of collectable
    water droplets in the plumes of the cooling towers, developing durable electrode

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will be the acceleration of discoveries in microbiome science by wider adoption of whole metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing. These DNA and RNA sequencing techniques are the gold standard for data generation in microbiome-based drugs and diagnostics, but are prohibitively expensive for large-scale research efforts. The high cost is due to two factors: First, customers are required to sequence large quantities of DNA and RNA to adequately analyze the microbiome; and second, research projects are plagued by long turnaround times due to lower sample throughput. The proposed product will enrich microbial cells and will remove contaminants before the sequencing analysis begins. If successful, the commercial impact of this product for end-users will be substantial cost savings and the ability to expand their customer base, enabling scientific progress to accelerate in microbiome research. Accomplishing the technical aims set forth in this Phase I proposal will significantly reduce technical risk in the company's commercialization efforts by demonstrating proof-of-feasibility for a single-use device and bench-top instrument capable of enriching microbes prior to metagenomic sequencing.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a microbial enrichment tool to significantly reduce the cost and difficulty of analyzing microbiomes using DNA and RNA sequencing.  At present, sequencing laboratory directors only are able to analyze microbiomes at tremendous expense because samples are highly contaminated with DNA and RNA derived from host cells. The proposed solution is a disposable cartridge and a control instrument that will enable lab personnel to rapidly enrich microbes directly from samples without the use of bioengineered tags or labels that introduce bias, and enable the generation of sequencing libraries composed primarily of bacterial DNA and RNA. The technical challenges in this proposal are to convert the current laboratory method for enriching bacteria demonstrated previously into a bench-top instrument that uses a simple and disposable device compatible with current sequencing workflows that requires minimal operator steps. The system's performance in Phase I will be evaluated using spike-in samples with bacterial isolates and mock communities to simulate realistic microbiomes.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project includes the development of new tools and methods for detecting and managing insect populations in the agricultural sector. The benefits of improved information about insect populations are substantial, including increased farm revenues through avoided pest damage and improved pollinator activity, and increased access to export markets by providing information that can be used to demonstrate compliance with the pesticide residue limits and biosecurity requirements of trading partners. On the cost side, this monitoring technology can improve the efficacy and reduce human health impacts of pesticide application through improved targeting of activities. Growers may further avoid labor costs of manual trap inspection and field surveys. Finally, decision support systems built upon this sensing technology can improve the quality of information used to guide farm investment decisions and can be used by crop insurers and financial service providers to deliver more cost-effective services to growers.

    The STTR Phase I proposed project will advance scientific and technological understanding in several areas, including development of optical engineering models to detect the presence of small organisms moving in complex physical environments, advanced signal processing approaches to discern these organisms from non-target objects, and the incorporation of user-driven elements into the design and testing process through collaborations with agricultural producers and crop scientists. Insect monitoring is slow and labor-intensive and uses methods that have changed little in decades. By the time problems are observed, it may be too late for effective management, or the options may be costly. Methods to detect pests and beneficial insects, such as pollinators, must be updated to deal with these realities. This project develops a system to measure distribution of flying insects in challenging agricultural settings such as orchards and vineyards. The instrument will use a patented Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) approach to locate and classify insects in three-dimensional space. The objective of the Phase I project will be to establish the ability of the system to accurately characterize insect behaviors in production agriculture settings, which will allow the improvement and development of new ecological models of insect distributions over space and time.

    This SBIR Phase I project addresses the current unmet need associated with the use of traditional tissue ablation tools in surgical applications. Surgical hand tools, such as saws and drills, inherently injure tissue during ablation through shearing and tearing forces, forcing patients into an arduous recovery path accompanied by risk of surgical site infection. In orthopedic joint replacement surgery, bone and soft tissue injury from hand saws and drills contributes significantly to postoperative joint pain, infection risk, and long-term implant loosening and revision surgery. To improve surgical outcomes for these patients, this SBIR Phase I project aims to develop an entirely innovative tissue ablation system that is comprised of a surgical laser controlled by the first-ever ultra-high speed, or UHS, lens positioning system. The laser system, which employs a wavelength never used in medical applications, reduces the tissue trauma associated with traditional hand tools by leaving healthy, vascularized tissue at each ablation site. The current size of the joint replacement market (>$15 billion annual) positions this technology for a strong commercial future with the potential for thousands of new jobs and sustainable revenues. Successful implementation of the laser system will allow the laser ablation system to be applied across numerous delicate surgical specialties, such as brain and neonatal surgery.

    The key innovation in this SBIR Phase I project is an optical system that provides real-time intraoperative viewing on a 3D monitor, ablative fluence patterns with a new laser wavelength in surgical applications that eliminates tissue necrosis, and instantaneous software-controlled feedback for automatic positional and angular control of the laser beam. In order to enable these capabilities and maximize precision, the all-tissue orthopedic surgical device requires the use of dual ultra-high speed, or UHS, optical systems that operate with microsecond response times to control the new wavelength pulsed in necrosis-free ablative patterns. Because the laser is not in direct contact with the tissue during ablation, as is the case with hand tools, the beam can be susceptible to inadvertent hand movements that direct it off the desired path. The UHS optical system automatically detects any inadvertent movements and stabilizes the laser beam onto the correct ablation pattern in real-time. The high-definition images are also displayed onto a 3-dimensional overhead monitor to allow the surgeon to continuously monitor the ablation in real time. AI software measures the distance and geometrical features of the tissue ablation site as the surgeon is ablating tissue as an additional safeguard against any inaccurate movements.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to overcome the barrier to transparent passive radiative cooling materials that are applicable to commercial environments.  The project develops a transparent passive cooling thin-film applicable to situations that lose efficiency when heated, and where both mechanical and thermal stress are involved, for example, over advertisements on refrigerated trucks, or on the front face of solar panels. It will provide the simultaneous qualities of transparency in visible wavelengths, durability to withstand the elements, flexibility for ease of application, high cooling power to address customers' pain points, and manufacturability in a roll to roll format to minimize costs. The technology has the potential to provide a 25-80% increase in fuel efficiency via application of the thin-film to the outside of refrigerated truck trailers. The benefits to customers include: fuel cost savings, reduced emissions, allowing regulatory requirements to be met, decreased maintenance and replacement costs compared to refrigeration units and in-truck insulation in truck, as well as temperature maintenance in maximum heat.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop a thin-film product that could revolutionize cooling technologies across a number of industries. The demand for temperature-sensitive goods is expected to continue to grow significantly. To address the need for refrigeration with reduced fuel costs and emissions, the project is developing selective photonic emitters in thermal wavelength windows such that instead of heat being effectively enclosed in an insulating thermos (the atmosphere), they are exposed to a vast cold sink of space. The result is a revolutionary method of entirely passive heat management. This approach will be optimized in a thin-film photonics material that provides significant cooling to refrigerated truck trailers, saving refrigeration fuel costs. Phase I research objectives will establish proof of feasibility and include producing and testing promising material combinations at wafer-scale, testing to ensure that the material's qualities transfer to a commercially relevant size, and performing a small-scale test with potential customers.

    a wide variety of settings. However, the use of gait analysis to prevent injury,
    improve mobility and improve patients' lives has been hampered because it is constrained
    to use within medical facilities. The proposed novel sensor system has the ability

    prediction of gait and balance issues in Americans over age 65, about 11.5 million
    of whom fall each year leading to 2.3 million serious injuries; and force data
    which clinicians can correlate to the onset of diabetic foot ulcers, which occur
    in 1.8 million chronic diabetic patients each year. \n\nThis STTR Phase I project
    seeks to develop gait monitor that combines a novel, low-cost, robust and conformable

    more closely approximates gait analysis product requirements. Key goals under
    the STTR Phase I project are to investigate the impact of a range of material
    formulations on normal and shear force measurements, explore how sensor configurations
    affect normal and shear force measurements with a focus on the complexity of signal

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project stems from the need to substantially improve nitrogen (N) use efficiency in crop production and thereby improve profitability for farmers, while simultaneously reducing the adverse effects of agriculture on the environment.  Currently, less than half of the N fertilizer applied to agricultural fields is used by the crops to which it is applied.  The remaining N is either leached from the soil or lost to the atmosphere as nitrous oxide - potent greenhouse gas. This inefficient use of N fertilizer by crops is an economic burden for farmers, cause serious water and air quality problems, and contribute about 2.5% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore, these N losses represent a tremendous energy inefficiency, because the production of synthetic N fertilizer is the largest energy input in production agriculture. The key to improving N use efficiency in crop production is applying the right amount of N fertilizer in the right place at the right time. The proposed sensor technology would be disruptive to existing agricultural technology and practices, wherein N fertilizer is applied at a uniform rate across agricultural fields, and improve profitability for farmers.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to demonstrate the feasibility of a robust field-mobile soil nitrate (NO3-) sensor utilizing mid-infrared technology to facilitate precision N fertilizer applications. Mid-infrared spectrometers have historically been large, expensive, and fragile laboratory instruments that require substantial sample preparation, thus preventing their use as mobile optical soil NO3- sensors. The scope of the Phase I research will focus on three objectives: 1) The design and development of a robust and low-cost mid-infrared spectrometer that uses a diamond attenuated total internal reflectance (D-ATR) probe to measure NO3- levels; 2) The design, construction, and testing of a chisel shank-tool bar system that houses the spectrometer and D-ATR probe; and 3) the development of control and data processing and analysis software to manage the system. Anticipated technical results of Phase I will provide a prototype that can measure NO3- in the upper 30 cm of soil, not just at the surface, by enabling modulation of the depth of the shank and the probe as the system is pulled through a field, and self-cleaning of the system as soil is continuously moved across the optical surface of the diamond by the forward motion of the tractor.

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a hypo allergenic peanut (HAP) variety,
    which is expected to save human lives by preventing allergy-related deaths, reduce
    the incidence of peanut allergy, and increase security, comfort and peace of mind
    for those individuals sensitive to peanuts and their families, extended families,
    friends, schools, and restaurants.  HAP also may reduce and/or eliminate the number
    of institutional lawsuits resulting from peanut allergy events, and reduce and/or
    eliminate the number of costly food recalls due to peanut contaminations. Reducing
    allergens may gain back the loss endured by the peanut market, improve the U.S.
    competitive edge on the international peanut market, and increase sales by 15%
    to 20% due to an increase market by restaurants, airlines and more. Food allergies
    cost the US $25 billion annually and peanut is a major contributor. HAP will provide
    a significant solution to peanut allergy with the potential to reduce the overall
    cost of food allergy.  \n\nThe intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase I project
    is to produce a commercial prototype for a hypoallergenic peanut as a solution
    to the serious health concern nationwide for peanut allergy. In previous work,
    a HAP was developed by concomitant silencing of the genes coding for the three
    most potent peanut allergens Ara h 1, Ara h 2 and Ara h 3. The HAP was 2 to 85-fold
    reduced in allergenic potency, and the HAP trait was transmitted to several successive
    generations in field trials. However, some of the transgenic peanuts were found
    to be chimeric and to produce non-homogeneous population of seeds with variable
    levels of allergenic potency. To solve this problem, repetitive somatic embryogenic
    tissue was used to produce first generation chimera-free HAP (T0 plants). During
    this Phase I project, the progeny T1 plants will be analyzed using Southern blot
    and quantitative PCR to confirm the chimera-free status of the plants. Reverse
    transcriptase quantitative PCR, Western blot, sandwich ELISA and immunoCap assay
    will be performed to confirm the population of the progeny T2 seeds is homogenous
    and has undetectable levels of the targeted allergens. A commercial prototype
    variety for the hypoallergenic peanut will be identified and selected for further
    studies.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy
    of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will result from the development of a traveling-wave parametric amplifier (TWPA) prototype suitable to be marketed to the Quantum Information Processing community. Quantum computers require extremely sensitive amplifiers operating near absolute zero to amplify weak signals. There are two critical features of this amplifier that will benefit the community directly: 1) the ability to have more qubits per amplifier - essential for large scale quantum computers, and 2) the ability to use a commercial manufacturing process. As quantum hardware continues to scale, so does the number of qubits, making multichannel amplifiers essential. European and Asian investment in quantum technology is growing at an alarming rate. The US is at risk of losing the leading position in this technical space. The commercialization of TWPA technology is an example of technologies required for the US to remain competitive in quantum technology.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will introduce a TWPA product prototype for the Quantum Information Processing market by addressing some of the interfacing, packaging and manufacturing limitations of experimental devices. Critical to the ability to distribute these amplifiers to the market is a means of manufacturing such devices at scale. A key advantage of the proposed technology is its ease of fabrication and the fact that it can be fabricated using an industry standard process, which will be demonstrated during the Phase I project.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be realized first in household cleaning applications, a market valued in more than 26 billion/year, where currently only about 3% of the market is filled with eco-friendly alternatives. Cleancult new scrubbing system will allow the development of more efficient and potent cleaning products, capable of competing with traditional petroleum-based brands while helping to reduce the water pollution effects due to laundry/cleaning activities, reduce the appearance of skin conditions in customers due to the continuous exposure to harmful chemicals found in traditional cleaning products, and reduce the energetic cost related to the use of hot water in laundry applications. Cleancult objective is to open the door to novel green clean technologies, by first introducing our all-natural scrubbing system in our products and potentially license the technology to other green detergents manufacturers, and later introduce our own all-natural green surfactant molecule, with the solid intention of increasing the green cleaners? participation in the marker by at least 20% in the next 5 years.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will provide funding for the development of a micellar system(s) composed of a biopolymer particle and a naturally derived from sustainable sources surfactant compound. The conjugation and stabilization mechanism of these micellar systems are the main focus on the research objectives, together with the inclusion of different functionalization to improve oil removal, avoid re-deposition and also enhance the antibacterial properties of the scrubbing system. The complete characterization of the micellar system and its efficacy in removing soil/dirt stains will be achieved through the use of spectroscopic, rheological and hydrodynamic techniques, surface chemistry modifications, and applying the global standards for detergency determination. The research team will work to provide a commercially ready product at the end of this SBIR Phase I project, and due to already in place collaborations with manufacture facilities will avoid delays in the introduction of Cleancults' new line of green powerful cleaners.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is providing a high potent antimicrobial solution for textiles, coatings, polymers, and wound care and bandages. There is considerable proliferation of antibiotic resistant bacteria, and, antimicrobials that do not develop resistance is of significant societal interest. Silver-based antimicrobials are filling this need, and are being used in a variety of medical, consumer and food-related applications. Silver is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial, effective against gram positive, gram negative bacteria (including methicillin-and vancomycin resistant bacteria) as well as fungi, viruses, and biofilms. This has led health care, consumer and food industries to use silver antimicrobial products.  The global market for silver-based powder antimicrobial coatings is currently valued at $910 million and expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.1% until 2020. Concerns however, are increasing about the release of silver and the resulting influence on the environment. Development of high potency silver products using the minimum amount of silver can significantly broaden its use. The benefits of this versatile antimicrobial platform include: 1000-fold increased potency, decreased cost, invisibility and compatibility with formulations.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop and test a highly potent silver-based antimicrobial product. Higher potency is due to control of size of ligand-free AgNP (1-3 nm) anchored to the surface of ~30 nm nanozeolite (NZ), and fast release of Ag+ within the zeolite.  The bactericidal activity of AgNP-NZ has been examined with E. coli (gram negative) and antibiotic resistant MRSA (gram positive), with significant improvement. The potency is further enhanced by modifying the NZ support to introduce multiple features: increased antimicrobial activity via NZ ion-exchanged Zn2+, and surface modification of NZ to enhance interactions with bacteria, including penetration within the bacteria. At the conclusion of this SBIR Phase I project, the product will be ready for further commercialization and marketing by (1) demonstrating the scalability of the synthesis procedure so that there is enough supply of product in the product development process; (2) optimizing synthesis procedure of antimicrobial material according to antimicrobial property, including Ag+ and Zn2+ loading and surface modifications; (3) obtaining third party test reports on optimized samples as objective evidence for marketing and (4) studying the toxicity of the product toward mammalian cells to address toxicity concerns.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to dramatically improve Lithium-Ion Battery
    (LIB) technology in order to advance renewable energy penetration and reduce greenhouse
    gas emissions. LIBs are not only a major component of the current consumer electronics
    industry - they are also becoming a key linchpin in the development of clean energy
    applications such as electric vehicles and grid storage. Their limited cost-competitiveness
    relative to fossil fuels, finite energy density, and limited lifetime are all
    still road blocks against mainstream adoption of these emerging applications.
    These issues all point toward a need for significant technical advancements that
    cannot be satisfied by simple economies of scale alone. Coreshell?s innovation
    is to introduce a cheap and scalable electrode coating technology that protects
    batteries against cycling degradation. The technology has the potential to yield
    a marked improvement in battery cost and performance, as well as a reduction in
    manufacturing rates by replacing a slow electrochemical step that can take days
    with a fast coating step that can be completed within minutes. If fully actualized,
    Coreshell?s coatings have the potential to revolutionize the LIB industry and
    enable widespread commercialization of clean energy technologies. \nThis Small
    Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to demonstrate the effectiveness
    of Coreshell?s unique electrode coating technology. The state-of-the-art electrode
    surface protection in LIBs is formed electrochemically and is termed ?SEI? (Solid-Electrolyte-Interphase).
    SEI is slow and expensive to make, inherently unstable, and consumes lithium thereby
    reducing capacity. This proposal is based on a novel proprietary coating in place
    of SEI, using a roll-to-roll process that can be seamlessly integrated into existing
    LIB manufacturing lines. By depositing well-formed coatings on the surface of
    battery electrodes, Coreshell?s technology can protect against many of the degrading
    reactions that occur during LIB cycling. The proposed technology has the promise
    to deliver greater initial capacity, greater depth-of-charge over equivalent cycle-life,
    reduced manufacturing costs and, ultimately, the potential to reduce LIB cost
    per kWh by up to 25%. In Phase I, Coreshell will demonstrate part of this value
    through two main objectives. The first is to increase initial battery capacity
    by >5% and retain the total capacity to >90% of original after 200 cycles. The
    second is to show that batteries incorporating Coreshell?s coated electrodes can
    eschew SEI formation, which would demonstrate the feasibility of ~7% reduction
    in manufacturing costs.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
    been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual
    merit and broader impacts review criteria."

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will evaluate the technical feasibility and commercial viability of a novel sample preparation method for cryo-EM (cryogenic electron microscopy) studies.  As a rapidly growing technique in the structural biology field, the cryo-EM market as a whole is estimated to be more than $5 billion a year, with > $500 million attributed to the sample preparation space.  In spite of an overall revenue growth rate of more than 70% per year, cryo-EM sample preparation remains an area that has yet to see any major technological breakthroughs commercialized in the past decade.  In fact, the current industry solution is reported to have a failure rate of > 95%.  By providing a sample preparation system that actually works, this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will significantly reshape the massive and rapidly expanding cryo-EM market and allow scientists to more readily collect detailed protein structures in their native state.  This new knowledge on the molecular basis of cells and of life itself will be used to facilitate as well as accelerate the development of new pharmaceuticals as well as therapeutic treatments for diseases and thus greatly benefit human health in the long run.

    The intellectual merit of this project is the development of a cryo-EM sample preparation device built on the application of state-of-the-art microfluidic jet systems to deposit and vitrify protein solution on EM grids in milliseconds, which is at least 1000x faster than the current methods.  Furthermore, it offers scientists the novel ability to control the thickness of the vitrified aqueous layer and, overall, more control over the sample vitrification process.  With this new sample preparation device, a larger region of the cryo-EM grids will have intact protein molecules with the right layer thickness for structural determination, allowing researchers to save time and money in terms of both grid preparation and screening in a high-throughput manner.  Currently, the proposed technology has not been tested nor used anywhere.  Therefore, the first and foremost goal of this SBIR Phase I project is to better understand and well characterize the technical capabilities and limitations of this proposed innovation, with additional R&D work needed before product commercialization, which is expected in five years.  The project will focus on defining and optimizing both the geometric and experimental setup in order to de-risk the technology.

    needed to identify effective antibiotics for urinary tract infections (UTIs) from
    2 days to 2 hours. Every year in the US, 13 million UTIs are treated with a physician's
    best guess antibiotic, because antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) is too
    slow. Up to half of first guesses are wrong, opening up the possibility for infections
    to worsen into life-threatening sepsis and allowing antimicrobial resistance to
    evolve. One quarter of 1.5 million sepsis cases and at least 250,000 deaths every
    year begin as UTIs. Rapid AST using biophysical sensing can take guesswork out
    of UTI treatment, save lives, and avoid billions in unnecessary healthcare costs.
    By sensing bacterial cell fluctuations associated with the mechanically active
    processes of metabolism, motility, and growth, this novel and fundamentally different
    measurement concept for AST enables almost an order of magnitude increase in speed.
    This project will establish technical and commercial feasibility of developing
    the underlying sensor technology for point-of-care diagnostics that demand push-button
    technology operable in a hectic clinical environment. Translating innovative federally-funded
    technologies like this out of the laboratory and into medical clinics will build
    taxpayers' return on basic research investments. \n\nThis project tackles a key
    technical hurdle for clinical implementation of rapid biophysical AST at a meaningful
    scale: demonstration that the demanding performance characteristics of the underlying
    resonating quartz sensor technology can be reproduced using low cost materials
    for a disposable resonator housing providing fluidic, thermal, and electrical
    control.  The rapid biophysical AST method takes the pulse of bacterial cells.
    Changes in mechanical fluctuations of cells occur after exposure to an effective
    antibiotic, and can be sensed in real time by detecting phase noise generated
    by cells on a resonating crystal substrate. Key to the commercial success of this
    technology are multichannel resonators that can be manufactured in large quantities
    to perform with very low noise resonance characteristics. Best practices from
    low cost microfluidics studies will dovetail with those from high-tech resonator
    development to deliver the phase noise performance needed to pick up the biological
    signal. Rapid prototyping tools including 3D printing will be used for quick design
    iterations. If satisfactory, Phase II will optimize fabrication methodologies
    for both resonators and housing modules interfacing with a fully integrated clinical
    prototype instrument ready to support clinical trials of the technology.\n\nThis

    cause more than 440,000 office visits, 130,000 hospital visits, and 17,000 emergency
    room visits each year in the United States. This disorder is addressed by reducing
    spine curve progression through passive brace treatment, which is painful for
    users and does not correct the deformity, and eventually, over one-third of brace
    users stop wearing the brace. To improve use, comfort, and effectiveness of braces
    at halting curve progression, this project will develop a brace that applies corrective
    pressure to the spine to treat AIS with integrated sensors measuring the duration
    of brace use and the corrective forces applied to the spine in real time. This
    sensor will allow parents, patients, and clinicians to monitor compliance; more

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve of aerospace exploration.  In aviation, the capability of the Navigation Relative Positioning System (NIRPS) working with GPS as a reliable interoperable mutual backup system will significantly reduce the need for ground control, hence providing flight safety and the ability to reduce the massive cost of ground support services.  In space applications, NIRPS will significantly improve guidance and control of many space operations, from Low Earth Orbit to Beyond Earth Orbit space missions. It will enhance autonomous rendezvous, improve accuracy of position sensing, and increase the capability of docking without humans in the loop. It will significantly reduce dependence on ground-based tracking, ranging, trajectory/orbit/attitude determination and maneuver planning support functions, and complexity of the flight control algorithms. By continuously holding position information on trajectory, NIRPS will provide programmable capabilities to allow the spacecraft to act independently from ground control, devising real-time actions in response to environmental conditions as well rejecting possible hijacking attempts. NIRPS will enable classes of missions which would not be previously possible.

    The proposed project will address the problems of aerospace navigation by providing onboard reliable real time autonomous cybersecure navigation for aerospace applications. Due to the latency and instability of inertial navigation, aerospace navigation relies on GPS, beacons, and flight/mission control systems. Contrary to inertial navigation utilizing forces of spinning mass or propagation of light inside rotational media, the proposed NIRPS utilizes collinear displacement of the inertial frame in relation to the independent propagation of light within. The Phase I project encompasses the feasibility of deploying photonics methods of fabrication of the NIRPS key component, the Non-Inertial Velocity Detector (NIVD). Silicon photonics is becoming the leading technology for Photonic Integrated Circuits (PICs) due to large-scale integration, low cost, and high-volume production enabled by the Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) fabrication process. In this Phase, we will research materials and their possible interactions in varying environmental conditions.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable the further development of sustainable mobility by developing a new, disruptive class of renewable materials for low-rolling resistance tire tread rubber compound applications. The company will be active not only in materials development and sales, but also in the exploration of new and valuable application areas for energy-efficient renewable materials. The initial target application area is the material used in low-rolling resistance tread compounds for tires currently using petroleum-derived materials, a $5 B market.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will be directed to the technical feasibility of a critical enabling technology supporting the use of renewable elastomers in low-rolling resistance tire applications. Specifically, the innovation will focus on latex-phase nano-scale reinforcement of natural rubber using novel functional silica-based materials. The technical hurdles include translation of the technology from spin-coating of polytetrafluoroethylene nanoemulsion thin films to bulk solids formation from a natural rubber latex. These are significant challenges because the formation mechanisms, required functional groups, and end-use performance requirements are significantly different. Specific challenges include creation of novel functional silica-based materials; uniform dispersion of the materials in a natural rubber (NR) latex; interactions between the material and the phospholipid of the NR latex particle surface; the chemistry and concentration of the functionalization; characterization of the resulting composite polymer and its microstructure; and adaptation and processing of the innovative polymer into a vulcanized rubber tire tread compound with the desired properties.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to greatly advance perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) in terms of efficiency, stability, and readiness for commercialization. The success of the proposed research and development (R&D) activities will ensure a smooth transition from the realization of concepts in Phase I to prototype development of PVSCs on flexible substrates through slot-die coating in SBIR Phase II. Our final products will be mass-produced through low-cost roll-to-roll (R2R) printing and satisfy the customer needs for additional and cheaper electricity. By integrating our high-performance fully flexible solar panels with freight trailers/reefers, freight-truck owners can significantly reduce the diesel fuel consumption (by 30%) and avoid idle run of diesel engine while the drivers are resting. When our products are attached to the military tents, sufficient electricity can be generated to meet electricity needs at forward operating bases (FOBs), thereby significantly relieving the demand for diesel fuel at remote locations and effectively limiting the casualties related to the fuel transportation. In addition to its technical and commercial contribution, this project will impact society by involving and educating the new generation on the PVSCs with a sub-award to The University of Alabama.

    The proposed project will clear the obstacles that currently preventing PVSCs from upscaling manufacture and commercialization. Metal oxides rather than organic materials as charge transport layers have been demonstrated to enhance both device performance and stability. However, high quality metal-oxide films require high thermal annealing temperatures and long annealing time, which will destroy both flexible substrates and perovskite absorber layer.  Photonic irradiation will be employed to achieve rapid and layer-specific annealing for both metal-oxide hole transport layer (HTL) and metal-oxide electron transport layer (ETL) without damaging other layers in PVSCs. Moreover, the rapid layer-specific photonic annealing happens in seconds, which is fully compatible with the R2R printing. With compositional engineering, the perovskite absorber layer will also go through rapid photonic treatment. The resulted PVSCs will be able to achieve PCE over 25% with long-term stability and pave the way for large-scale manufacturing of PVSCs through high-speed printing. The proposed highly-selective photonic treatment for each stacking layer in HTL/Perovskite/ETL sandwich structure provides the solution to achieve stabilized PVSCs with efficiency over 25%.

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase I project will develop a machine learning-assisted
    family math preparation program that will help and encourage parents to provide
    early math instruction to young children, ages 4-8. Along with reading, developing
    mathematical proficiency is arguably one of the most important skills for young
    children to acquire, particularly with the growing importance of STEM (science,
    technology, engineering, and math) in the world today. Yet standardized test scores
    in math remain alarmingly low, with just 40% of US fourth grade students performing
    at grade level. A considerable body of research now shows that these gaps often
    appear before a child first enters kindergarten. Strong parental engagement in
    a child's mathematics learning is often cited as a key indicator of future academic
    success, but ways to bring about this engagement remain elusive. Grounded both
    in computational social science and constructivist models of learning, this project
    aims to develop a scaleable means of targeting parental engagement and promoting
    positive math learning experiences for families, goals which are fundamentally
    aligned with NSF's mission to promote the progress of science and advance national
    welfare, and which could have significant social and economic impact for years
    to come. \n\n\nThis project will introduce several innovations, particularly in
    the areas of artificial intelligence and data modeling. A mobile learning application
    will be developed that provides users with a range of on- and off-screen math
    activities for parent and child to engage in together. Data will be collected
    from short surveys repeated at regular intervals and these will be collated together
    with information provided by the app (learning data, time-on-task, etc.). Deep
    learning approaches will be leveraged to explore relationships between content,
    engagement, and learning measures and to suggest follow-on activities predicted
    to improve these outcomes. While the data set will be limited during Phase I research,
    the technology will be able to identify an increasing number of connections as
    participation becomes more and more robust over time. In Phase II, these and other
    instruments will describe and detect family engagement practices at more than
    just one point in time, with differing socio-economic groups, and in a variety
    of different geographies.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has

    The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of accurate, fast, miniaturized and low-cost gas sensors that are suitable for integration into internet of things (IoT) devices. Successful commercial implementation of the proposed sensors would broadly benefit society. IoT devices incorporating those sensors such as smartphones and wearables can directly help 10 million asthma patients in the US and billions of air pollutant vulnerable people worldwide. These devices enhance safety by detecting dangerous conditions such as a gas leak or gas build-up in a utility, industrial plant or transportation facility. Sharing information across networks of IoT devices provides more accurate temporal and spatial gas information, promoting public safety by making the information available to emergency response and regulatory enforcement personnel. The competitive advantages of the proposed sensor over other gas sensor technologies can be transformed into commercial success by filling the market vacancy into previously inaccessible devices like smartphones. Resulting project activities would also benefit science, education and local communities by advancing the research frontier on electrochemistry and nurturing cross-disciplinary entrepreneurship with IoT applications.

    The proposed project brings together state-of-the-art microfabrication methods and the most recent developments of electrochemical gas sensing technology to reinvent the traditional electrochemical gas sensor. The Phase I feasibility research focuses on overcoming the unmet challenges of electrochemical gas sensor miniaturization and liquid electrolyte handling in microfabrication processes.  An innovative microfabricated structure is proposed using semiconductor-compatible manufacturing processes. Sensor stability is proposed to be studied in the context of the electrode-electrolyte interface, a not well understood area. The proposed microfabricated structures bring a new quantitative perspective to the electrode-electrolyte interface study and may generate new knowledge on fundamentals to help improve sensor performance. The proposed research activity is expected to achieve a carbon monoxide sensor of 2x2x0.5mm form factor that consumes sub micro amps of current, demonstrated by an IoT sensor network platform. In Phase II, sensors of more gases, including ozone, nitric oxide, methane, etc. will be implemented on a complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) integrated circuit (IC) containing potentiostats and a data converter through post-CMOS microfabrication processes.

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project will result from the development of a scalable
    and predictive software platform with a remote monitoring service that analyzes
    patient blood pressure data and delivers clinical recommendations, enabling healthcare
    providers to triage patients before their hypertension devolves into heart attack
    and stroke, and shortening the interval to achieve blood pressure control from
    the standard of care (18 to 24 months) to as little as 10 weeks. This model is
    beneficial on a societal level because the hypertension epidemic affects 1 in
    3 adults in the United States, creating financial and quality of life burdens
    on more than 100 million people and costs the healthcare system $131 billion annually.
    On a business and financial level, the model's prevention of adverse healthcare
    events will result in major cost savings for healthcare providers, insurers, and
    public health authorities. High blood pressure affects 40% of adults over 25 globally,
    and is a major factor in cardiovascular disease, the number one worldwide cause
    of death, which occurs primarily in developing countries. Preventing and predicting
    high blood pressure will transform how chronic diseases are treated around the
    world. \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims
    to develop an algorithmic model to predict malignant hypertension physiology.
    Pharmacology-based blood pressure prediction has been demonstrated in small studies
    of continuous 24-hour blood pressure monitoring but has not been translated to
    point-of-care mobile management in the outpatient setting. Developing a model
    of pharmacology-based blood pressure prediction using blood pressure variability,
    rate of progression, and deviation from pharmacologic baseline that portends heart
    attack and stroke is critical to point-of-care mobile management for hypertension.
    Moreover, predictive analytics based on contextual data related to patient physiology
    has not yet been developed. This Phase 1 project applies existing algorithmic
    modeling to hypertension management by collecting unique data from hypertensive
    patients including daily physiological data collected from wearable blood pressure
    devices, pharmacology data derived from tracking medication adherence and time
    of medication consumption, contextual data including diet, exercise and sleep,
    and patients' clinical records, to develop a predictive model that alerts clinicians
    when patients' blood pressure is trending towards a negative health event. This
    predictive model will incur minimal cost and structural changes to existing healthcare
    infrastructure while reducing hospitalizations, generating massive cost savings
    for providers, and significantly improving patient outcomes.\n\nThis award reflects

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop field-deployable chemical sensors capable of measuring and quantifying atmospheric volatile molecules on a wide scale and at low cost. This project is initially intended for operators in the natural gas business (producers and utilities), by gearing this network towards detecting gas leaks. However, the lack of continuous atmospheric monitoring solutions is an issue in many verticals including but not limited to mining, agriculture, manufacturing, and others. Creating such a platform will allow for us to develop solutions beyond natural gas utilities and producers. These solutions will allow us to create industry standards for continuous monitoring in many fields. This work will not only lead to important technological innovations, including the first fully gas-phase electrochemical measurements, but also broadly impact society economically, environmentally, and through its impact on the health of average citizens.

    The SBIR Phase I proposed project builds upon our voltammetric sensing proof of concept to increase its technology readiness level from lab-ready to field-ready. This change will allow these sensors to be used as part of a continuous emissions monitoring system. There are currently no low cost chemical sensors that can produce high quality data by identifying and quantifying various volatile molecules in air. Field-deployment of these sensors will be possible by integrating temperature and humidity compensation, adding the ability to operate without hydration, and improving the sensing resolution. Furthermore, the company will focus on using a higher throughput fabrication process like inkjet printing, to allow their sensors to be compatible with roll-to-roll manufacturing processes. The combination of these features will lead to sensors that can be robustly deployed and operated in different geographies and weather patterns.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is that it will revolutionize AC-DC convertors that are present in nearly all existing and future residential and commercial electronic devices.  Reduced convertor complexity and increased power efficiency will result in extreme cost savings for both the manufacturers of these devices as well as the end consumers, enabling adoption to all corners of society.  This dramatically different integrated convertor will also bring powerline communications into these electronic devices, a game changer that will enable electronics developers to add intelligence to their products across numerous markets such as home and office IoT devices, AC powered medium-wattage (~5W) electronics, power-over-ethernet, and smart LED lighting.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will create an alternative integrated AC-DC converter architecture.  Existing converters have numerous bulky, expensive, and unreliable discrete magnetic components that will be replaced with this integrated circuit (IC) based solution.  The result of this project will be a reduced footprint, reduced BOM count, efficient converter for medium wattage (~5W) electronic loads.  This project will additionally support low wattage loads (<1W) with an even smaller footprint and even lower BOM count, showcasing the scalability of this technology which is not an option with existing fly-back AC-DC convertor solutions.  Validation of the Phase I IC-based converter performance will provide a foundation for Phase II, and incorporation into powerline communications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to introduce a novel form of ultralight wearable cooling technology.  Excess weight is a key limitation of active wearable cooling technology today, restricting its adoption.  In contrast, active indoor heating and cooling, where solutions are stationary and the weight is relatively unimportant, is a multi-billion dollar market.  Significant unmet demand exists for lightweight active cooling that can work outdoors as well.  The proposed wearable cooling technology would improve performance and comfort while reducing the risk of dehydration and heat stroke.  Users who can benefit range from specialty applications to recreational uses.  For example, military personnel who are active in hot climates while wearing body armor and struggling to stay hydrated is one specialty application.  Other specialty applications include welders wearing protective gear in hot environments.  Here, extending work times, improving comfort and thus reducing errors would boost productivity.  Endurance athletes could also benefit from faster times during events of multiple hours in hot climates.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will address the need for a state-of-the-art Droplet Transmission Technology (DTT) for Ultralight Wearable Cooling System (UWCS) to achieve a flexible, ultralight cooling technology that allows longer-lasting, powerful cooling capabilities for the end-user. The proposed activity will demonstrate DTT, a novel transport phenomenon.  DTT enables a unique way to manage and generate cooling from two-phase flows. The design of channels utilized in the product and their dimensions will be studied using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models and tested via 3D printing of the experimental prototypes. The final UWCS design for the full torso prototype will be integrated and the cooling capabilities verified using a thermal manikin.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to introduce a fully integrated current sensor with an order of magnitude performance improvement over state-of-the-art technologies. The developed technology will enable more reliable, efficient and compact power electronics systems. Power electronics is an integral part of today's power delivery systems such as renewable energy systems, electric vehicles, data centers and most consumer electronics. In these applications, electric current information is often an essential parameter that needs to be known and measured for control, diagnostic and prognostic purposes. With advances in power electronic circuits with specific attention to high frequency power converters, there is a need to investigate alternative approaches and techniques to measure the current. These approaches should result in availability of current sensors that have fast-response, are accurate, loss-less, and preferably non-intrusive. The impact of such a sensor is to enable systems and circuits that will be miniaturized and be made more efficient by using wide bandgap semiconductors and high switching frequencies. Additionally, the availability of current measurement information will lead to greater reliability and prognostic capability. Applications include but are not limited to power converters in electric vehicles and data centers.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project seeks to demonstrate the feasibility of a novel contactless, hybrid current sensor offering an order of magnitude better performance than the state-of-the-art in capturing currents up to and beyond 30 MHz for use in emerging high-frequency power converter applications utilizing wide bandgap semiconductors. The proposed sensor combines complementary magnetoresisor and Rogowski coil technology along with magnetic concentrators into a single chip. By combining these previously underexplored technologies in discrete current sensing would result in a non-invasive, lossless current sensor for MHz converters, where today none exists. Phase I objectives will address technical challenges in developing a chip-scale integrated sensor, including miniaturized Rogowski coil design and magnetic concentrator shape and material evaluation for signal amplification and electromagnetic interference rejection. Design of the analog signal conditioning circuits required for the integrated circuits are also part of this phase.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project involves improving oil and gas sustainability.  To achieve that goal, we are proposing purifying produced water at the wellsite using waste natural gas to reduce disposal costs, carbon footprint and human induced seismicity from disposal wells. This process is enabled by patented equipment that fundamentally changes thermal distillation by performing the entire process inside a heat exchanger to reduce equipment and energy costs.   In Texas, using the amount of gas that is flared annually, the proposed X-VAPTM system can theoretically purify a significant percentage of U.S. produced water problem of 33 billion barrels in 2020.  The brine discharge from the purification process will be concentrated into specific densities to be recycled as a drilling fluid.  This new circular economy will provide environmental benefits by reducing the need for large diesel water trucks to move the source water, dispose the produced water and deliver heavy brine for drilling.  Society will benefit with a new renewable source of fresh water and reduce the need for oil and gas producers to compete with farmers and ranchers for increasingly scarce fresh water resources.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to prove the X-VAPTM thermal distillation system can fundamentally improve thermal distillation by reducing equipment costs and energy requirements.  Before this patented invention, the entire thermal distillation including the distillation and separation from contaminates has never been performed inside a heat exchanger. The unique design provides a removable spring water tray and distillation column to address maintenance issues including scaling in the field.  Our team of industry-experienced engineers will further test, improve and validate the existing thermal distillation prototype by performing prototype lab experiments and coordinated simulations to calibrate and improve equipment designs (Phase I).  These novel simulations will need to be calibrated against coordinated prototype laboratory tests to achieve a 90% agreement between simulations and laboratory tests.  This testing data and correlated simulations will be utilized to scale the prototype design to efficiently handle large volumes of produced water typically encountered at oil and gas well sites.  The proposed research and simulation testing will validate the patented system and create a proposed program for customer field testing prior to commercialization (Phase II).

    Research (SBIR/STTR) Phase I project is to commercialize the world?s first sunscreen
    that protects against UVA-induced photoaging, provides sufficient UVB protection
    and to reverse UVB-induced damage, and is safe to coral reefs. Leading sunscreens
    that are currently on the market have been shown to be inadequate in protection
    against UVA damage (photoaging). Moreover, Oxybenzone and octinoxate, which are
    found in over 80% of chemical sunscreens, have been shown to be highly toxic to
    coral cells. Estimated 14,000 tons of sunscreen settle into the world?s coral
    reefs every year and the oxybenzone that is present in many of these sunscreens
    cause coral bleaching and accelerate the destruction of the world?s already fragile
    coral reefs. The Magic Blue sunscreen uses an alternative eco-friendly technology
    to protect the skin from UVA and UVB damage, and the successful commercialization/market
    adoption of the Magic Blue sunscreen will significantly benefit the global environment
    by protecting our aquatic ecosystems, especially coral reefs, from further oxybenzone/octinoxate-induced

    Research (SBIR) project is to develop technology that will enable robust, contamination-free,
    continuous biomanufacturing.  While biomanufacturing may be one of the most technologically
    complex and profitable industries, the underlying production process, batch fermentation,
    has not changed in decades. In theory, continuous fermentation would decrease
    operational cost and increase production capacity.  However, owing to the high
    risk of contamination, continuous fermentation is considered unreliable and is
    rarely used. The proposed technology solves this issue and enables contamination-free,
    continuous fermentation. Successful implementation of continuous fermentation
    facilitates automated production and paves the way for future technological development
    in continuous product purification and recovery. The reduced operational cost
    is essential for the economic viability of bio-based commodity chemicals such
    as bioplastics, as their market demand depends primarily on their price competitiveness
    with petroleum-derived counterparts. The proposed technology also eliminates the
    use of antibiotics in fermentation, which in turn alleviates antibiotic misuse
    and promotes a positive environmental and health impact. \n\nThe intellectual
    merit of this SBIR Phase I project is to explore the feasibility of using a biocide/biocide-resistant
    system to prevent and treat microbial contamination during continuous biomanufacturing.
    Microbial contamination in biomanufacturing processes is a major concern, as it
    results in loss of productivity, time, and money.  In addition, it restricts the
    production mode to slow batch fermentation, and prohibits the implementation of
    continuous fermentation. The proposed technology solves the contamination problem,
    as a biocide will inhibit the invading microbial and viral contaminants and a
    biocide-resistant enzyme will protect the processing hosts. The proposed Phase
    I research will address the technical challenges by using classical molecular
    biology and synthetic biology techniques. The first objective is to demonstrate
    that the proposed technology will provide biocide resistance to bioplastics-producing
    organisms while inhibiting the outgrowth of contaminants. The second objective
    is to show that the proposed technology can be used to prevent and treat contamination
    in continuous fermenters. The final objective is to fine-tune the biocide/biocide-resistant
    system to demonstrate the technology will not adversely affect the production
    yield and product quality in continuous fermenters. If successful, future Phase
    II development will be conducted in pilot and industrial-scale reactors to further
    optimize the technology.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project will address a critical bottleneck to widespread
    advanced material use in commercial markets.  Carbon nanotubes are advanced supermaterials
    that have been at the forefront of technological innovation since their discovery
    in the early 1990s, but limited commercial success has ensued due to their high
    cost of production.  Current use of carbon nanotube materials is limited to a
    few industries capable of absorbing the high cost of research-scale quantities
    of carbon nanotubes (defense applications, aerospace manufacturers, and research
    institutions). Achieving scalable, lower-cost carbon nanotube manufacturing processes
    will enable widespread applications such as: advanced batteries with lower cost,
    weight, and improved longevity, tires with longer lifetimes and increased fuel
    efficiency, and coatings enabling enhanced functionality such as in the case of
    de-icing for aircrafts, spacecraft vehicles, and drones.  The societal impact
    of this advancement includes better performing and more energy efficient devices
    for consumers without added cost.  The commercial impact of this technology will
    enable the significant effort carried out in many market sectors to evaluate and
    understand the benefit of carbon nanotubes to products, to be economically realized.
    \   \n\n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will
    develop a novel electrochemical liquid-phase growth method for carbon nanotube
    production, which significantly lowers the cost of production for carbon nanotubes
    and enables widespread commercial use of the materials.  The largest bottleneck
    to carbon nanotube utilization today is the high production cost that arises due
    to numerous factors including low efficiency of chemical processes, high overhead
    cost for scaling, and formation of toxic by-products that require additional costs.
    \ These limitations have led to high prices for the materials that prohibit their
    use in cost-sensitive markets, which rely on low-cost additives such as carbon
    black.  The research objectives of this SBIR project will demonstrate feasibility
    of using a scalable catalyst preparation and deposition technique for the production
    of carbon nanotubes through low-cost, environmentally-beneficial electrochemical
    routes.  To achieve this, we will utilize ambient processing for catalyst preparation
    and a scalable electrochemical reaction chamber that harnesses the precision of
    electrochemistry, sources the carbon feedstock directly from air, and operates
    at extremely high energy efficiencies (>90%).  The anticipated technical results
    include a rapid and scalable growth technique with minimized added cost from catalyst
    deposition without compromising carbon nanotube quality.\n\nThis award reflects

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to engineer resistance to two bacterial diseases
    in citrus trees, Huanglongbing (HLB) and citrus canker.  HLB and canker have cost
    growers billions of dollars in destroyed trees and are decimating the Florida
    citrus industry. In Florida, annual citrus production has fallen from 242 million
    boxes in the 2003-2004 growing season to 45 million boxes in 2017-2018.  Further,
    citrus canker may be found in 98% of the citrus production regions in Florida.
    Working with the University of Florida, the goal of this project is to use CRISPR/Cas9
    gene editing to advance natural selection to make citrus trees resistant to both
    HLB and citrus canker. If successful, this approach could be used to protect the
    93 million tons of citrus production worldwide. \n\nThe intellectual merit of
    this SBIR project is to develop HLB and canker-resistant citrus varieties by using
    gene editing with CRISPR/Cas9. Florida citrus growers need a solution to these
    diseases, and producing a genetically-resistant citrus variety is a promising
    strategy. The approach is to modify plant genes that are the targets of proteins
    secreted by the disease-causing bacteria. The first objective is to conduct the
    gene editing in commercially viable citrus varieties. This will be accomplished
    non-transgenically by transforming a non-integrated plasmid or purified Cas9 protein
    and in vitro transcribed sgRNA in citrus protoplasts. To identify gene edits,
    protoplasts will be grown into callus, which will be screened by PCR and DNA heteroduplex
    digestion as well as Sanger and/or high-throughput sequencing. The second objective
    will be to take plants with confirmed edits, clonally propagate them, and conduct
    preliminary testing for HLB or canker resistance. Plants will be inoculated with
    the disease-causing bacteria and then monitored for disease progression by observation
    of physical characteristics and measurement of bacterial titers by PCR. The best
    performing mutations from Phase I will be combined and used for more extensive
    greenhouse and field testing during SBIR Phase II.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's

    by months without using preservatives, chemicals, freezing, or refrigeration.
    \ The technology would enable: all-natural, shelf stable fruit and vegetable products
    that retain maximum nutritional value, texture, and taste.  With significant percentages
    of the total US national energy budget used for food-related energy, and high
    fresh produce loss in the developed countries due to insufficient refrigeration,
    achieving shelf life extension without cold storage or preservatives could drastically
    reduce energy costs, increase efficiency, and expand access to nutrition globally.
    \n\nThis STTR Phase I project proposes to develop, validate, and build-upon initial
    research to evaluate the feasibility and scope of a novel food processing technology.
    Traditional processing methodologies have fundamental drawbacks.  High temperature
    treatments degrade nutritional quality while altering texture and taste of end-products.
    Freezing negatively affects the reconstitution properties of fruits and vegetables,
    and requires high energy consumption throughout the food system to maintain the
    cold chain.  HPP (high pressure processing) has limitations on the enzymes it
    can inactivate, and chemical alterations from high pressure treatment negatively
    affects texture and taste.  This research proposal will use validation studies
    to evaluate the feasibility and applicability of the novel processing technique
    to a variety of fruits and vegetables.  Successful experimentation will prove
    that the application of dense phase gas at low temperatures can overcome the aforementioned
    drawbacks, achieving enzymatic inactivation, destruction of the spores, improved
    reconstitution properties, lower energy requirements, and minimal deterioration

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will result from the development of a scalable, enterprise-ready conversational AI platform that enables businesses to automate customer support requests, optimize call routing efforts to get customers to the right human support agent, generate customer self-service resources like smart FAQs, augment human staff with bot capabilities, and enable personalized recommendations to support sales and purchasing decisions for customers. Such technology is beneficial to any enterprise organization, B2C (business-to-consumer) and B2B (business-to-business), who needs to communicate to customers, employees, and the public. With rising customer service and communication costs, automation is critical for businesses to maintain profitability and competitive advantages. On a societal level, conversational interfaces democratize access to information and resources worldwide. A significant portion of the world's population lives in regions where internet access is poor and device ownership is rare. Many also suffer from physical limitations, such as impaired vision or limited motor control. Accelerating technology access through conversational interfaces such as SMS and voice has already been shown to transform quality of life for disadvantaged groups through applications in telemedicine, personal finance, and education.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to enable human-level conversational ability in machines. Teaching computers to communicate like humans is a critical step to achieving human-level machine intelligence (HLMI), also called artificial general intelligence (AGI). Current state-of-the-art approaches to automated dialog systems use a combination of supervised learning and reinforcement learning implemented with deep neural network architectures. These approaches have shown promise on toy problems in academic research, but have mixed performance in enterprise settings. This Phase 1 project extends current deep learning approaches by developing a repeatable methodology for annotating and preparing enterprise data for use in dialog systems and a scalable, grounded neural network architecture that can reference external knowledge sources with minimal manual engineering.

    average hospital's operating revenues. As hospitals adapt to a rapidly changing
    healthcare market, hospital management often seek to reduce staffing costs to
    increase operational viability. These cost-cutting initiatives introduce significant
    risk exposure, with studies showing that staffing a unit below the target level
    is associated with increased mortality and other adverse patient events. Inadequate
    staffing causes staff to feel overworked and leads to burnout, which costs hospitals
    over $9 billion annually, in part because of turnover. Optimizing clinical workforce
    staffing is especially critical in the emergency department, which must provide
    on-demand availability of staff to meet the needs of rapidly changing patient
    populations without significant delay. With nearly half of all medical care in
    the United States occurring in emergency departments and visits to the emergency
    department increasing 44% over the past decade, it is essential for U.S. public
    health to optimize emergency department staffing to ensure quality patient care
    and clinical outcomes, while also delivering better financial performance. No
    comprehensive technology exists for optimizing emergency department staffing decisions.
    \n\n\nThis SBIR Phase I project will be used to: i) develop an automated emergency
    department patient demand predictive engine and create a software platform that
    automates the predictive model recalibration process; ii) develop a staff flexing
    recommender and decision support engine, which allows for user input and clinical
    judgment before a final staffing decisions is made, iii) integrate the recommender
    engine with real-time patient volume feed, and iv) develop human-centered design
    interface for the decision support engine that is appropriate for the dynamic
    clinical setting of the emergency department. The engine and its user interface
    will be developed in collaboration with three beta sites. Upon successful completion
    of the project, the engine will be used for cost-benefit analysis of data driven
    staffing decision making at the proposed beta sites.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project will result from the development of a next-generation
    product that will revolutionize COPD management by empowering patients, providers
    and caregivers to monitor the disease, prevent respiratory attacks, and receive
    timely care at home. Currently, COPD kills one American every four minutes and
    costs nearly $72B a year - almost half of that cost is attributable to ER visits
    and hospitalization. Projected benefits include early detection of lung deterioration,
    which will facilitate preventive interventions at home and thereby reduce the
    $36B/year spent on ER and hospital visits. A recent CMS regulatory change (CMS-1689-FC)
    permits reimbursements for remote monitoring of COPD patients, indicating market
    readiness by recognizing the success of remote monitoring in reducing admissions
    and long-term acute care use. Our solution has a validated business model (through
    over 220 I-Corps customer interviews) that drives value for patients, physicians,
    provider networks and payers. Successful development of this product is forecast
    to create 42 new jobs (2024) with an annual payroll exceeding $6.5M. As a direct
    result of this award, this innovative product can reach the U.S. market in 2023,
    with $100M in projected revenue by 2027.  \n \nThis Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a new gold-standard for detecting
    COPD deterioration. The product is based on low-cost audio sensors paired with
    AI algorithms on a Smartphone platform that track lung resonance and flag any
    changes in lung volume. Current methods for tracking lung function at home are
    sub-optimal. Home spirometers are difficult to use, and not reimbursable. Pulse-oximeters
    are highly inaccurate and only provide data at discrete points, leading to late
    diagnosis. This lack of timely information manifests in excess hospitalizations
    because detection often occurs too late to prevent an attack. This product creates
    a fundamental shift in the technology employed at home by identifying air trapping,
    a more sensitive biomarker for lung deterioration. The novelty is affirmed with
    two pending patent applications and a freedom to operate analysis that found no
    prior art of concern. Currently lung resonance measurement is not used in other
    respiratory monitoring devices, providing the company with a strong competitive
    differentiation. The goal of this project is to create a Minimum Viable Product
    that can be used for human testing. By the end of this award the company will
    test and validate the concept in a small cohort of patients and controls.\n\nThis
    award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
    evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to improve law enforcement (LE) effectiveness in battling the illegal drug epidemic in the U.S. Death rates related to drug use have been increasing yearly and exceeded 72,000 Americans in 2017. To control this epidemic, the President?s 2019 Budget Request called for $30B in federal funding to combat illegal drug use, presenting a commercial opportunity to disrupt the existing market for conventional color test kits and Raman-based testing systems. Numerous interviews conducted with LE and forensic supply resellers demonstrate a readiness to adopt a new technology to replace drug test kits currently in use. This novel drug test system will improve the accuracy, reliability, ease of use, safety, and affordability of field drug identification and permit field use data analysis, which will help remove dangerous drugs from the streets. This innovation will also enhance the understanding of the chemical and photoluminescent properties of narcotic drugs reacting with various drug-indicator materials such as copper(I) iodide and validate the use of such information to identify suspected drugs. This is a wireless technology for the LE market sector, with the potential to eventually expand into the medical diagnostics and environmental analysis markets.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a novel system for on-site field drug testing for LE. Conventional chemical-based color tests are outdated and highly flawed, causing issues for end users and the rest of the drug enforcement ecosystem. These issues include false positive drug tests and the lack of ability to identify new drugs that are introduced into U.S. communities each year. Superior testing methods such as handheld Raman devices are too expensive for LE agencies to widely adopt, thus a low-cost technologically-innovative solution is necessary. This innovation leverages photoluminescence spectroscopy in four main components: a handheld spectrometer, a drug-sampling device, a mobile app with a matching algorithm and access to a cloud database of reference drug standards. The goal of this phase I project is to achieve a high-fidelity Minimum Viable Product drug testing system. The investigation of alternative fluorescent drug-indicators is anticipated to result in novel methods for drug identification with high selectivity and sensitivity. These methods will be implemented into a drug-sampling device. As a part of software and hardware optimization, beta testers within LE will help identify system shortcomings and provide input to develop enhancements for usability and ergonomics.

    This SBIR Phase I project supports development of an innovative device for use in laparoscopy (minimally invasive surgery of the abdomen). Laparoscopic injuries most often occur during primary port entry, before visualization into the abdominal cavity is possible. Injuries are primarily to the bowel or vasculature and are very serious, with mortality rates up to 5% for bowel injuries and up to 15% for vascular injuries. To minimize this risk, surgeons lift the abdominal wall away from the vital organs that could be inadvertently punctured during primary port entry. Two lifting techniques are commonly utilized, but one is unreliable and the other invasive. The product in development utilizes suction instead of mechanical force to grasp the abdominal wall and is more reliable and less invasive than the current techniques. Projected benefits include better surgical outcomes, increased surgeon and patient satisfaction, and decreased patient post-op pain. Successful development of this product is forecasted to create 40 new jobs by 2023 with an annual payroll exceeding $2.5M. As a direct result of this Phase I grant, this innovative product can reach the U.S. market in 2019 and become the gold standard for abdominal wall lifting devices in the next five years.

    The technical innovation in this proposed project is a novel abdominal lifting device for use in laparoscopic surgery that is more reliable and less invasive than current lifting techniques. The novelty of the innovation is affirmed with one issued patent and an additional pending patent application. The device takes advantage of existing suction available in every operating room.  This suction allows for the non-invasive attachment of the lifting device to the abdominal wall.  Current lifting techniques include manually grasping the abdominal wall and using perforating towel clips. Manual grasp does not always provide a secure grip and perforating towel clips invasively perforate abdominal wall tissue to provide a handle by which to lift and elevate. The technical goals of this project focus on creating a minimum viable product produced with biocompatible materials using standard good manufacturing practices for FDA Class I medical devices. Production quality samples will be produced with five different materials to determine which performs best in terms of strength, reliability, and flexibility. These samples will also be used to determine if any further design changes are needed prior to commercialization.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project lies in the increase in efficiency and reduction in cost of gathering information in surface water environments using unmanned surface vehicles (USVs). USVs have the potential to increase accessibility to bodies of water, enhance coverage, and make data collection safer by removing humans from the task. However, to fully realize the potential of USVs for gathering information, a level of autonomy with minimal need for human supervision and intervention is required. The development of this technology will open the door to the pervasive use of USVs for environmental data collection, and ultimately benefit society through: i) more information upon which to base decisions about resource management and environmental policy; ii) higher frequency of data collection activities through reduced cost; and iii) increased safety by keeping human personnel out of harsh environments.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will lay the foundation for a transformative approach to environmental data collection in surface waters. The intellectual merit of this project lies in addressing technical challenges that will enable unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) to effectively navigate autonomously in complex surface waters that may contain a range of diverse obstacles, which would otherwise be inaccessible or at best require a high degree of human supervision. This will be achieved by advancing the state-of-the-art in computer vision and machine learning toward intelligent obstacle characterization. The proposed framework interprets images or video of obstacles to extract salient features, such as flexibility or rigidity, through the innovative use of machine learning, dimensionality reduction, and tools borrowed from the analysis of collective behavior. This extra layer of information provided through the proposed framework represents a significant advancement in computer vision, which offers direct benefits to environmental monitoring and data collection by empowering USVs with new unmanned capabilities.

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase I project focuses on developing chemically cross-linked
    synthetic nanomaterials to address the unmet clinical need in promoting infection
    free tissue regeneration in surgical, traumatic, ocular, burn, and chronic wounds.
    While small wounds heal naturally, larger chronic wounds demonstrate delayed wound
    healing with infections, and affect over 6.5 million patients costing over US
    $25 billion annually in treatments. In addition, annually, 2 million Americans
    suffer from serious infections due to drug resistant bacteria resulting in severe
    morbidity, serious complications, huge economic losses with an estimated 23,000
    deaths. As conventional antibiotics are failing, our ability to fight drug resistant
    pathogens is diminishing and the pipeline of new potential antibiotic drugs is
    very skim. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop a product that can fight multiple
    pathogens through a mechanism against which bacteria are less likely to develop
    further resistance. Hence, the current project evaluates the feasibility of developing
    a novel, easily handleable dry film with potential to eliminate a variety of infectious
    pathogens while improving wound healing in a single application. This product
    is pliable, easily rehydratable, has intrinsic tissue scaffolding properties and
    is inherently antimicrobial against a broad range of pathogens without the use
    of any additional agents.  \n \nThis SBIR Phase I project will demonstrate the
    feasibility of developing a shape retaining, pliable, easily handleable antimicrobial
    cell-scaffolding gel matrix into a product that is simultaneously toxic to antibiotic-resistant
    bacterial strains, while remaining conducive to tissue regeneration. This current
    product has a nano-porous gel matrix that promotes cellular infiltration and attachment
    along with utilizing a charge-based mechanism to lyse bacterial membranes upon
    contact. Although there is on-going research on such self-assembled hydrogels,
    the formation of films using these nanofibers has never been assessed before and
    stands to be the key technological advancement. Thus, this current proposal explores
    two methods for making films such as i) solvent casting methods relying on non-covalent
    crosslinking - where the hydrogel is applied to a surface and then allowed to
    dry into a film overnight, and ii) Covalent crosslinking by - incorporating cysteines
    by oxidizing using H2O2 or crosslinking using Schiff base formation followed by
    reductive deamination. The films so formed will be structurally and functionally
    evaluated for their ability to eliminate infections and biocompatibility.\n\nThis

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to address the global challenge of pollution abatement and air purification which have a profound impact on the environment, health, and economy. Hundreds of billions of dollars are spent each year on emission control activities, yet air pollution costs the global economy over five trillion of dollars annually in welfare costs and is attributed to one in every eight deaths. The design and performance of current industrial catalytic air purification technologies is insufficient to treat the growing number of airborne pollutants. Finding sustainable, cost-effective solutions to this problem, and is becoming increasingly important in view of tightening regulations. The technology we propose has a high commercialization potential due to the fact that it is cost-effective, shows excellent long-term performance and potential for scalable fabrication within an existing manufacturing framework within the United States.  Further, the founders of the company are inventors of the technology and have exclusive licensing of the core IP. Significantly, our demonstration of operating temperature reductions has been well-received by industry as evidenced by findings from our customer discovery effort through programs such as NSF I-Corps.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses outstanding challenges in catalytic converters, notably technical challenges associated with cold start, durability, and high cost, which can be attributed to the use of substantial amounts of platinum group metals, and reliance on the limited reserves of these metals. Through highly controlled composition and nano-, micro-, and macro- structuration, we have previously demonstrated dramatically reduced precious metal content in a catalytic decomposition of known pollutants. The research objectives of this SBIR project are to develop a scalable deposition method of these advanced catalytic materials onto industrially relevant substrates, to promote and accelerate their integration into commercial products to tackle the growing problem of air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. The technical work will involve the synthesis of these materials and modifications to the synthetic schemes in a way that will be compatible with such large-scale deposition processes, as well as longevity, robustness, and catalytic testing. It will require building equipment for the deposition. Overcoming the technological challenges that are the subject of this SBIR Project will facilitate translation of the nanostructured materials to a broad range of catalytic applications related to pollution abatement and air purification.

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase I project builds a new query engine for K12 that
    addresses four major shortcomings in existing automated question-answering systems.
    The shortcomings prevent both students and teachers from fully leveraging the
    power of such systems. Existing systems 1) cannot handle raw student queries like
    - Ten Ford Fiestas cost $146,000. How much does each Ford Fiesta cost?, 2) do
    not take into account students' skill-levels to return results that is within
    the scope of their understanding, 3) do not have a community vetting and feedback
    mechanism that allows systems to learn the quality of their automated answers,
    and 4) discard valuable insights obtainable from students' queries that can be
    used to inform future classroom instruction. The query engine, which is free to
    use, addresses all four shortcomings, improves classroom instruction and closes
    the achievement gap. It empowers students of all abilities and from all communities
    to obtain automated answers from the AI technology and regular answers from the
    community of users. The community of users on the platform range from students
    to teachers to experts from the industry fulfilling their corporate social responsibilities.
    The platform is compliant with federal and state privacy regulations and is projected
    to earn significant Annual Recurring Revenue from corporations and EdTech companies
    seeking to build their brand among the K12 community. \n\n\nThis project develops
    new skill-aware AI technology that automatically maps student's raw queries into
    topics, sub-topics and intent. The technology considers the user skill-levels
    and automatically constructs an answer extracted from the most relevant educational
    resources, with highest preference given to teachers' own resources. The technology
    does something more if the detected topic falls under Algebra and the intent of
    the query is 'How do I solve this?' It generates, on-the-fly, additional scaffolding
    instructions for solving the problem. This approach extends to disciplines beyond
    Algebra. In addition, Phase I research leverages the latest advancements in Machine
    Learning, Natural Language Processing and Topic Detection to extract and track
    skill-levels, as well as strengths and weaknesses of students for teacher's benefit.
    Finally, the project will also demonstrate the efficacy of the technology in terms
    of queries made, relevant responses generated and its impact in terms of Algebra
    math outcomes.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a protein sample preparation kit that eliminates variability and provides researchers with the information they need to find important protein drug targets and biomarkers.  The high throughput protein analysis methods of proteomics are having a significant impact on the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, from the development of new protein-based drugs to quality control monitoring and biomarker discovery to clinical diagnostics. All proteomics applications require robust, repeatable and automatable sample preparation methods. Currently, however, these methods are not standardized. The lack of the standardization often leads to experimental failure and unreliable results, which may require many rounds of experimental repeats, costing time and money. Standardized protein sample preparation kits will provide significant workflow savings, improve time to market, and accelerate biomarker discovery and drug development.

    The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase I project is to develop a universal peptide isolation kit to serve the diverse needs of the proteomics community.  Currently, methods for sample preparation typically have more than a dozen steps, are prone to peptide loss and bias, and require more than a day to complete.  Through the NSF I-Corps program, it was discovered that more than 70% of researchers in academia and industry are unhappy with current protein sample preparation methods.  To address this need, a sample preparation kit that increases the speed and efficiency of peptide sample preparation was developed. The approach differs from current methods in three fundamental ways.  First, all manipulations will be done in solution in a single tube with half the number of steps compared to existing protocols. Second, a fast, universal, and reversible chemical tag is employed rather than relying on physical separation, preventing sample loss or bias. Third, a stabilized derivative of trypsin will allow for complete digestion of protein samples followed by efficient removal of intact and fragmented trypsin, preventing contamination.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to assist in the commercialization of a new type of engine. Macro-scale vehicle electrification has opened doors to new types of engines not previously practical. Amongst the most interesting of these is the free-piston engine. Free-piston engines (FPE) and Free-piston linear generators (FPLG) are well-suited to electrification because they directly produce electricity instead of torque and do it in a way that is cleaner, more efficient, and better suited to work with advanced electrified vehicles. These engines are inherently more capable of running on a diversity of fuels to enhance both low-carbon fuel consumption and US energy independence. Key to this technology is advanced controls and development of new sensors. This project focuses on development of a new sensor whose lack is a key roadblock to the commercialization of these advanced engines. This new sensor will be employed immediately in the laboratory and test vehicle development of these engines.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to develop the framework of a new integrated circuit (IC) that will enable the mass adoption of clean, efficient free-piston engines. In order to realize practical free-piston engines a position sensor able to measure piston position to 0.1micron (4 millionths of an inch) and up to speed of 30m/s (over 1000 inch/second) is needed. Currently there is no sensor that gives the required speed and precision. The sensors that are close in functionality are large devices that nearly double the length of the engine. The proposed sensor must survive in the harsh thermal and vibration environment of an engine. In phase 1 the company will build a proof of concept from available discrete circuits; to build the actual custom IC in phase II. This sensor will be combined with distributed high-speed computation allowing high-speed piston control at a rate of greater than 10kHz.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) project is to develop wearable sensors for monitoring environmental
    pollution triggers of a chronic respiratory disease, asthma, and empower patients
    to mitigate exacerbations.  The initial target for commercialization is a wearable
    sensor array, integrated with a smart phone, to detect ozone and nitrogen dioxide,
    known to cause increased morbidity and mortality in asthma patients.  The anticipated
    product, functionally referred to as Mobile Environmental Exposure Personal Sensor
    (MEEPS), will use disruptive nanotechnology and signal capture methods to provide
    superior performance at a lower cost, size, weight and power than competing technologies,
    such as optical, UV photometry, heated metal oxide semi-conductor (HMOS) and electro-chemical
    methods.  MEEPS will influence proactive healthcare by implementing personalized
    mitigation approaches tailored to individual symptoms triggered by local exposure,
    and alerting the caregiver or the physician via mobile phone, as necessary.  MEEPS
    can potentially decrease healthcare costs and financial losses, improve productivity
    and overall quality of life of asthma patients worldwide.  Furthermore, MEEPS
    enables uploading continuous airborne pollutant exposure data from several users
    to the cloud for off-line analysis to produce pollution maps, participatory sensing,
    epidemiological studies, asthma community activism, and increased environmental
    awareness in STEM disciplines.  \n\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop
    low-cost mobile sensor arrays for simultaneous exposure measurements of multiple
    chemicals in the ambient personal microenvironment.  No such device exists in
    the market today.  MEEPS utilizes functionalized carbon nanotubes (CNTs), deposited
    as thin-films on small flexible electrodes, for the gas-sensitive element.  The
    innovation lies in improving the sensitivity to the target gas while simultaneously
    reducing the interaction with other oxidizing chemicals present in the environment.
    \ This is achieved by controlling the concentration of functional groups covalently
    attached to the CNTs at the sensor surface.  The baseline drift is corrected by
    differential comparison with the reference signal, periodically monitored prior
    to gas exposure.  MEEPS will integrate CNT detector films with a commercial on-chip
    low-power impedance measurement circuit, which tracks changes in complex impedance
    caused by molecular level chemical adsorption of gases on the film surface.  In
    contrast to the well-known chemiresistor, which measures only the change in resistance,
    MEEPS uses both amplitude and phase to reduce cross-sensitivity to interfering
    chemicals.  The goal of the Phase 1 effort is to mitigate the technical risks
    of selectivity and sensor drift in ambient microenvironment by utilizing transformational
    nanotechnology integrated with patent-pending on-board electronics for impedance
    measurement.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed
    worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit
    and broader impacts review criteria."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project addresses a mechanism to optimize corrosion inhibition for projects covering the oil and gas industry and beyond. Corrosion costs US industries alone an estimated $170 billion a year. The oil and gas industry takes an above average share of these costs because of its complex and demanding production techniques, and the environmental threat should components fail. Today, the standard inhibition mechanism for the oil and gas industry is to inject a chemical inhibitor, typically a surfactant, that can coat the interior of the oilfield tubular and avoid corrosion. Because of the high cost of failure, it is extremely common to over-inject surfactant quantities resulting in excessive costs and the waste of unwanted chemicals sent to the refinery. Unfortunately, there has not previously been a good way to tell when too much surfactant was in fact too much. That is the specific new aspect brought by this innovation. It proposes a mechanism to detect in real-time that there is sufficient surfactant by taking advantage of quantum chemical properties of those surfactants when they are subject to very large magnetic fields and GHz radio-frequency excitation.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to extract a chemical spectrum from a specially designed reagent that can be added to a sample of produced fluid, where that chemical spectrum will change depending on whether there is sufficient surfactant to cause corrosion inhibition. More specifically it is going to measure some quantum chemical properties of the reagent called its hyperfine structure that will change in the presence of surfactant micelles. Essentially the micelles form a containment barrier around free radical electrons within that reagent and thereby change the way those electrons can resonate in the combination of the magnet and RF excitation. Phase 1 of the project will resolve multiple challenges in this approach, including the choice of reagent and the development of robust algorithms to convert hyperfine data into quantification of critical micelle concentration, where the algorithm needs to be able to tolerate typical impurities found in oilfield fluids. Phase 1 will also validate a spectroscopic approach that can result in the hyperfine data being sent to the cloud where AI-based algorithms can reduce the spectral information to actionable information for the operator.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to transform the culture of photosynthetic aquatic microorganisms. Although microalgae and cyanobacteria have high volumetric productivities, the cultures cannot be too deep, due to restrictions of light penetration.  This proposed technology removes the light penetration limit inherent in current technologies. The results of this project will allow the production of medical and food grade biomass in controlled conditions, as the light source will not be connected to the exterior of the culture reactors. This approach will provide the advantages of a fermentation production using phototrophic species, without the need to supply organic carbon. The photosynthetic biomass production makes use of carbon dioxide and light for growth. This project will result in a microalgal/cyanobacterial biomass production in areas where it is not currently feasible and with higher productivity. The increase of the depth of the cultures two, five or more times of what is currently possible, practically reduces the area required for biomass production. A reduction of cost will improve the economic outlook for microalgal-based commodity products, including feed, food, fuels, nutraceuticals and pharmaceuticals and lower the environmental impact.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project addresses one of the most significant problems found in achieving the promise of microalgae and cyanobacteria as source of food, fuels and other products is the limitation of light penetration. Most outdoor cultures are limited to less than 60 cm depth. In reactors with artificial light, besides the light penetration high electrical costs limit their use to high value products.  This project will result in a light system that takes advantage of the water movement in cultures to generate electricity for LED lights in untethered units that move with the culture. The proposed generator uses methods more efficient and lighter that traditional electromagnetic and piezoelectric generators. The developed energy harvester can be used in other applications such as power for water quality monitoring and other sensing equipment. In this phase, a unit with a miniaturized energy harvester coupled with passive switching, charging, discharging and rectifying modules in the same substrate, in a waterproof casing will be developed. Data proof of the suitability of these units to support photosynthetic microorganisms? biomass production will be obtained. The results will inform further development of the units in a future phase.

    This SBIR Phase I project will produce a digital + physical game for 6-10 year olds that fosters computational thinking practices through collaboration, listening, and tinkering through play with music. It is widely recognized that to be ready for the future, today?s students need to develop the ability to think critically, identify and solve complex problems, communicate clearly about their thinking, and work collaboratively with a team. Computational thinking (CT) is the core of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines, and is about developing a set of problem-solving heuristics, approaches and habits of mind. Collaboration and creativity, now seen as cross-cutting 21st Century skills, are also viewed as CT practices. Not all learners are motivated to learn CT through traditional programming contexts, even those designed for young learners. Moreover, there are a lack of learning environments to engage children in tinkering--trying things out and debugging--finding out why things didn?t happen as expected. And, the vast majority of existing CT learning environments for young children do not explicitly support the development of positive attitudes towards problem solving, confidence in dealing with complexity, and communicating and collaborating with others to achieve a goal. This product will enhance students? grasp of collaborative problem solving and ultimately computational thinking by engaging them in fundamental concepts that unite computing and music.


    The core technical innovation of this project is the design and development methodology that will lead to the creation of a transformative learning platform in its approach to learning outcomes, collaborative problem solving, and engaging game play. This multi-user, multi-device experience relies on a new approach to collaborative problem solving, leveraging multiple user inputs responsive to group tinkering and debugging. Players must employ critical listening, tinkering, debugging, and communication to identify pieces of music that are off, and work collaboratively to adjust controllers to get the music back to its original state. This game not only requires problem solving across scales (debugging smaller parts of the puzzle to get to an overall solution) but also requires collaboration and communication, something largely missing in educational games for children. This phase will focus on the build of the digital component of the game as well as conduct research and development around physical controllers. Additionally, this phase of development will research the balance of visual, audio and haptic feedback mechanisms to help players through frustrating moments, foster player communication and collaboration, and test visual design for the most effective feedback.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will result from enabling a secure, scalable, adversarial-resistant, fully private authentication for mobile ecosystems using behavioral biometrics, thereby enabling consumer control of digital privacy. An immediate impact will be the mitigation of mobile based fraud as well as financial burden for companies struggling to build GDPR compliant one-to-many biometric technologies. Besides fraud detection applications, the technology developed to infer multiple user biosignatures passively from smartphones will enable the development of non-invasive and cost-effective telehealth solutions, thereby advancing the state-of-the-art monitoring of health using wearable physiological monitors, Wi-Fi, and radar sensors. Impacts of the project more broadly will result from various education and outreach activities, including internships, mentoring, and participation in seminars and conferences that encourage diversity, and by establishing research and education collaboration with faculty and students in underrepresented communities.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses the long-standing challenge in securing one-to-many biometric systems, widely used in hospitals, border control infrastructure and more. Recent cyber security attacks and privacy violations makes it critical to develop an adversarial resistant technology that enables secure biometric authentication at scale, while at the same time providing rigorous privacy assurance to users. Consequently, this effort will advance the state-of-the-art in key fronts: (1) a new class of sufficiently distinguishable unique behavioral biosignatures extracted passively and non-invasively from high frequency sound waves using deep learning models; (2) efficient privacy-preserving algorithms to enable fully private biometrics while ensuring data utility and faster similarity search; (3) novel techniques to stress-test the machine learning framework in order to discover new attack vectors in behavioral biometrics. This technology will enhance biometrics with user behavioral biosignatures which are exclusively and passively derived from audio sensors on smartphones, using deep transfer learning algorithms, to thwart spoofing and adversarial attacks; furthermore, it will transform sensitive biometric identifiers into revocable and anonymized identifiers, with local differential privacy and hashing-based privacy-preserving algorithms.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to create value for grape farmers by reducing crop damage from frost by delaying the time when the buds break in spring.  The innovation proposed will reduce the costs of frost management, decrease yield loss, and improve quality. Delaying bud break will also assist in labor management by increasing the operating window for optimal shoot removal.  Grapes are the highest value fruit crop in the U.S. and the sixth largest crop globally.  Grape production is highly influenced by the weather, with frost damage among the top weather hazards. Success in the grape market opens the door to deployment with many other fruit crops.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will allow grape growers to reduce frost damage and maximize resources for mechanization. This approach integrates many studies, including: biophysical and biochemical factors influencing the endogenous regulation of bud break, resistance to cold injury, and polymer sciences. Preliminary studies indicate the ability to resist wet conditions and regulate bud break by 10 to 14 days.  If the aims of this project are achieved, the technology will contribute significantly to farmers’ abilities to cope with present and future threats of spring frost, with current mechanization and available labor limitations, and will be the foundation for continued innovation in tools that address current and emerging challenges of climate change. The project will demonstrate the feasibility of the spray through a series of in situ applications with partners in Washington and Illinois. In addition, the project will launch data analytics studies to guide the application timing of bud break delay technology by testing sensors for farm microclimate data acquisition and gaining access to critical data sources.

- abstractText: "The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
    Phase I Project addresses the need for small, low-cost satellites in space to
    have on-board propulsion capabilities. The advent of small satellites is opening
    space to entrepreneurs and researchers to improve telecommunications, monitor
    climate patterns, and conduct other activities. Unfortunately, many of these small
    satellites have no method of maneuvering in space, and so their capabilities are
    limited. Satellite propulsion allows for small satellites to achieve three major
    goals. First, they can reach their preferred orbit without diverting the launching
    spacecraft. Second, they can make minor adjustments to their orbits for many years,
    ensuring they do not re-enter the atmosphere prematurely. And third, at the end
    of the mission they can de-orbit themselves and avoid becoming dangerous space
    debris. An onboard propulsion system will be necessary for the satellite infrastructure
    of the future. By developing this technology now, we can overcome a major obstacle
    in space exploration and assist humanity in expanding to the stars. \n\nThis Small
    Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project is to develop a green, inexpensive,
    and effective small satellite propulsion system. Equipping CubeSats and other
    small spacecraft with onboard propulsion will drastically improve their technological
    capabilities and ensure they deploy, function, and de-orbit safely. The system
    functions by selectively filtering sunlight to heat water to high temperatures
    by limiting radiative heat emissions. The high-temperature steam is exhausted
    through a nozzle and can control the satellite with high efficiency. The major
    goal of this effort will be to experimentally and computationally model optical
    system performance. Other goals will be to validate that the thermal and structural
    systems are suitable for ground launch and operation in space.\n\nThis award reflects

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is a unique continuous-fiber composite that is lightweight and offers enhanced impact resistance and energy absorbance compared to commercially available carbon fiber composites. The demand for advanced composite materials is expected to steadily increase both in the United States and worldwide due to rapid growth in aerospace and automotive applications, as well as defense and clean energy applications. Though valued for their high strength-to-weight and lightweight properties, traditional and commonly-utilized fiber-reinforced composites composed of carbon fiber or fiberglass tend to exhibit brittle properties and low impact tolerance. Lack of damage tolerance leads to various forms of localized and nonlocalized material failure, compromising the material's structural integrity and incurring replacement costs and scrap waste. Developing composite materials that can withstand impact scenarios and possess damage tolerance is necessary to enable more widespread adoption of these materials across a variety of applications.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will explore material development and processing methodologies to progress and optimize the performance of the proposed novel composite material. The project will evaluate the feasibility of formulations composed of different iterations of this material technology while evaluating pre- and post-processing techniques for performance and scalability. Additional refinement strategies such as enhancing the fiber-matrix bond for enhanced anti-crack propagation and energy distribution will also be explored. This will be coupled with testing methodologies demonstrating various material property classifications as well as application-specific, proof-of-concept testing to demonstrate performance effectiveness. The goal is to approach the isotropic properties and impact resistance of high-performance metal alloys while retaining the lightweight, high strength-to-weight performance of carbon fiber composites.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to address the critical market pain points and demand for damage-free, yet secure and repeatedly usable adhesive fasteners that can perform well on both dry and wet surfaces. This project develops a reusable adhesive fastener that is a non-tacky, quickly-reversible adhesive, exhibiting high joining strength and reversibility. Due to the unique mechanism the device uses to toggle its adhesion, this device leaves the underlying surface damage-free.  The fastener is easily removable, repeatedly usable, and potentially will have low manufacturing costs. Such an adhesive fastener enables the user to easily and securely mount and dismount moderately heavy objects without the risk of damaging or leaving residue on the mounting surface, even on moderately porous and rough surfaces.  Furthermore, since the adhesive fastener is water-resistant, high-performance fastening can also be applied in wet environments, expanding the potential market applications.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate an adhesive fastener that works with high reliability and durability in diverse environmental conditions, with effective activation methods.  Shape memory polymer (SMP) formulations and the mechanics at the adhesive contact interface will be optimized to make the  fastener more resistant to contact failure. Since the adhesive contact failure mode of this adhesive fastener is typically fracture, there will be significant efforts on refining the mechanical design to retard adhesive contact fracture, and the resulting performance in terms of joining strength and duration will be quantitatively determined. An optimized fabrication process for conductive SMPs will be developed by incorporating conductive fillers into the SMP material to enable continuous production, ensuring uniform product quality and enabling scalable manufacturing. For this purpose, the effective Joule-heating, shape memory effect, and final reversible adhesive properties of the conductive SMP upon conductive filler composition, concentration, and spatial concentration configuration will be investigated. The adhesive performance in wet conditions of the SMP will be demonstrated and systematically tested to minimum performance standards under a variety of liquid types and thermomechanical loading conditions.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will explore the development the High Efficiency Rapid Magnetic Erythrocyte Separator (H.E.R.M.E.S), a highly translational blood-plasma separation system enabling the decentralization of commercial blood testing. Blood testing is currently limited to centralized testing labs due to the requirements of centrifugation, a key first step in the majority of diagnostic testing. However, centrifuges are not suitable for use at the point-of-care and have created a bottleneck in the translation of bench-to-bedside testing. H.E.R.M.E.S is a unique magnetic bead-based separation method to quickly obtain plasma free of red blood cells. The technology is a low-cost and standalone platform with the potential to augment the testing efficiency and translational ability of existing blood-based diagnostic tests. Specifically, this effort will examine the potential for H.E.R.M.E.S to augment Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) diagnostic and viral load quantification testing in finger-stick and whole blood, when used with standard lab-based and rapid diagnostic assays. Access to higher quality HIV tests will have a major impact for public health and improved diagnostic outcomes. H.E.R.M.E.S will address the lack of availability of low-cost and efficient sample processing technologies and help introduce the next generation of robust point-of-care blood tests.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will enable the implementation of a magnetic-bead based separation assay to achieve low-complexity and rapid blood-plasma separation in point-of-care testing environments. The technology will enhance current blood-testing capabilities at the point-of-care and has the potential to enable the development of highly robust diagnostic tests. This Phase I effort will demonstrate the feasibility of the underlying technology for companion use with commercially existing laboratory-based and rapid diagnostic HIV assays. The compatibility of the separation assay will be verified by comparing the performance of the diagnostic assay with different sample types: blood, centrifuged plasma and H.E.R.M.E.S plasma. This proposal will explore the potential to use the unique sample type generated by H.E.R.M.E.S to enhance HIV diagnostic testing outcomes by providing earlier detection. The end result is a device that can process blood into a sample that will augment the performance of blood-based diagnostic testing.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is the development of a high energy density, low-cost energy storage technology.  Affordable long duration energy storage is critical to the wide adoption of renewable power.  This is a growing market segment which is underserved by current (e.g., lithium-ion battery) storage technologies.  Energy storage can be of importance in rural communities where the impacts of power disruption are severe.  This project seeks to develop energy storage that, when paired with solar or wind renewable power, is cheaper than fossil fuel-based generation.  Such a development would accelerate the transition to a modern clean energy economy, would reduce the environmental impacts of power generation, and would increase the economic resilience of rural communities.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to develop an electrochemical energy storage device.  Flow batteries are a compelling option for long-duration energy storage, as the energy storage (chemicals in tanks) is decoupled from the power delivery (in an electrochemical cell).  A major hurdle for flow batteries has been the high cost of the chemicals used for storage (e.g., vanadium).  This Phase I project develops a flow battery that makes use of commonly available and high energy density hydrogen and halogen chemical compounds.  The project extends this flow battery technology into new concentration and fluid dynamical regimes that will enable commercial scaling of the technology.  This project also tests novel bipolar plates made from modern composite materials, examining their suitability as low-cost, long lifespan cell components in commercial production.  Laboratory efforts are complemented by the development of validated numerical models which will be used to optimize cell design.  These laboratory experiments and validated numerical models in the high halogen concentration regime will open new windows for electrochemical energy storage at community and grid scales.

    (SBIR) Phase I project is modernizing monitoring systems for the forestry industry,
    environmental sustainability, and nature conservation purposes. The estimated
    commercial potential on the $325 B global forestry industry is an additional $3.4
    B of unlocked value through faster, cheaper, and more accurate inventory systems.
    Warmer temperatures have contributed to an explosion in pest epidemics that have
    destroyed over 120 million acres of timberland in the US since 1998. In addition,
    these temperatures and dead trees have exacerbated wildland fire, with annual
    economic damage estimated to be $350 B. The societal impact of these problems
    is pervasive, as smoke plumes can drift for thousands of miles and adversely affect
    human health and environmental pollution. One fundamental requirement to address
    these problems is an automated forest monitoring system, as current systems still
    heavily rely on manual measurements. This project will enhance scientific and
    technological understanding by developing autonomous and large-scale semantic
    mapping robotic systems for dense, natural forests to tackle these broader high-impact
    problems. In addition, this project will provide high-tech career opportunities
    in rural communities by training skilled operators to develop, deploy, and control
    the robot teams in forests. \n\n\nThis Small Business Innovation (SBIR) Phase
    I project will develop the first commercially viable automated timber cruise to
    estimate forest volume from below the canopy level. The forestry industry still
    relies on manual measurements because, due to fundamental technical challenges,
    the technology to autonomously measure tree sizes under the canopy over long distances
    does not exist. This project will overcome two limiting challenges: 1) Robust
    Autonomy Challenge: No one has achieved robust autonomy in truly 3D, unstructured,
    GPS-denied environments where manual control (teleoperation) is not feasible;
    and 2) Large-Scale Semantic Mapping Challenge: No one has attempted semantic mapping
    at the scale and accuracy proposed, as most demonstrations have been for a few
    object instantiations and without the need for precise measurement. To tackle
    these challenges, the project anticipates three technical results: 1) Real-time
    tree detection to robustly detect trees in challenging conditions; 2) Continuous-Time
    Semantic Simultaneous Localization and Mapping to precisely model trees over vast
    distances; and 3) Fast Online Motion Planning with Deep Model Predictive Control
    to robustly navigate unmanned aerial vehicles in cluttered forest environments.\n\nThis

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will result from building a computer vision platform that will help make communities more useful and appealing to their occupants regardless of demographic data, with shopping malls as the pilot application.  Shopping malls of the future will blur the lines between community center and retail space as malls become mixed-use spaces where people will not only shop, but will also live, work, and play. To make this transition, shopping mall companies need detailed demographic information regarding mall visitors. The company’s technology will enable improved state-of-the-art pedestrian movement and demographic classification, without collecting any personally identifiable information. This will enable shopping mall operators to understand and improve their tenant mix, and thereby better foster communities nationwide. The data generated could also benefit other industries by revolutionizing property analysis: governments can use demographic data to analyze changing populations and urban planners can use foot-traffic information to make cities cleaner and more efficient. The technology will enable a more detailed understanding of changing communities and how to help them thrive, without the privacy compromises that usually accompany video-based technologies. The company intends to remain at the forefront of privacy-preserving practices with regard to data collection and management.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will solve three crucial problems in video analytics for obtaining demographic information, while avoiding the need to collect personally identifiable information, namely: (1) classification of pedestrian demographics in a public setting, (2) accurate group detection and path (motion) analysis, and (3) stable path analysis using network camera imagery. There are currently no large-scale systems capable of accurately extracting both demographic and path information from network camera imagery. The proposed technology will analyze video data from a network of cameras placed throughout a shopping mall, extract demographic foot-traffic patterns to generate demographic and path data, and then permanently delete the video. Developing technology that effectively recovers from occlusions that arise in dense environments is crucial to the commercial adoption of the project.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop thermally conductive 3D printing materials for cooling of high-performance electronic devices.  As electronic devices become more compact and energy-dense, there is a growing challenge of overheating, resulting in poor performance and device failure. This problem is particularly relevant to transportation and energy-related technologies increasingly reliant on high-performance electronic components, such as electric motors, battery packs, power electronics, and high-performance processors.  This project will develop a new additive manufacturing composite material with thermal conductivity 1000x higher than standard plastics, enabling lightweight, corrosion-resistant, and high-performance heat transfer technologies. Moreover, the materials enable 3D printing on low-cost desktop Fused Deposition Modeling printers without significant hardware modifications, drastically reducing the complexity and cost of printing high performance components. By creating a transformational material for use on a broadly accepted additive manufacturing technology platforms, this project will help create a new market for advanced heat transfer technologies that can significantly increase the performance of electronic devices.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will result in the development of plastic composite materials with higher effective thermal conductivity than aluminum and the ability to be printed on low cost 3D printers. Thermally conductive plastic composites are traditionally composed of base polymer and a high content of thermally conductive filler particles, resulting in poor mechanical properties, high viscosity, high cost and processing difficulties (including inability to 3D print reliably), and a maximum thermal conductivity of ~30 W/m-K (nearly an order of magnitude lower than aluminum). Metals conduct heat well, but are heavy, expensive to manufacture into complex shapes, and can be susceptible to corrosion and fouling when interacting with fluids. This project is proposing a new composite system consisting of a core-shell structure with a core of continuous high thermal conductivity continuous fiber and a shell of a composite thermally conductive matrix. Utilizing 3D printing, this material can be printed into complex shapes to produce new heat transfer parts such as heat sinks, heat exchangers, liquid coldplates and other technologies with thermal performance exceeding metals.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this SBIR Phase I project will advance the development of a bioabsorbable tissue sealant for use in the closure of internal surgical site wounds. Wound care is associated with significant healthcare and economic costs. Surgical wounds account for the majority of acute wounds, as there are over 100 million surgical incisions a year globally, where approximately 80% require a closure product. Improper or ineffective closure of surgical wounds can result in a number of complications, including infection, scarring, improper healing, and blood loss. Currently available products for use in closing internal surgical wounds are often limited in their effectiveness due to low versatility, safety concerns, and slow curing times. An ideal tissue adhesive would provide sufficient strength and be bioabsorbable, thus providing for effective wound closure for internal and external applications. Bezwada Biomedical seeks to meet this unmet need through the development of a polyurethane-based adhesive for internal surgical wounds that is biodegradable, easy to use, and biocompatible. Successful commercialization of this technology will provide clinicians and surgeons with an effective and versatile wound closure product for surgical applications, thus decreasing the likelihood of complications that significantly impact patient outcomes and increase the costs of care.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a polyurethane-based tissue adhesive incorporating hydrolyzable linkage bridging using safe and biocompatible compounds through an innovative chemistry approach. The hydrolyzable feature differentiates the technology from existing absorbable polyurethanes and is the result of highly reactive aromatic isocyanates with a hydrolyzable link connecting the aromatic rings, allowing for safe and tunable degradation. The overall goal of the proposed program is to identify a single lead polyurethane formulation with two Technical Objectives:  1) synthesis of monomers and development of formulations; 2) assessment for physical, mechanical, functional, biocompatibility, and ease-of-use properties to identify the optimal formulation.

    as polystyrene foam. Currently, this material is made with a hot molding process
    that creates high-quality foam, but it is challenging to scale for mass production
    of the volumes required to service the packaging industry. With this project,
    the company will develop a process that is fully scalable and uses existing equipment
    for the production of polystyrene foam for quicker adoption.  The goals of the

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to combat online trade in counterfeit and illicit goods. The project will integrate the results of a decade of academic research on anonymous online ("dark net") marketplaces and modeling of counterfeit pharmaceutical online sales with novel monitoring solutions for traditional e-commerce marketplaces. It will allow for the development and validation through pilot customer tests of an integrated platform for automated continuous data collection and analysis of the major players in the counterfeit and illicit goods online business. Through automation, the proposed technology should considerably reduce costs to brand protection managers (and law enforcement), allowing them to use their limited resources more effectively. This work should also help address some pressing economic and public health issues linked to the proliferation of counterfeits, such as counterfeit drugs.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate automation of many manual online counterfeiting monitoring activities. The project will also show that intuitive visual interfaces can help customers (law enforcement agencies, brand protection managers) have immediate access to higher-level objects more useful for investigative purposes. These higher-level objects include metrics on the amount of sales conducted by a specific entity, deduplication between vendors, or inventory clustering. To do so, the project will further develop automated classification and analysis using techniques that were prototyped in the research lab, scale these techniques up to a production environment to further minimize human intervention, and combine these techniques with novel algorithms developed for slightly different application cases (traditional e-commerce marketplaces).

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will result from improving the quality of healthcare in the United States and reducing the associated costs for common elective surgery procedures through evidence-driven patient-physician matching. This technology will improve the quality of care and reduce the variation in costs associated with these procedures. The platform will better equip health facilities to deliver sustainable, high-quality care in an industry that is transitioning towards value-based care. The commercial impact of the project will result from generating savings to healthcare facilities. Personalized physician scheduling helps patients access the most beneficial care and has the potential to reduce complications and improve patient outcomes. Facility-level cost reduction and patient outcome improvement enabled by this technology not only translates to cost savings for patients, but also increased capacity for the healthcare facilities.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will address the need for reducing the variations in outcomes and costs in elective medical care procedures with respect to factors including physician availability, the impact of care teams on medical outcomes and cost, and the effects of physician training and learning over time. The approach will be based on a unique combination of data analytics, stochastic processes, and machine learning, applied to the patient-provider matching problem. The technical challenges to be addressed in this project include the dynamic nature of physician strengths, the difficulty in attribution of outcomes to individual physicians in a team, and the challenges in adapting to the databases of health facilities. The team will closely collaborate with healthcare partners, leveraging historical data on physician and team performance over time as well as their feedback to develop an impactful and scientifically justified prototype. Anticipated technical results include documentation of the results of the proposed research and a prototype version of the technology for use at the healthcare facility level.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to accelerate product development and domestic manufacturing by introducing a new method of fabricating products in a geographically distributed manner. The United States enjoys global prominence as a hub for cutting-edge research and creative design. However, investment has migrated overseas where many products have been manufactured with lower labor costs and less stringent environmental regulations, including shifting prototyping, design work and initial production overseas. Shifting accessibility and agility of manufacturing from factories to owner-operated 3D printers can accelerate cycle times, spur innovation among American companies, and in some cases reduce the risks associated with product development. Moreover, it has the potential to create jobs as more individuals can participate in the manufacturing process, while introducing American households to 3D printing technology and workforce collaboration utilizing distributed ledger technology.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to construct a supply chain and intellectual property management system on a distributed ledger. We will focus initially on concrete examples to show potential for new modes of prototyping and collaboration at the nexus of 3D printing and distributed ledgers.  Initial archetypes focus on thermoplastics that can be 3D printed and assembled in a modular manner, beginning with small parts less than 25 cm in length. In the process of designing and 3D printing these products, we are also creating a database of industrial design motifs enabling larger objects to be constructed from reusable component parts. This system will coordinate a network of privately owned 3D printers; when a customer places an order, each individual part will be shipped to the customer from collaborators with 3D printers. As industrial design motifs is recorded in an open manner, the success of a motif is closely linked to the creator of the work, incentivizing collaborative and iterative product development by closely tying the success of a product to the individuals who contributed to its design and fabrication. Key goals of this Phase I project include analyzing core elements of this proposed distributed model of manufacturing, including order fulfillment, logistics, cost analysis,intellectual property attribution, and quality control.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to democratize mass timber systems, rendering them accessible across the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry. Buildings account for 40% of all greenhouse gas emissions, indicating an urgent need for energy-intelligent building prototypes. Mass timber buildings require less energy for production than competitive technologies and were approved in 2019 by the International Building Code for structures of up to 18 stories in the US.  Yet, they remain inaccessible as a technology, in part because developers, architects and manufacturers remain unfamiliar with mass timber and its benefits. This proposal seeks to unlock a latent market of development potential on sites to which mass timber offers unique advantages. Because our technology integrates adaptable-to-site building solutions into the industry's supply chain, it is designed to improve adoption by reducing risks, barriers, and costs usually associated with innovative technologies. By giving designers, engineers, and builders access to cutting-edge mass timber building systems, our proposal aims to encourage the use of a sustainable and profitable technology for the rapid urbanization of North American cities.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will focus on developing adaptable mass timber building solutions that are replicable and commercializable. This will be achieved by designing a variety of rigorously tested and cost-effective building solutions in mass timber and developing a generative design system that can generate and deploy optimal building proposals using these pre-designed building solutions. The first component of our technology comprises the development of pre-approved structural building solutions across a range of building scales (3-18 stories) and mass-timber technologies, including novel hybrid structural solutions developed with support from manufacturers and engineers. The second component the generative system will handle different development scenarios from large urban blocks to small urban infill sites. The tool will generate a wide variety of potential compliant options, analyze and test these for user-specified performance metrics, and sort among them to find a best-case building proposal. The tool will incorporate the structural solutions developed in the first component of the work and deploy them within their constraints to test real-world building solutions against the constraints of each development project. The tool will also seamlessly integrate with existing BIM (Building Information Modeling) project-delivery platforms for easy interoperability.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is rooted in the development of a large-scale synthesis for the manufacture of highly uniform hollow metal nanospheres for use by the military in potentially contaminated zones of operation, in rural settings with limited access to healthcare laboratories, or in the agricultural field for faster and more affordable detection of lower levels of food-based toxins and pathogens. Furthermore, establishing a source of these next-generation metal nanoparticles at commercially relevant levels of quality and quantity with consistent and predictable performance would pave the way for their expansion into other industries that could also benefit from their advantages, such as photocatalysis, water purification, and photomedicine.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will scale-up the production of hollow metal nanoparticles from the existing small-batch syntheses to a large-scale continuous flow process, with strict standards for the control of their size, shape, and optical response. Large-scale synthesis of highly uniform hollow metal nanospheres with controllable size has not been achieved to date, hampering the use and study of these advanced materials. A high-quality, high-volume production method will position hollow metal nanospheres for rapid commercial adoption in applications where they markedly outperform their solid counterparts, such as in color reporting for lateral flow assays (LFAs), where hollow gold nanospheres can offer a 10-fold improvement in assay sensitivity.  The primary objective of the proposed work is to determine the parameters necessary for a high-quality, high-throughput synthesis based on continuous flow, including reactor materials, chamber dimensions, precursor concentrations, flow rates, and reaction times. The major technical hurdle lies in the identification (within a very large parameter space) of suitable conditions for a successful and controlled synthesis; accordingly, a major component of this project is in-depth analysis and characterization of synthesized nanoparticles by optical spectroscopy and electron microscopy. Characterization results will be used to inform iterative reactor improvements. The resulting high throughput reactor will both advance the state of the art of nanomaterial synthesis and enable new research by creating a consistent supply of commercially available hollow nanoparticles with reproducible physical properties.

The proposed research applies an innovative high-frequency radio-frequency design process to address emerging market needs that current products and design processes are unable to meet. The key feature of the design process proposed is its basis on technically rigorous transistor-centric measurement and model-based design processes and capabilities. This will serve present and next generation applications in legacy 3G/4G, emerging 5G, Public Safety and Wireless Charging markets.

    The proposed project uses an innovative high-efficiency design technique for solid state power amplifier (SSPA) integrated circuit (IC) products operating in the Ultra-High Frequency (UHF), S and C bands. These new IC's will utilize GaN-on-Si, which is far more cost-viable with high volume wafer sizes up to eight-inches in diameter as compared to the conventional GaN-on-SiC substrate material.  Use of GaN-on-Si semiconductors, combined with our new design technique, will achieve efficiencies far beyond incumbent products through waveform engineering and time-domain load-pull methods. Anticipated technical results include GaN SSPA pallet amplifier products realized on the UHF, S and C bands by the end of Phase I, corresponding to the markets of wireless charging/RF-energy, public safety wireless networks and 5G communications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to advance the state of the art of additive manufacturing, through development of a novel foam resin technology for rapid 3-D printing of ultra low-density parts with high strength-to-weight ratios. The demand for lightweight, high-strength printed parts is growing across all sectors of the manufacturing industry.  The additive manufacturing market is expected to more than double by 2026, with high resolution vat photopolymerization as its largest market segment (>$1 B).  By accelerating production speeds and overcoming size limitations that have limited manufacturing output to small products, the technology also opens the doors for general manufacturing. Within the automotive, aviation and shipping industries, for example, the technology will support lightweighted designs, thus increasing efficiency, while lowering energy consumption, material consumption, and greenhouse gas emissions, resulting in lightweight printed parts.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project  will develop a novel method to modify the high resolution vat photopolymerization process, to enable 3D printing with resin that is foamed using a patent-pending process. Because the proposed technology can be adapted for use on most vat photopolymerization systems, industries can apply it to their existing resins, machines, and processes.  The technology will allow for the manufacture of lightweight parts with up to 75% gas fractions, translating to parts that are 75% lighter and less expensive to produce compared to traditional additive manufacturing processes.  In order to establish proof-of-concept and progress the technology toward commercialization, several critical objectives must be met. Materials that can produce strong, lightweighted products using this technology will be identified. Different types of materials will be investigated in experiments designed to vary the gas fraction in the cured foam, and at least 3 resin formulations will be selected to generate foams for further evaluation of their mechanical properties. The results of three types of tests (compression, impact, and 3-point bending) on foams printed using the proprietary PrintFoam process will be compared to other materials to demonstrate that the technology delivers materials with improved strength-to-weight ratios. In addition, plans for scale-up of the machine and technology will be generated.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to extend advanced manufacturing beyond prototyping to enable higher productivity throughput in digital-to-physical processes.  Combinatorial algorithms, including machine learning, manage both the digital thread and the physical creation workflow of direct digital manufacturing applications, while retaining open-ended (change-friendly) design evolution and agile part creation.  From entrepreneurial activities to military applications, the dynamic nature of customer/mission needs requires quick reaction in both design and end-product roll-out.  Synchronizing the rapid design process with an agile manufacturing process is required to minimize response lags.  The algorithms developed in this SBIR project solve the end-to-end communication inconsistencies across the digital-to-physical threshold while increasing productivity and reducing the negative impact of costly unplanned downtime.  The desired result of this SBIR project is to enhance throughput and deliver the needed logistics to intelligent advanced manufacturing.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to validate the combinatorial algorithm solving the inventory management and production queueing needed to ensure that the digital design evolution and on-going production via additive manufacturing remain in synchronicity.   Rapid manufacturing is achieved when the counter-intuitive part creation queueing is adequately solved so activities downstream of the point of fabrication, like assembly and integration, occurs in sync with the long lead fabrication of larger parts.  Essentially, workers downstream remain productive as longer lead parts are being fabricated/printed.  However, the problem is compounded when the design of the product is open-ended and creates ongoing disruption to the production queueing and downstream post assembly/integration.   The dynamic impact of open-ended design evolution on physical fabrication evolution creates significant management difficulties; therefore, the combinatorial algorithm and its machine learning capability is the key enabler to creating smart manufacturing.

    Phase I project is to enable manufacturers of solar cell assemblies to conduct

    of the envisioned technology are firms that make the assemblies (known as \"strings\"),

    renewable market applications, such as testing cracks on incoming silicon wafers
    prior to vacuum deposition of thin layers for back-side solar cells. The production-grade

    new jobs.  In Phase I, Ultrasonic Technologies will team with a US-based module
    producer to integrate and validate the prototype in a commercial stringer and
    production environment. The project will be supported by two university research
    teams which provide education and training of graduate students in a high-tech

    string through a specially designed multi-head vacuum chuck. The string stressing
    is followed by fast measurements of the responding deflection of the cell caused
    by vacuum loading. This deflection provides a sensitive means to assess the cell's

    will adhere to a throughput rate of 4,200 cells per hour or a cycle time of 0.85
    seconds per cell in modern production stringers. In parallel, the vacuum chuck

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is providing faster, cheaper and lower power alternatives to central processing units (CPUs) and graphic processing units (GPUs),  making machine learning more accessible to students, engineers and scientists. In general, this will lead to faster product development and shorter time-to-market in the artificial intelligence market. Highly power-efficient machine learning accelerators make training and complex inferences possible on so-called "Edge" devices and can revolutionize the way machine learning tasks are performed for end users. By enabling fast and power-efficient Edge computing, this innovation benefits society by reducing data traffic while preserving privacy and data security since data never leave the device. The Total Addressable Market for hardware accelerators for machine learning applications was estimated to be around $1B in 2017 but will likely grow at a 50% Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) until 2025 to $66 B. High power-efficiency and scalability of this innovation gives it an immense competitive advantage to penetrate different segments within this market.

    The proposed project aims to develop a fast, scalable and area- and power-efficient matrix multiplier for machine learning applications. Matrix multiplication is at the heart of all machine learning algorithms and is the most computationally expensive task in these applications. Most hardware accelerator solutions store inputs, weights and partial sums in memory and retrieve them sequentially in order to perform matrix multiplication. The data movements between memory and computational units dominate the overall power consumption and latency of the system. By performing computations in memory, a significant power and area savings can be achieved. This SBIR project seeks to develop a technology to perform mixed-signal matrix multiplication in memory to significantly improve the speed and power- and area-efficiency of machine learning accelerators. Phase I will involve the design and verification of a matrix multiplier that can perform machine learning tasks more efficiently.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this SBIR Phase I project leverages node-pore sensing with multi-marker screening for viable, functionally-preserved isolation of single urothelial carcinoma of the bladder stem cells. This tool will help enable more comprehensive biomarker discovery and facilitate the development of targeted therapies. Ultimately, this solution will allow for clinical, academic, and industrial researchers to selectively isolate single cells from fragile primary bladder biopsy subpopulations for downstream analysis and personalized treatment development in the longer term. The ability to screen for numerous parameters and isolate target urothelial carcinoma of the bladder stem cells in a walk-up usable, accessible, and low-cost manner will enable downstream functional studies that will help lead to improved patient outcomes. In conjunction with the business opportunity here, there is projected to be a significant positive impact on research output and publications that will be enabled by the introduction of a low-cost urothelial carcinoma of the bladder stem cell isolation instrument to research, industrial/biopharma, and clinical facilities.

    This SBIR Phase I project involves a multi-parametric approach leveraging label-free node-pore sensing and low-shear microfluidics for viable single-cell sorting and dispensing while preserving viability and functional characteristics for downstream assays. Characterization and isolation of single, live functionally-preserved urothelial carcinoma of the bladder cancer stem cells is pivotal for the determination of universally accepted, clinically-accurate biomarkers for early cancer detection as well as optimized targeted therapy development. This project is aimed at delivering easy access to these cells without requiring extensive experimental design and tuning, enabling operation by untrained, non-expert users. Using the novel detection and isolation methodologies, the platform can be used to unveil masked heterogeneity and enable downstream functional studies (such as growth, invasion, and chemotherapeutic resistance) on individually isolated, viable, and functionally-preserved isolated urothelial carcinoma of the bladder stem cells.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is the development of a new imaging platform technology that has the potential to affect many areas including consumer imaging, medical imaging, spectroscopy, astronomy, surveillance, and defense.  Transitioning this technology into real applications will mean this technology can be used for personalized experiences, improved quality of life, and increased safety.

    The STTR Phase I proposed project will develop inexpensive, lensless imaging devices (contrary to the current state-of-art cameras, that rely on lenses to form a focused image), that can be integrated with internet-of-things (IoT) devices to gather visual data. Since the lens in a camera accounts for the vast majority of the cost and the weight, these devices can provide order of magnitude reductions in cost, allowing cameras to be integrated into a much larger array of home, auto, and city-scale smart devices. The research tasks in this project are: (1) developing fast, real-time algorithms for image reconstruction exploiting advances in optimization and machine learning (2) developing face detection, recognition, and tracking algorithms that operate with the lensless imaging platform for IoT applications like personalization, and (3) improving data communication (wired or wireless) to meet current and future IoT needs by exploring end-to-end system integration and optimization.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project is to develop a targeted biological pesticide for control of the western flower thrips to reduce the impact of one of the most economically devastating agricultural pests. Thrips are a global agricultural pest that carry a family of viruses that can infect more than 1,000 species of plants including a wide variety of vegetable, fruit, and nut crops, causing an estimated $1 billion in losses each year around the world. Traditional chemical methods for control have proven ineffective and the western flower thrips has acquired resistance to over 30 different synthetic pesticides worldwide. The same is true for over 500 species of insects and mites, and several billion dollars worth of crops are lost each year due to damage caused by resistant pests. Widespread adoption of an alternative to synthetic pesticides will drastically reduce the indirect economic costs of pesticide use, estimated in one study at $10B in environmental and societal costs in the United States each year, and save up to a billion dollars in direct costs by reducing the impact of destructive pests.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to develop a novel biopesticide specifically engineered to target the western flower thrips that can be applied to host plants through a single spray application. In Phase I, the goal is to demonstrate proof-of-principle for using a proprietary bioparticle engineering platform to develop the biopesticide. The technical hurdles that will be addressed include 1) demonstrating that the bioparticle can be ingested by thrips, 2) showing that delivery of the biopesticide to the thrips gut is sufficient to reduce fitness, and 3) identifying the optimal bioparticle formulation for further testing. The first technical objective will focus on the engineering and characterization of a variety of bioparticles that will be tested for efficacy in thrips in Technical Objective 2. Successful completion of this project will provide a prototype biopesticide with a demonstrated effect on the fitness of the western flower thrips. With this prototype, the plan is to proceed to greenhouse and small field trials to inform further product refinement prior to large scale field testing. Successful completion of this project will not only enable the development of a thrips biocide but will provide proof-of-concept for adapting such bioparticle-based biopesticides to target a range of additional insect pests.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will result from providing an accurate real-time awareness solution for those who suffer from body-focused repetitive behaviors. Over 4% of Americans suffer from skin picking, hair pulling, and nail biting, the majority of whom resort to covering up the problem with makeup, gloves, wigs, and even tattoos due to treatment cost barriers and lack of effective tools to facilitate behavior change. While behavior therapy, and in particular habit reversal training, has shown efficacy, this method is traditionally burdened by unreliable journaling, a lack of access to treatment, and difficulty for patients to perform in real-time because of a lack of awareness. While real-time awareness devices do exist, there is room for improvement in detection accuracy. This project will examine feasibility of a novel sensor system within a wearable device that can significantly improve detection accuracy of BFRB-related behaviors.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop and validate a novel wearable sensing system used to detect subtle movements associated with BFRBs that is suitable for large-scale manufacturing. We believe the proposed wearable system can improve the efficacy of leading behavior therapy methods. To accomplish these goals, early studies will focus on three main objectives. First, the team will investigate the best electrical and spatial configuration of the proposed sensors in a tightly controlled test setup. Second, the team will integrate the optimal configuration into a device suitable for testing and validate the integrity of the sensor output on individuals. Finally, the team will develop a proof-of-concept BFRB recognition algorithm under ideal, low-noise conditions.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will result from bringing AI-driven decision making to the fingertips of anyone who can use Excel. In particular, through Excel Macros, this product enables the following capabilities: Predictive Analytics, What-If Scenario Analysis, and Optimized Decision Recommendations. This enables teams of all sizes and capabilities to utilize data-driven decision making without the need for expensive infrastructure or highly skilled data scientists.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to bring together Graphical Model driven prediction and optimization to solve generic reinforcement learning. This will be an important innovation since a decision-making framework that uses Graphical Models as the substrate to solve generic reinforcement learning / AI problems at scale is non-existent and very challenging. To this end, the innovation is twofold: in efficiently representing Excel data as Graphical Models, and in the data substrate to compute over Graphical Models in a scalable and seamless manner, on a single machine (e.g. a laptop), as well as multiple machines.

    smart infrastructure in a connected environment while ensuring unprecedented cybersecurity
    and trusted data within CAV. The innovation will exploit the upcoming 5G connection,
    to speed up the transmission of the communication laying down the first stone
    for the creation of the next generation of intelligent transportation and IoT

    challenges of client-infrastructure networks including poor latency, bandwidth
    constraints, data privacy, cybersecurity and high infrastructure cost, which limit
    scalability needed to support the increasing number of connected IoT devices.
    The new system takes advantage of multi-access edge computing to lower latency

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will result from improving the efficiency of air traffic operations and unlocking runway and airspace capacity utilization, thus enabling reduction of emissions, noise impact, flight delays, and operational cost of airports and airlines. As urban metropolitan areas have grown and air traffic has increased, capacity constraints at airports and their surrounding airspace result in daily delays, which propagate throughout the entire National Airspace System affecting almost every person in modern society with negative impact on the economy, the environment, and airport neighboring communities. The proposed innovation will enable airport authorities, airlines and air navigation service providers in the US and worldwide to more efficiently plan, design and manage airspace and airports systems, facilitating the seamless sharing of information between stakeholders, ultimately enabling the transition of the air traffic management system into the future and resulting in significant benefits for the traveling public and the local communities.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop the first-of-its-kind Airspace Information Model (AIM), a dedicated software platform for airspace and airport system planning and design. Currently, airport authorities, airlines and the air navigation service providers use a plethora of tools for airspace and airport system design, planning and performance evaluation. However, existing tools only cater for specific aspects of the operation in isolation and fail to properly evaluate the interactions between system design components and the trade-offs between different performance objectives. As a result, system performance is sub-optimal. The proposed AIM platform combines the functions of Design, Performance Evaluation and Optimization in a single parametric model addressing the airspace design and planning process from a holistic perspective. It also makes an immediate evaluation of all performance trade-offs possible, while accounting for design rules and criteria. Furthermore, this SBIR proposes the development and integration into the AIM platform of the Dynamic Route Concept (DRC), a novel airspace design optimization method that automatically matches airspace design configuration to dynamic air traffic demand, thus enabling pre-tactical decision-making and optimal system performance. The proposed technology has the potential to become the industry-wide standard.

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project falls within the scope of the grand challenges
    in health informatics. There are excellent protocols for the management and treatment
    of acute stroke, however, these protocols are only effective once patients have
    been admitted into the healthcare system. Health care providers, however, have
    limited interaction with their patients, and these interactions occur in the highly
    constrained environment of the clinical setting. Physicians have limited control
    over patient behavior and limited ability to recognize stroke symptoms outside
    the clinical setting. For patients with high stroke risk, there is currently no
    system available to monitor stroke symptoms and initiate a response in real-time.
    Thus, there is a need to monitor patients remotely, where the current systems
    for stroke response fail to provide coverage. The proposed solution will expand
    the provision of stroke symptom monitoring to the daily lives of patients. Tracking
    patients as they go through their daily lives will considerably enrich our knowledge
    of stroke and will allow extension to monitoring for other neurological and neuropsychiatric
    disorders and diseases. \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase
    I project addresses the real-time detection of stroke. Ischemic stroke affects
    700,000 Americans, costs approximately $33 billion annually, and is the fifth
    leading cause of death and a leading cause of disability in the US. IV tissue
    plasminogen activator (tPA) has been an FDA approved therapy since 1995, yet only
    5-10% of eligible patients receive this therapy. Arrival time in the emergency
    room after initial stroke symptoms is directly associated with better outcomes
    after tPA and endovascular therapy, with a time window of 4.5 hours and 24 hours
    for these treatments, respectively. Despite massive public health campaigns, identifying
    symptoms of stroke and activating emergency response systems remains a major challenge.
    The goal of this project is to develop and test a wearable and computational solution
    to effectively alert ischemic stroke victims and initiate emergency response in
    a timely manner. The solution will consist of a wearable device with multiple
    modalities, which are fed to a smartphone and a cloud-based analysis system for
    real-time analysis and detection. Once deployed, the device is expected to dramatically
    improve stroke emergency response and increase the number of patients receiving
    IV tPA and other reperfusion therapies.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will result from enabling self-evolving telecommunication networks to ensure that reliable and high-speed internet access is available in large metropolitan areas and mission critical applications in smart cities will receive guaranteed Quality of Service, while the capital and operational costs of the networks are reduced. Furthermore, this technology will reduce the energy consumption of telecommunication networks by moving resources where and when they are needed, avoiding over-provisioning and waste in idle resources.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project develops a first of its kind novel Artificial Intelligent-based network performance and demand prediction platform to guarantee 5G connectivity in metropolitan areas and eventually in smart cities. With 68% of the world population living in urban areas by 2050, constant movement of people and diversity in 5G applications network requirements, network optimization is critical. However, achieving optimal network configuration requires accurate prediction of future network demand. The proposed research will utilize the external contextual data of mass human movement and their activity along with a portfolio of machine learning methodologies to perform accurate network demand prediction and consequently optimal resource allocation. The main objective of this project is to develop and deploy an automated cloud-based software that performs prediction on network key performance indicators in urban areas up to seven days in advance. This software solution enables network operators to identify and anticipate accurate temporal and spatial demands and anomalies, understand the factors that will cause demand variations, and pinpoint future opportunities for optimization based on this information.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project includes use of image analysis to provide decision support to parents, clinicians and caregivers in various pediatric health conditions. In a recent survey in 2016, 79% of mothers were interested in trying or learning about telemedicine for non-emergency medical issues and 40% of those owning smartphones have downloaded at least one health or wellness app. Given the current growth potential of mHealth and its high acceptance by parents, a mobile app is perfectly situated to bridge the gap in pediatric care. In this project image analysis will be used to enable real-time decision support, customized recommendations, and low cost scaling up of the technology. The current focus of the project is on characterizing infant head malformations, more specifically flat head syndrome. Even though flat head syndrome is a common condition among infants, there is little awareness among parents about this condition and other health conditions closely related, e.g. torticollis, and developmental delay. Through early identification and patient-specific repositioning recommendations, the proposed technology will significantly lower the number of severe cases that need intensive therapies, and the associated diagnostic and treatment costs.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop algorithms and tools that accurately calculate head shape parameters used in diagnosis and treatment planning for flat head syndrome. Moderate to severe flat head syndrome affects 20-30% of infants in the first few months after birth. If left untreated, it can cause physical and psychological discomfort, and developmental delays. A customized app will acquire photos of the infant's head, assess the shape of the head, and then recommend infant-specific re-positioning instructions. The app will follow up with parents on a regular basis to ensure compliance and therapeutic progress through monitoring. The information will also be sent to the infant's electronic health records for review by the infant's pediatrician. The developed algorithms will also differentiate between flat head syndrome and craniosynostosis, a condition that may cause similar head malformations, but can lead to more serious and permanent health complications including damage to the brain. In addition, the longitudinal dataset, collected by parents through the app, can be used to generate an infant's head growth patterns, and thus monitor development and enable early identification of the infant's risk of other health conditions.

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to address a systematic behavioral health and
    substance use provider shortage, cost-effectively improve patient retention in
    treatment, and proactively treat chronic behavioral health patients. Left untreated,
    these conditions cost over $1 trillion annually and result in countless early
    deaths. Peer support is an effective tool to engage patients unwilling or unable
    to access clinical care, particularly in marginalized populations.  However, scaling
    peer support is challenging, with current online support forums rife with trolling
    and abuse. Our Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools can extrapolate the emotional
    sentiment of text messages, automatically flagging clinically relevant or critical
    content. This allows clinicians to easily moderate groups by focusing their time
    on the patients most in need, while peers generate the touchpoints necessary for
    day-to-day engagement.\n \nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase

    of patients within a support group. Currently, a challenge in managing peer groups
    is identifying the health of a group as a whole - some groups can be far more
    constructive than others. Given the volume of messages generated in an online
    support group, together with expected caseloads for care manager and peer support
    specialists, who may be managing dozens of groups, this is an impossible task
    without the aid of technology. To achieve this goal we focus on three main areas:
    1) improving the performance of our existing NLP algorithms by developing novel
    techniques to identify and track multiple conversations that might be co-occurring
    in the group, 2)  developing a method of tracking the overall health and stability
    of a group by analyzing interactions among peers and 3) design new interfaces
    that effectively display all of the insights generated by the algorithms. These
    NLP tools will power a platform to give patients more access to support. Providers
    will have access to a novel high-fidelity data source to better triage outreach
    and personalize care.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is significant. Based on the company's experience
    with the willingness of farmers to pay for such services, the potential commercial
    market for the envisioned solution for coffee alone would amount to USD 1 billion,
    based on the estimated 27 million acres currently in production around the world.
    \ The commercial potential for additional specialty crops would exceed several
    times this amount. The company's agronomy team believes that the proposed solution
    would result in yield improvements of the order of 5% to 10% and a reduction in
    combined fertilizer and water costs in the range of 3% to 8%.  Moreover, the solution
    would result in higher-quality coffee beans which would improve the commercial
    viability of small coffee farms in emerging economies. This would have the potential
    of lifting hundreds of thousands of sub-tropical farmers and their families out
    of poverty while sustainably protecting soil and water resources.  Precision agriculture
    techniques developed in this project will also enable coffee producers to address
    the effects of climate change by identifying destructive patterns and prescribing
    effective ways to maintain or improve yield and quality. \n\nThis Small Business
    Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop novel deep learning
    algorithms and computer vision methods for coffee and for specialty crops in general,
    and thereby identify, through analysis, signatures of critical coffee tree stress
    conditions.  To date, image analysis algorithms developed in academia typically
    focus on lab environments or controlled research plots. The tasks outlined in
    this project focus on real world coffee orchards with more demanding conditions.
    \ Challenges from the imagery point of view include managing the effects of clouds
    and the sun angle on the canopy, capturing tree foliage at an angle and identifying
    individual trees.  Challenges from the deep learning area include identifying
    with confidence anomalous areas of stress or increasing stress for varying coffee
    strains, soil and topographical conditions within the orchard using multispectral
    and thermal imagery.  From an agronomy standpoint, the project will seek to assist
    and/or correlate the deep learning findings with soil moisture sensors and other
    ground truth data.  These elements will form the core of a low-cost commercial
    remote sensing and alerting system that is expected to be available to coffee-growing

    of Mars and the Moon. \n\nThe proposed project will develop two innovations which
    can enable mass production of thin Si solar cells for aerospace applications.
    There are two main roadblocks for using thin Si solar cells commercially. First,
    is that efficiency of thin silicon cells drops by 4-6%. Second, is that 10-micron-thick
    Si wafers cannot be manufactured using standard Si solar cell fabrication methods.
    Regher Solar has developed two innovations to enable mass production of thin Si
    cells with >20% efficiency. The first innovation is processing of 10-micron-thick
    on thicker Si wafers to use them for handling. The second innovation is using
    silicon heterojunction technology with copper metallization, which achieves the
    highest efficiency when the cell is only 10 microns thick. The overall goal of
    this SBIR proposal is to develop lower cost, high efficiency, flexible, reliable
    and manufacturable solar cells based on thin Si technology for the rapidly growing
    market of solar powered aerospace devices. The specific goals of this Phase I
    project are: (1) finalize a process flow, (2) achieve >22% AM0 efficiency, >2000
    W/kg specific power, >200 W/m2 power density on a 10-micron-thick wafer; (3) conduct
    a comprehensive reliability testing of thin Si solar cells; (4) demonstrate flexible
    blankets.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy
    of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
    impacts review criteria."

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to address
    the power problem, which significantly limits the deployment and functionality
    of next generation wireless sensors and internet-of-things (IoT) nodes and inhibits
    their impact on energy and efficiency savings in the most needed areas of smart
    manufacturing, smart transportation, and building automation. Most high-impact
    IoT applications typically require miniaturization and placement of wireless sensor
    nodes in hard-to-service locations in vast numbers, where the battery replacement
    or electrical wiring is not practical or too costly. This research and development
    effort will explore the fundamental and technological limits of vibration energy
    harvesters, and development of novel micro vibration energy harvesters with high
    power density, multi-axis operation capability, and wider frequency bandwidth.
    These low-cost micro vibration energy harvesters aim to enable energy-autonomous
    wireless sensor nodes that will open up new markets and high-impact applications
    for self-powered IoT nodes, achieve energy savings and increased efficiency in
    multiple industries due to enabled continuous data gathering, reduce the ecological
    footprint of millions of wasted toxic batteries, and significantly decrease the
    maintenance cost of industrial IoT networks. \n\nThis Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a millimeter-scale vibration energy
    harvester that can provide high power density, multi-axis operation capability
    and sufficiently wide operation bandwidth, as a maintenance-free and low-cost
    renewable power source for next-generation industrial IoT nodes. Existing vibration
    energy harvesters have limited practical applications in real life, as they suffer
    from large size, high-cost, low power density, high operation frequency, and extremely
    narrow frequency bandwidths. Moreover, commercial harvesters can only operate
    at a single vibrational axis and cannot harvest efficiently from complex three-dimensional
    vibration profiles found in real-life applications. This SBIR Phase I project
    will focus on novel device architectures to achieve a high-power density in a
    highly compact device volume and to harvest energy efficiently from low-amplitude
    vibrations along any spatial directions. In addition, new device architectures
    will be investigated to obtain further improved performance and additional functionalities.
    Analytical simulations and finite element analysis will be performed to optimize
    device performance. Prototypes will be fabricated via a proprietary advanced micro
    manufacturing method to obtain high-quality piezoelectric thin films on silicon
    wafers. Fabricated harvester prototypes will be tested at conditions simulating
    target industrial applications.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in the development of a highly biocompatible implant material made from collagen that can be used to treat a variety of medical conditions, including stress urinary incontinence, pelvic organ prolapse, hernias, and orthopedic injuries. Many people suffer from these conditions, but the current treatments are suboptimal. Most current implants for the repair or support of these soft tissue problems are made from polypropylene, which has significant clinical problems, including chronic inflammation and pain. The FDA recently ordered the removal of all synthetic implants for pelvic organ prolapse from sale in the US due to patient safety issues. Stress urinary incontinence affects 22% of women aged 45-64 years, and an estimated 9.2 million women in the US alone will have pelvic organ prolapse by 2050. These women have life-altering disorders, often limiting them from working, caring for their families, exercising, traveling, etc. New technology to safely treat these disorders is urgently needed.  The current project will advance the development of a safe, natural, and effective implant material presently not available to these women. Reimbursement for these procedures under Medicare and private insurance are in place.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to advance the manufacturing of electrocompacted collagen threads which can be used for a variety of medical implants. The existing lab-scale manufacturing process for the production of the collagen threads will be developed into a scaled-up commercial ready process. Key goals include speeding up the thread production, decreasing the need for operator intervention, and improving the efficiency of converting the collagen feedstock into thread, all while maintaining thread strength and process repeatability. This is critical to ensuring that products developed from this technology can be produced in commercial volume and will be priced within existing medical insurance reimbursements. Achieving these goals will greatly de-risk this technology, enabling the attraction of further investment capital and the continuation of product development.

    a variety of Next Generation Science Concepts, such as the Periodic Elements and
    their properties. This is facilitated by a teacher-oriented desktop and VR interface

    in VR activities. By leveraging the use of affordable standalone VR headsets,
    and elevating VR beyond its current one-student-at-a-time use case, the project
    will be pioneering the highly anticipated market of virtual field trips for use
    in authentic learning environments. This is aligned with the National Science
    Foundation's Education Research Area, which seeks to achieve excellence in U.S.
    STEM education at all levels in all settings, because the value of classroom-VR
    rests on its unique ability to provide more effective learning settings to more
    students. \n\nWhat is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity? \n\n\nThe
    project team will develop an immersive multiplayer virtual reality (VR) learning

    the general field of learning games, by applying the Universal Design for Learning
    framework to its local goal of enhancing middle-schoolers' relationships to and
    content knowledge of STEM topics. This permits the project to be a test-bed for
    educational VR content design and interaction schemes. In Phase I research, the
    project team will examine whether students are able to understand how to play
    the game with minimal or no external help, whether teachers can integrate the
    product with their classroom environment, how large of a group a teacher can manage

    to be inherently poor indicators of research quality but are still used for the
    lack of a better alternative. This deficiency costs the public, businesses, and

    The proposed research and the resulting prototype will help a non-expert to evaluate
    scientific claims by automatically extracting classifying statements from scientific
    literature that provide supporting or contradicting evidence. If successful, the
    proposed innovation will encourage reliable research by vastly increasing the
    number of people who can evaluate it soundly, will enable individuals and organizations

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to create a viable control system that will
    optimize microgrids in a decentralized manner and create additional flexibility
    for electric grid operators. Current microgrids' combinations of power generation,
    storage, and consumption that may or may not be integrated with the broader electric
    grid?mostly depend on a centralized dispatch approach, with one single operator
    making decisions regarding which assets to utilize and when. Centralized systems
    require large efforts to set up and do not efficiently adapt to changes in generation
    or consumption. The proposed technology will employ a different logic for controlling
    assets, automatically and continuously optimizing the dispatch decisions by using
    a decentralized blockchain ledger. The benefits of this control system include
    dramatically increased flexibility when assets are added or removed from the system,
    and much greater resiliency as there is no single point of failure of the system.
    Electric utilities will be able to leverage the system to more effectively manage
    the grid and deploy \"virtual power plants\" rather than depend on inefficient
    and costly \"peaker\" plants. Overall the technology will accelerate adoption
    of microgrids, improving the nation's energy infrastructure. \n\nThis Small Business

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable production of high resolution, timely, affordable data on agricultural productivity and economic outcomes across Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where access to demographic and market data is severely limited. The project proposes a set of machine learning methods for extracting objects, like farm fields and housing, from earth observation datasets. There are three key impacts enabled by the proposed technology. First, there are open scientific questions related to the efficient detection of objects in satellite imagery, particularly in rural developing country contexts, where training data are sparse. Second, the project is expected to significantly improve the accuracy of existing models for the prediction of socio-economic outcomes, by generating valuable new model inputs and improving the handling of missing data. Third, it seeks to expand the universe of socio-economic information that can be extracted from satellite imagery, by enabling the prediction of outcomes that previously have not been feasible. The resulting market intelligence products will revolutionize the cost effectiveness of agribusinesses, non-governmental organizations, and governments operating in SSA, enabling them to enter and serve fast-growing consumer markets across the continent.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on developing computationally efficient methods for segmenting images with rich geospatial content. It evaluates a series of deep learning architectures that extract relevant objects from composites of different earth observation datasets. A key technical challenge is designing models that make effective use of satellite imagery that spans multiple spatial resolutions, temporal frequencies, and sensing modalities. This presents unique opportunities and challenges compared to mainstream research on weakly supervised learning in traditional computer vision applications. The project's objectives are to 1) develop and test instance segmentation techniques that leverage the unique spatiotemporal information available in different types of earth observation data; and 2) innovate new learning approaches for handling missing inputs and dealing with sparse training data. Algorithms developed by this project will be evaluated using standard metrics for model performance, leveraging existing household survey data for testing and validation. Downstream benefits of the project include lower-cost access to market intelligence that can unlock underserved markets, expansion of the set of economic indicators that can be derived from earth observation data, and improved targeting of development assistance to people living in emerging economies, enabling cost-efficiencies for donors like USAID.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will address a critical need for a new source of strategic materials for the clean energy and electronics markets. The U.S. is a major consumer of cobalt, a critical component in rechargeable lithium-ion batteries. Over the next five years, the rapid increase in electric vehicles on the road will cause a drastic shift in the market, becoming the largest and fastest growing end-use of this critical material. This projected increase in demand, combined with the unstable global supply and difficulties with scaling mining productions, puts our cobalt supply at high risk. Discarded lithium ion batteries could be a viable secondary source of cobalt if viable recycling technologies were available. Achieving efficient, low-cost recycling of Li-ion batteries will facilitate a secure source of cobalt for our U.S.-based manufacturers with large societal impact, offering a high net-benefit concerning air emissions and climate protection, and incentives for collecting high priority waste. The commercial impact of this technology will enable further innovation for clean energy technologies where humans ability to literally wield power where and when they want it that will not be limited by the availability of critical metals.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will provide a recycling technology for the li-ion battery market, helping to solve the supply crisis for cobalt in the electronics and clean energy sector. Currently, there are no viable alternatives for cobalt separation and capture, except for large, expensive, and energy consumptive hydrometallurgical and pyrometallurgical processes. While these techniques work well, they require high capital and material transportation costs. The technique proposed here provides a new and efficient method for separating and reclaiming cobalt oxide for direct reuse in advanced manufacturing, designed with a small footprint so that it can be added onto existing recycling and manufacturing processes to capture these metals, without large upfront capital cost. The research objectives of this SBIR project will demonstrate feasibility of recovering cobalt from Li-ion battery waste using a plug-and-play, high-throughput electrochemical deposition method. To achieve this, we will utilize high surface area, flexible carbon material to enhance the selectivity and efficiency of our process. The anticipated technical results include a 5-10x reduction in cost and 1-4x reduction in CO2 emissions compared to incumbent recycling technologies, ultimately redefining our current wastes as resources, providing a secure source of cobalt to the U.S. market.

    is to reduce the time required to construct concrete bridges, improve job site
    safety relating to rebar installation, reduce costs related to bridge construction,
    and improve the overall health of ironworkers. Ironworkers face some of the highest
    rates soft tissue damage of the industrial occupations due the constant bending

    time for bridges, communities will be able to recover from natural disasters at
    a faster pace. These benefits will be accomplished by automating the process of
    the tying rebar. This is significant due to the highly repetitive nature of the
    tying process, the labor shortages in the construction industry, and the fact
    that rebar tying often sits on the critical path of a concrete pour. To automate
    rebar tying, a drone platform with an integrated tie tool, specialized flight
    controls, and navigation system will be developed. This will take small unmanned
    aircraft systems (sUAS) from observation roles to a manipulation platform. Rebar
    tying on bridges represents a $275 million market over the next 10 years and $1.7
    billion market annually across the USA for the larger general construction market.
    \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop
    a sUAS capable of tying the rebar for concrete construction on an outdoor fixture.
    This will represent the first commercially viable aerial manipulation system if
    the project is successful. A combination of computer vision, machine learning,
    and sensor fusion techniques will be employed to develop an autonomous system
    capable of allowing a drone to identify, land and tie with a high level of accuracy
    to enable rebar tying. Modification to the autopilot will be conducted to allow
    the drone to trigger the integrated rebar tool. Computer vision algorithms will
    be optimized and ported to run onboard the sUAS. A control system for visual servo-ing
    will be developed to utilize onboard computer vision algorithms and other sensors
    to track and land on rebar intersections accurately. High-level challenges consist
    of uncovering the robustness of existing rebar tool towards imprecise landing,
    improving landing precision, improving accuracy of rebar intersection detection,
    and visual servo-ing of the drone.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a swarm 3D printing and assembly (SPA) platform via the cooperation of multiple 3D printers and assembly robots. The SPA platform provides a new approach for faster and affordable large-size printing with multiple materials. It addresses several major barriers (e.g., limited printing capability and scalability, relatively high cost) for the adoption of 3D printing for business or personal use and provides commercial opportunities in different industries, such as architecture and construction. The ultimate vision of the project is to develop a model of a generic digital factory with autonomous mobile robots. This factory model can be replicated in communities around the world to create a network of smart factories as a digital manufacturing infrastructure such that on-demand, customized manufacturing becomes affordable. Similar to how the infrastructure of the electricity grid and the Internet transformed society, this envisioned digital manufacturing infrastructure will make it easier and more economical for product designers and entrepreneurs to bring new products to market without being discouraged by the complexity and cost of production and supply chain management.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to expand current 3D printing capabilities with a swarm 3D printing and assembly platform (SPA). SPA synergistically integrates 3D printing techniques with swarm robotics, thus effectively addressing the issues pertaining to print time, print cost and print quality - the three objectives that current 3D printing technologies cannot simultaneously achieve. The primary intellectual merit of this project lies in a new approach to realizing cooperative 3D printing and manufacturing between multiple independent 3D printers and robots, which provides a modular and reconfigurable digital manufacturing platform. In this project, we propose a new hardware platform based on a novel mobile 3D printer with a Selective Compliance Assembly Robot Arm (SCARA) and a new software to coordinate multiple mobile 3D printers and assembly robots. This enables multi-color and multi-material printing, as well as integration of pre-manufactured components into print jobs. The anticipated technical outcome is an integrated SPA system that is capable of printing large-scale objects while assuring print quality comparable to current small-scale commercial 3D printers.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this STTR Phase I project is the commercialization of next-generation lithium-ion battery materials and their integration into the current battery manufacturing infrastructure. Specifically, the development of drop-in functionality and roll-to-roll processing pathways for advanced coating technology will demonstrate its potential for facile integration with existing commercial battery production lines. The graphene-based coating innovation also has the potential to accelerate the market adoption rate of novel, high-performance lithium-ion battery materials and advance the current trajectory for energy storage capabilities to meet increasingly rigorous societal demands for electrification (e.g., electric vehicles). In addition, the successful commercialization of this graphene-based technology for a high-value application such as lithium-ion batteries will further validate the commercial potential of graphene and invigorate its growing market. Finally, since the current list of major battery manufacturers is dominated by non-U.S. companies, this proposal presents a clear opportunity for emerging domestic technology to enhance technical competitiveness of the U.S. in the green energy sector through the development of novel energy storage solutions and advanced manufacturing innovations.

    This STTR Phase I Project proposes research activities that will demonstrate how graphene-based coating technologies can advance to yield powders of emerging cathode materials in large scale with uniform conformal coatings that maximize their performance. The resulting innovation will be a unique nanomaterial-based additive that can be seamlessly integrated into existing manufacturing processes and facilitate commercialization of next-generation lithium-ion batteries in emerging applications from drones to electric vehicles. This development effort concurrently explores the scalability and applicability of the graphene-based coatings as a protective additive solution to address key technical issues facing experimental battery active materials, which have significantly higher theoretical energy density than state-of-the-art but suffer from chemical instability, high cell impedance, and poor packing density issues. The overarching goals of the proposed research activities are to develop: (1) a scalable production approach for a library of novel cathode nanoparticles for high energy density and maximized rate capability; (2) a scalable production method of applying uniform conformal graphene-based coatings on cathode nanoparticles; (3) an optimized slurry and electrode formulation for the nanostructured cathode particles from the combined efforts of objectives (1) and (2), which will guide cell fabrication efforts toward industry-format battery prototypes.

    Research (SBIR) Phase I Project is to provide the pharmaceutical industry with
    improved pre-clinical screening assay for oral drug absorption. Current in vitro
    methods for characterizing gastrointestinal absorption are based on unreliable
    assays, with 90% of all drugs developed ultimately failing to enter the market.
    Practically, these limitations delay the development of critically needed therapeutic
    drugs and dramatically increase drug prices and health care costs. There is, therefore,
    a critical need to develop more predictive in vitro testing assays that will allow
    for early selection of the most promising drug candidates to reduce the number
    of live animal studies and their associated costs, while accelerating transition
    from pre-clinical research to early drug development. The technology is based
    on the discovery, fundamental characterization and bioarchiving of adult canine
    intestinal stem cell lines, called 3-dimensional (3D) canine intestinal organoids.
    These miniguts emulate the physiology of the functional intestine much more closely
    than currently available methods and have the potential to provide superior drug
    screening over currently used assays. \n\nThis SBIR Phase I is a proposal to establish
    that in vitro predictability of oral drug absorption can be improved using canine
    intestinal organoids vs. standard 2D in vitro assays, such as Caco2 and MDCK cell
    lines. In Aim 1, the goal is to determine intestinal absorption and permeability
    of therapeutic drugs as a function of disease and intestinal segment as compared
    with conventional in vitro models. This will be achieved by quantifying passive
    and active permeability of drugs, as well as drug transporter expression and function
    in 3D canine organoids vs. conventional cell systems. In Aim 2, the goal is to
    determine intestinal metabolism of therapeutic drugs as a function of disease
    and intestinal segment in canine organoids compared to standard in vitro models.
    Ultimately, quantitative data generated through these experiments will be imported
    into a commercial software to simulate the disposition kinetics of a predefined
    set of candidate drugs. Performances of the model predictions will be evaluated
    by comparing simulated vs. observed drug kinetic plasma data from the literature
    for validation purposes.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this SBIR Phase I project is significant since the platform is an enabler of a range of high-speed wireless applications for the next generation of broadband communications. The proposed technology platform will solve some of the key challenges of millimeter-wave (MMW) wireless radios and networks and can serve a wide set of wireless related applications and markets, particularly the telecommunication backhaul and fixed wireless access markets, among others. This Radio Frequency (RF) front-end system, integrated with the base-band circuitry in a wireless module, provides the hardware necessary to enable the vision of a truly fiber-speed backhaul network for 10s of millions of 5th generation (5G) cell deployments to provide the ultimate network robustness, agility, with significant cost savings for the operators and businesses. This advanced wireless technology will enable rapid and robust roll-out of the next generation network as well as a wide range of broadband wireless applications and can play a pivotal role in overall pace of 5G technology penetration. This in turn will impact many industry sectors, ranging from smart transportation, manufacturing, and healthcare to smart city, and the Internet of Things.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop an ultra-high performance MMW wireless RF front-end technology for the next generation of multi-gigabit applications. Driven by the rising demand of the data-intensive applications, there is a growing need for more advanced wireless equipment for high data-rate communications. That is why with the emergence of multi-gigabit applications, there is a significant focus on MMW technology as the frontier of the wireless communication. The existing MMW RF front-end technologies, however, are either limited in their functionality or suffer from high power-consumption, which makes them not suitable for emerging massive deployments such as 5G backhaul, last-mile broadband for enterprise and service providers, etc. As a result, there is a need for new MMW RF front-end technologies to unlock the full potential of fiber-speed wireless communications. The proposed technology offers an order of magnitude higher performance compared to the best-in-class wireless technologies and can serve as an enabler to multiple high-speed applications.

    (SBIR)Phase I project directly addresses the scope of Asthma in the United States.
    Respiratory specialists say they are in a quandary in their attempts to obtain
    definitive diagnoses of lung diseases because they lack a reliable pulmonary functions
    test device that can be used on all patients and have a high degree of accuracy.
    \ Spirometry has a long list of shortcomings that are well known, and the specialists
    are asking  for a better device.  A growing body of international research, that
    includes ten plus years of NIH studies, is showing that impulse oscillometry is
    the most accurate PFT for respiratory diseases and that it can often worsening
    lung status several days before symptoms appear.   The overall costs of asthma
    alone in the U.S. are estimated to be approximately $56 billion a year.  Much
    of this is attributed to the fact that maintaining asthma control in a patient
    is difficult to do without frequent objective measurement.  Losing control leads
    to increased asthma exacerbations, ER visits, hospitalizations, lost work and
    school days, and higher medical costs.  Having an easy to use and clinically accurate
    pulmonary functions test device is the key element in this process.  \n\nThis
    Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project has a revolutionary
    design that incorporates the advanced technology of impulse oscillometry into
    a handheld and cost effective medical device that fulfills the lung measurement
    requirements requested by respiratory specialists during our customer discovery
    process.  The core of IOS methodology is that gentle impulses of air are pulsed
    into the lungs of a patient via their normal tidal breathing.   The low frequency
    impulses pass through the central lungs, travel throughout the peripheral lungs
    (resistance) and rebound back to the IOS device (reactance).  The differences
    between the resistance and reactance pressures are then measured and analyzed,
    revealing the extent of the obstruction in the peripheral airways.  Test data
    from each device is automatically sent to a secure cloud server where it is analyzed
    and compared to other demographically similar patients.  The analyzed results
    are then transmitted to a proprietary application on the patient's smartphone,
    the caregiver's smartphone, and to the patient's primary care manager electronic
    medical record.  The home version of the device will allow objectively measured
    pulmonary status to be remotely and frequently measured, and automatically sent
    to the provider.  This is the breakthrough that the Asthma community has long
    needed.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project is to develop low-cost, high-performing feed additives for the swine feed market.  Some of the current additives that supplement feed have detrimental side effects and/or made from raw materials that are considered toxic. Additives made from these toxic raw materials need to undergo substantial purification to meet the safety thresholds. This project will develop new enzymes and processes that enable the synthesis of chemically and structurally identical additives from renewable feedstocks. The combination of enzyme design and process optimization will result in an environmentally-friendly process to produce additives that require minimal purification and result in low production costs. The goal is to develop novel enzymes that are suited to produce feed additives that have a proven record of safety and efficacy.

    This STTR Phase I project is a proposal to address the availability of renewably-sourced feed additives by developing a new enzyme and a process. Currently, many feed additives are produced using organic chemical synthesis that require energy intensive unit operations. The required extensive clean-up of these products, combined with the high containment cost, translates into high operating expenses. This project will focus on developing new catalytic capabilities for enzymes by improving their selectivity and specificity. Using the newly engineered enzymes in a process that involves efficient unit operations, it will be possible for the first time to produce low-cost feed additives that have a proven history of performance and safe use. By employing powerful enzyme design tools to create enzyme libraries through gene synthesis, this project will screen for promising enzyme candidates that have desired capabilities. The deliverable of the Phase I project will be a conclusive demonstration of the technical, economic and market feasibility of the concept.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable safer and more economical nuclear power.  This project will help increase the safety of nuclear power plants by reducing radiation damage to reactor components and reducing radiation exposure to power plant workers and personnel.  In addition, it will reduce overall plant life cycle costs by reducing the cost of spent fuel management and decommissioning.  By these means, this project will support the public benefit from continued and expanded use of nuclear power as a clean energy source.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project goal is to reduce the thermal expansion properties of a lightweight, high-temperature neutron shielding material.  The key value proposition provided by this material over existing products is the unique increase in the operating temperature without producing a notable increase in weight or reduction in neutron stopping power. However, to enable its practical use, the material must be further adapted to reduce the coefficient of thermal expansion to meet reactor design requirements.  With success, the proposed project will overcome the technical hurdle of reducing the coefficient of thermal expansion without altering other key material properties such as neutron stopping power, radiation resistance, density, and maximum operating temperature.  Three approaches applied separately and in combination, if necessary, will be explored for reducing the coefficient of thermal expansion.  These strategies may also be applicable for reducing the coefficient of thermal expansion in other neutron shielding materials with design limitations.

    This SBIR Phase I project aims to develop an anti-cancer vaccine. A successful vaccine against cancer can potentially revolutionize cancer treatment and prevention by providing durable protection to patients and preventing relapse, without the harmful side effects commonly associated with chemo- and radiation- therapies. One of the major challenges in anti-cancer vaccine development is the low immunogenicity of cancer antigens, in particular tumor associated carbohydrate antigens. In order to overcome this, in this project, a new carrier system based on bacteriophage Qbeta will be developed. A representative carbohydrate antigen GD2 will be linked with bacteriophage Qbeta, which can elicit superior titers of antibodies that can kill cancer cells. Successful commercial development of such vaccines will greatly benefit cancer patients not only in the US, but also throughout the world. In addition to cancer vaccines, the bacteriophage Qbeta based carrier is a new platform technology to elicit powerful antibody responses. Biotechnological companies interested in vaccine development can adapt Qbeta as the carrier to target infectious diseases and chronic diseases. Furthermore, the Qbeta platform can provide an excellent starting point for the generation of monoclonal antibodies, which are among the top agents developed for therapeutics and diagnostics. Thus, the availability of a superior carrier can potentially address a wide range of biomedical needs.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to design new bacteriophage Qbeta based carriers for next generation vaccines. Vaccines have had tremendous impacts on public health. Traditional vaccines commonly incorporate attenuated or killed bacteria or viruses as immunogens. With the enhanced requirements on safety, the field is focusing more on well-defined subunits as epitopes for vaccine design. As subunits tend to have lower immunogenicity, immunogenic carriers are critical to deliver the desired antigen to the immune system and to enhance the immune responses. However, there are only a few carriers available that have been validated in clinical studies. The limited choices of carriers can significantly reduce vaccine efficacy due to interferences from anti- carrier antibodies. This project develops a new class of immunogenic carrier based on bacteriophage Qbeta capable of eliciting superior levels of IgG antibodies to the target antigen compared to gold standard carrier proteins. Novel mutants of Qbeta will become available to elicit high levels of IgG antibodies against the target antigen. The utility of the new Qbeta carrier will be demonstrated in delivering a tumor associated carbohydrate antigen, i.e., ganglioside GD2 derivative, to induce potent anti-cancer IgG antibodies. When successful, the GD2 based vaccine will be a quantum leap for the field as it will be the first ever carbohydrate based anticancer vaccine.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project consists of (1) preventing server-level data breaches; and (2) increasing adoption of cloud computing; especially in sectors that inherently deal with sensitive data and are subject to regulation. This includes the healthcare and finance industries as well as government agencies. Data breaches are occurring at an alarming rate and affecting every industry and sector of government. This project enables customers to search and query data without ever needing to decrypt it, effectively protecting data against server-level breaches. Potential customers from the financial and healthcare industries said in interviews that their adoption of cloud computing had been slowed due to the sensitivity of some of their data. Their inability to use the cloud to store and analyze highly sensitive data is very costly since they have to build and maintain on-premise infrastructures to handle it. The outcome of this project will enable customers to make use of and benefit from cloud computing even for their most sensitive data. From a societal standpoint, this project increases user security and privacy and helps achieve regulatory compliance while investing less in cybersecurity.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to design, build and evaluate a commercially viable encrypted relational database system. The project will tackle a variety of technical challenges that need to be overcome before this technology can see widespread adoption. The first is integration with existing database management systems (DBMSs). Commercial database systems benefit from over 40 years of research, optimization and engineering breakthroughs. While the new cryptographic techniques proposed for this project have many advantages in terms of security and efficiency, it is not a-priori clear how to integrate them into a standard DBMS without a complete re-design. To address this challenge, this project leverages a new algorithmic paradigm called emulation that seamlessly integrates these new cryptographic techniques with standard commercial DBMSs. The second challenge this project addresses is concrete real-world efficiency. The theoretical analysis of the proposed solution shows that it is asymptotically efficient. The proposed work, however, will show that it is also efficient in practice on real data and against real database benchmarks.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of origami-inspired mechanical metamaterials.  These techniques can generate tessellated patterns that augment and enhance common materials.  With the capacity for simultaneously making conventional materials lighter, stronger, and multi-functional, this material design motif has the potential to impact a wide range of technologies in hardware, manufacturing, energy-efficiency, robotics, and aerospace.  This potential can be tapped by embedding carefully designed geometric patterns into materials.  The current unmet challenge for realizing this potential impact is the conspicuous absence of a standard library of metamaterial designs.  This project addresses the challenge by exploring the feasibility of a complete kinematic set and to determine whether the resulting physical properties are suitable for broader engineering applications.  If successful, the metamaterials designed and validated by this effort will lay the foundation for replacing, augmenting, or enhancing machines of all types with mechanical metamaterial-based technology.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project utilizes an artificial intelligence-enhanced optimization scheme to automatically generate mechanical metamaterial designs meeting user-defined target properties.  To generate the proposed set of kinematically-complete mechanical metamaterials the software-based approach to metamaterial design will be required to mesh with empirical validations.  A combination of supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques will be used to guarantee the metamaterial designer routinely generates useful, robust, and high-performing schematics that qualitatively and quantitatively improve as the pipeline for metamaterial design is repeatedly executed.  The core algorithm improves the ability to produce high-impact metamaterial-based technology while taking less time to converge on optimized design schematics. As such, the barrier to market penetration of advanced material technology becomes lower, faster, and is driven by advances in machine learning.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the ability for both companies and municipalities to more quickly and easily find insights inside their large geospatial datasets.  Existing 2D-based tools have struggled to keep up with the demands of modern datasets.  Within the targeted industries, the result of this project will accelerate the deployment of next-generation 5G networks, help improve situational awareness during capacity and emergency planning, and allow for the real-time monitoring of large-scale infrastructures like utility grids.  Additionally, local, state, and federal governments will gain a greater understanding of their data with minimal additional training or staffing costs, leading to more effective and impactful policy decisions.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses three critical challenges faced when working with geospatial data: volume, variety, and accessibility. Geospatial information is often bulky and created faster than it can be processed.  Further, GIS data comes in many different formats that aren't inherently compatible and is siloed so much that collaboration is difficult.  The objective of this research is to enhance a non-technical person's ability to search for, find, and communicate insights.  Specifically, this project fuses immersive display technologies with advanced visualization techniques to form a new type of data experience.  Using virtual reality, a user will be able to load large, complex geospatial datasets and explore them naturally.  The anticipated technical result will be a proof-of-concept application that allows someone to literally step inside their data, discover hidden meanings, and invite others to share the same experience and takeaways.

    This SBIR Phase I project addresses the problem of assessing blood clotting and associated bleeding and thrombosis risks in neonatal and pediatric patients. Existing coagulation analyzers put these patients at further risk because they cannot operate with low volumes of blood, and because they are less reliable owing to the requirement for test sample contact. This project will develop Acoustic Tweezing Thomboelastometry (ATT) for these patients.  Using only a single acoustically-levitated drop of blood, this non-contact technology platform enables safe and reliable assessment of blood clotting in small children and provides an opportunity for development of newborn screening tests for coagulation abnormalities. This technology is the outcome of NSF funding which has supported the training of several PhD students in biomedical and mechanical engineering.  ATT can reduce side effects for neonatal and pediatric patients by using 1/100th the sample volume required by technologies developed for adult healthcare and improve diagnostic response time for critical care providers by up to 350%. This technology could decrease the cost of blood coagulation analysis by over 30%, thus allowing for patients in the United States to save $2.0 billion annually.

    This SBIR Phase I project develops an innovative technology for non-contact blood coagulation analysis that integrates photo-optical and viscoelastic measurements in a single drop of blood (<6uL in volume).  The essence of the ATT technology is to levitate a small sample in a host fluid (e.g., air) by the acoustic radiation force and measure its physical properties under deformation during levitation.  ATT addresses the issue of high variability and poor standardization of existing coagulation analyzers caused by blood sample contact with artificial surfaces. Due to its noncontact feature and low sample volume requirement, ATT can rapidly (<10 minutes) and reliably assess bleeding/thrombotic risks and is sensitive to temporal changes in shear viscosity and elasticity during blood clotting and fibrinolysis.  In addition, ATT can measure platelet function and assess the functional levels of fibrinogen and other coagulation factors. The goal of this project is to develop a user-friendly minimal marketable product for the market of pediatric coagulation analyzers. This goal will be achieved by meeting the following three objectives: 1) build the user-friendly prototype; 2) develop integrated software for device control, data acquisition, and data analysis; and 3) calibrate the prototype and standardize it for coagulation measurements.

- abstractText: "This Small Technology Transfer Phase I project will realize a sensorized
    soft robotic hand exoskeleton coupled with an interactive 3D virtual reality (VR)
    gaming environment that provides fine motor training for stroke patients' hands.
    There is a currently a lack of available devices that provide fine sensory and
    motor training of the hand. The potential benefit is to fill this niche market
    opportunity, especially when considering the high incidence of hand disability
    due to stroke and other neuromusculoskeletal injuries. This system can provide
    structured therapy sessions which requires minimal therapist supervision while
    improving patient engagement which enhances the broader participation. As a complimentary
    technology for current rehabilitation practice, it has a potential to lower health
    care and labor costs associated with neurological rehabilitation. The outpatient
    physical rehabilitation market is a $30 billion industry growing at a rate of
    7% in the US, mainly due to the growing elderly population. The robot-assisted
    rehabilitation market is expected to grow dramatically, reaching $2 billion by
    2020. As robot-assisted treatment becomes widely available, the customer base
    will grow from acute care clinics to long-term rehabilitation centers and finally
    to home-based care. \n\nThe intellectual merit of this project results from the
    combination of a soft robotic system with fine motor control synced to VR games
    for both sensory and motor stimuli. The robotic exoskeleton provides individual
    joint control to practice complex grasping while the VR environment provides targeted
    rehabilitation games. This system addresses the fine motor control needs that
    have not been met by current hand rehabilitation devices, which only offer gross
    motions. Adaptive algorithms will adjust to the patient's level of ability to
    accomplish the assigned tasks in virtual game scenarios, providing accessibility
    for a wide range of population with different levels of severity. There are three
    main goals for the project. First, we will develop a VR environment simulating
    real-world hand motion via interaction with objects in an immersive game. Second,
    we will develop adaptive control algorithms for the soft robotic exoskeleton to
    provide active assistive motion in performing rehabilitation-oriented tasks in
    the VR environment. Third, a pilot study will be conducted with both healthy individuals
    and hand-impaired stroke patients. The Phase I project will produce a system with
    assistive hand motion in a targeted rehabilitation virtual game environment, which
    can be tested for efficacy in a larger clinical population of stroke survivors.\n\nThis

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase I project lays in its ability to enable reconfigurable hardware acceleration in the Internet-of-Things (IoT). Users under constrained power at the edge will be able to choose a new solution that can bring acceleration, and enable datacenter like capabilities, and benefit from the IoT's long-sought promise.  Using Resistive Random-Access Memory (RRAM) to develop a next-generation Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), increasing performance while reducing energy consumption at the sensor node level, is possible. As already experienced in our data driven world, it is critical that we improve our computing capabilities at the edge in order to gain in responsiveness and increase our energy efficiency. With evermore data and performance requirements to deliver on the consumer demands, innovative uses of emerging memories are showing great promise and providing capabilities that will help fulfill the IoT's potential. If fulfilled, this technology has the potential to enable a whole set of data driven applications at the edge, such as low-energy image recognition and learning in drones to operate longer and more effectively or long-lasting medical implants with leading data aggregation and reactiveness.

    This Small Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase I project will aim to commercialize a patented technology to realize a ultra-low-power Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) based on Resistive Random-Access Memory (RRAM). To handle the data explosion in Internet of Things (IoT) network, the industry is moving towards increasing intelligent analysis capability for single IoT devices. Tight power budget has become a critical road block: high-end solutions, such as multicore CPUs, GPUs, can provide enough computing capability but fail to meet the power budget, while low-power commercial products, such as micro-controllers and low-power FPGAs, can satisfy power constraints but hardly follow the increasing complexity in data analysis algorithms. This project aims to develop a ultra-low-power FPGA that can offer high-performance data analysis capability under IoT-level power limits. This project will prototype a FPGA chip built around an innovative RRAM-based routing multiplexer design. We will also release an associated software tool suite to support the implementation of customer's applications on the technology. Compared to existing commercial solutions, the proposed FPGA product is expected to demonstrate similar computing capability as high-end FPGA solutions while satisfying an IoT power budget (<1W).

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to make organizations more productive by helping them organize operational data in a structured yet accessible way. Today, organizations tend to accumulate such data in spreadsheets, scattered across users and folders, with new copies and revisions being made every time data must be presented, summarized, or integrated in a new way. This leads to tedious cut-and-paste workflows, costly errors, and a lack of reliable information for decision support. This project proposes a general-purpose software solution, based on a recently developed method for interactive database visualization. The system's novelty is in the ease and flexibility with which data can be queried and laid out on the screen, covering a large range of use cases that would previously require custom programming. Applications can be found in all manner of organizations: corporations, non-profits, higher education, science, healthcare, journalism, disaster response, the military, public administration, and so on.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a general-purpose, user-friendly software product that individuals within an organization can use to store and share structured data along with the various data displays through which said data is viewed, queried, and edited. Such data displays could include arbitrary database queries, visualizations such as crosstabs, calendars, and bar charts, as well as non-tabular multi-query visualizations such as forms, dashboards, and hierarchical reports. Using the proposed software, organizations can decrease time spent on administrative and managerial tasks, improve the use of data in decision-making, and, in many cases, eliminate yearlong internal software development projects.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will result from the development of quantum computers that will impact many technologies by enabling, for example, molecular simulations for drug design and catalyst development for energy applications, quantum machine learning, and solving optimization problems such as scheduling. Scalable, universal quantum computing promises to be one of the most transformative technologies of the modern era. The range of applications are broad and will only expand with the development of new quantum algorithms, with one of the biggest opportunities being molecular simulations for the chemical and pharmaceutical industries. For example, despite being a multi-billion dollar industry, computational drug discovery is limited by the approximations necessary to make calculations tractable for classical computers. In order to perform these simulations at a scale useful for commercial applications, qubit numbers must be increased several orders of magnitude beyond the state of the art. The proposed innovation of trapping and individual control of neutral atoms will, if successful, enable quantum computers to scale to the thousands of qubits needed for error-corrected, universal quantum computing.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop technology for scalable trapping and addressing of neutral atom qubits through dynamic, parallelized optical trapping and individual addressing of alkaline earth qubits. Neutral atoms are an emerging platform for quantum computing and the majority of work thus far has been directed towards alkali atoms (i.e., those with a single valence electron). Alkaline earth atoms have two valence electrons and correspondingly a richer energy level structure, which has demonstrated very long trapped coherence times.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable the development of monolithic 3D integration of carbon nanotube (CNT) computing in conjunction with silicon nanoelectronics. The value of nanoelectronics utilizing silicon integrated with CNT has been shown to have immense potential through various academic studies. However, the transition of this technology from academia to industry has been stymied by lack of CNT material that meets the manufacturing requirements particularly in terms of alignment, purity, and compatibility to be properly explored. Monolithic 3D integration will enable game-changing levels of improvement to computing speed and power efficiency, creating better computing for all. Providing a material which accelerates research and development for improved computing will create a game changing impact on the $500B integrated circuit market and potentially create billions of dollars in revenue. This project is focused on the needs of the nanoelectronics industry because of the impact possible in that market, but other markets such as biosensing or flexible electronics would benefit from the same materials and often at relaxed specifications.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will greatly expand the utilization of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in nanoelectronics by making industrially relevant material available. This will allow application oriented nanoelectronics teams to move forward with R&D projects. Further, the project's work on the fundamentals of aligned CNT growth and purification will benefit the CNT materials community by the extension of the material into commercial manufacturing. The research objectives are on two fronts: 1) growth of CMOS compatible aligned CNTs and 2) purification of aligned CNTs. Growth of highly aligned CNT populations has typically utilized catalysts which are not compatible with front end of line CMOS fabrication, hindering the use of material in conjunction with Si integrated circuits. Current methods of CNT purification to remove metallic CNTs suffer from either destroying the critical CNT alignment, utilization of non-CMOS compatible materials, or the need of extensive post-processing. This project will develop a growth process and a purification process that preserves alignment while maintaining CMOS compatibility and utilizes wafer scale batch processes that allow high throughput manufacturing. The purification scheme is a proprietary method which must be characterized and refined to meet the exacting purification standards of 99.99% semiconducting CNTs or better.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be the development of a coating product with superior durability and antifouling performance in the targeted environmental-friendly marine coating market. This innovative solution requires a less frequent application and reduces the amount of subaquatic growth on the hull of ships and static objects in bodies of water. Potential economic benefits include improving fuel efficiency and saving the maintenance cost of ships and static marine structures. At the same time, this product provides enormous environmental benefits by reducing the greenhouse gas emission from cargo ships and avoiding the potential species invasion caused by current marine coatings. In particular, this product is the first non-biocide environmentally friendly product of its kind. It addresses the current and future needs highlighted by global regulations to replace the existing harmful biocide-leaching coatings with an eco-friendly solution.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop and commercialize a novel marine coating product to deliver a high-performing eco-friendly antifouling solution that is currently lacking in the marketplace. Current self-polishing coating products were subject to increasing regulatory restriction, while alternative environmental-friendly option such as fouling-release coating suffered low antifouling performance. This novel coating technology potentially achieves the durability and high antifouling performance for targeted marine applications, and the eco-friendly feature without leaching biocide into the aqueous environment. The objective of this project is to explore the key fabrication factors in coating formulation and identify their impacts on the coating stability and antifouling performance. Critical knowledge will be obtained enables the development of prototype product showing year-long reliability and top marine antifouling function.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will result from developing technology to enable enterprise, cloud, academic, and government network operators to cost-effectively scale computer clusters to support the growing demands on these systems. Computer clusters underpin an increasingly broad range of services that businesses, researchers, and society have come to rely on, from machine learning systems to online social media platforms. Companies increasingly use computer clusters to gain a competitive advantage and accelerate product development. Today's networking technologies improve in performance by a factor of two every two years, but the demand placed on cluster computing systems is growing more than twice that fast in some market segments. The technology developed through this project is well-positioned to exceed the cost and performance scaling limitations of current networking technology, enabling business and scientific end-users to find solutions to more complex problems more quickly.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project demonstrates the feasibility of a network interconnect for computer clusters that routes traffic through transparent optical switches. Optical switches remove communication bottlenecks in the network fabric but require fundamental changes in how distributed applications communicate information across the network compared to present-day technologies. The commercial success of the technology depends on its ability to accelerate the execution of common distributed applications while providing the interoperability, reliability, and manageability expected by network operators. This project aims to demonstrate a 2x improvement in the execution speed of network-bound applications compared to today's technologies. The proposed research to reach this goal includes developing and optimizing the software stack necessary to interface commodity applications with the fabric, quantifying the performance of those applications subject to the constraints imposed by optical switching, and optimizing the optical switch design to maximize application performance at a system level.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project are its two intended contributions: it will advance computer vision for navigation and it will create unprecedented opportunity and independence for individuals with visual impairment. 253 million people with blindness or visual impairment around the world experience difficulty to independently navigate in new spaces. The lack of independence directly leads to disadvantages in getting education and joining the workforce. This project, NavigAid,  is aimed at creating a breakthrough spatial intelligence aid offered as a mobile application which will solve spatial tasks from locating objects to identifying paths of navigation, and to generating rich descriptions of the surroundings. Solving this problem will unlock an estimated direct economic benefit of $26B  annually for people with visual impairment around the world, by decreasing the need for human assistance. The main technological innovation of this project, Ally Networks, is a novel neural network architecture that can learn more robust representations than existing models are able to. The robust representations prevent the networks from making mistakes and make them more operable and useful in situations that need high reliability. Ally Networks thus represent a potential breakthrough to the field of computer-vision navigation.


    This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project will introduce a novel spatial intelligence system, NavigAid, to assist individuals with visual impairment in crucial navigation tasks. NavigAid will generate contextually relevant, task-oriented spatial information from smartphone cameras. With NavigAid, users will be able to navigate independently in unfamiliar, complex environments, thus achieving unprecedented mobility. NavigAid will advance assistive technologies by providing unprecedented services, such as locating objects and generating functionally relevant natural language descriptions of complex environments. The core innovation in this project is Ally Networks, a novel neural network architecture that learns robust spatial semantics rather than 2-dimensional representations. This unique multimodal learning strategy is a high-risk endeavour, with broad impact if successful. Large-scale multimodal learning is difficult, and our technique?s success will revolutionize the state of the art: neural network vision will transform from systems that fail in inscrutable ways, to systems that never fail under circumstances in which human vision would not also fail. Key objectives of this project are to 1) develop and validate Ally Networks on benchmarks, 2) develop spatial problem solvers that address the most pressing needs of users with visual impairment, and 3) develop a test suite to evaluate the spatial problem solvers.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to develop an enzyme immobilization platform
    to be used in the production of biopharmaceuticals and other biomanufacturing
    processes to reduce the timeline and cost associated with discovering and manufacturing
    biotherapeutics.  Biopharmaceutical sales have soared in recent years and healthcare
    authorities have increased pressure on pharmaceutical manufacturers to reduce
    the cost of biologics leaving pharmaceutical engineers to focus on reducing bioproduction
    costs.  To accomplish this goal, pharmaceutical companies are aggressively investigating
    continuous processing technologies to reduce the capital and other costs associated
    with biopharmaceutical manufacture. The immobilization platform described in this
    proposal will provide a technology that is compatible with continuous processing
    strategies to reduce the timeline and cost associated with discovering and manufacturing
    biotherapeutics.  In addition, this platform has the potential to reduce the cost
    and increase the efficiency of biomanufacturing processes across several other
    industries including food, leather, and textiles. \n\nThe intellectual merit of
    this SBIR Phase I project is to develop pH responsive immobilized enzymes for
    the production of biopharmaceuticals. There are three key technical challenges
    associated with this project: The immobilized-enzyme must demonstrate pH responsive
    behavior compatible with biologics manufacture (pH 6-7); mass transfer of protein
    substrates must be comparable to the native enzyme; and extended shelf-life of
    the immobilized-enzyme is required for long-term storage. To mitigate these challenges,
    this project aims to covalently bind an enzyme to a pH responsive polymer that
    is formulated to have reversible solubility near neutral pH. The solubility of
    the immobilized-biocatalyst can be tightly controlled within a specified pH range
    allowing for continuous processing and facile purification of the biotherapeutic
    product. Poor mass transfer often results from immobilizing biocatalysts on solid
    supports. These challenges are further exaggerated in bioconjugation reactions
    because the coupling partner, a protein, is generally more affected by sterics
    than small molecules. Therefore, fabrication of the solid support will be explored
    to produce resins of varied size, morphologies, and dissolution properties that
    are compatible with macromolecule functionalization. Additionally, the immobilized
    enzyme generated in this project can be utilized under soluble conditions, which
    combines the positive attributes of both immobilization and soluble enzyme catalysis.
    The final challenge of developing a commercially viable shelf-life of the catalyst
    will be addressed through development of novel drying protocols. Shelf-stable
    immobilized enzymes will be developed so that inventory can be maintained without
    requiring long lead times for catalyst production.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's
    statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
    the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will enable Fortify to provide U.S. manufacturers with a disruptive manufacturing technology to create low-volume tooling parts with order of magnitude reductions in lead times and part price. U.S. manufacturers rely on prototype and low-volume production parts that are currently produced using aluminum soft tooling that need to be precision machined. Prices for these small run parts can reach USD $10,000 or more per tool, depending on complexity, with lead times extending weeks or months. This results in high unit costs when parts are produced in low volumes. Industry data suggests the market for outsourced prototype and low volume injection molded parts with physical dimensions serviceable by Fortify technology may be as large as USD $2.7 Billion.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will enable Fortify to create a thermal competitive advantage to enable customer discovery in the field of low-volume injection molding tooling. Despite the noise in the field of 3D printing, disrupting the injection molding tooling industry has remained elusive due to the lasting need for high strength, thermal stability, fatigue resistance, and smooth mold finish in 3D printed molds. Fortify is uniquely positioned to address these technical challenges by leveraging novel materials, patented manufacturing hardware, and proprietary manufacturing software. Fortify prints ceramic-filled, high-temperature resins that are locally textured by magnetic fields in customized magnetic printers to produce optimum ceramic microstructures designed by Fortify's INFORM software to maximize the thermomechanical performance of the printed parts.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project pertains to the novel production of short-fiber reinforced thermoplastic material applicable to a range of processes, with the added benefit of utilizing  high quality, low cost recycled or recovered fibers. The beachhead application is in a powder-based additive manufacturing system capable of mid-scale manufacturing that can bridge between prototype-stage and capital-intensive injection molded economy-of-scale manufacturing. Such systems can be located in regional production hubs to accelerate new or highly-customizable products to market. The inclusion of the proposed additives in these systems will expand the range of end-product material properties available, and thereby expand the potential client pool for the same platform. Anticipated flow properties of the material will position it as an accessible additive option for other 3D printing technologies as well as the much larger-market of injection molding processing.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project adapts a processing technology that is yet untapped for this application, to produce a composite thermoplastic additive for polymeric powder feedstock 3D printing. This additive is expected to increase stiffness, strength, and thermal stability of the end product, while reducing weight and providing superior handling characteristics during production relative to existing alternatives. The project is focused on identifying process conditions required to produce a nominally conforming product, followed by testing that characterizes the material and handling properties. Results of these tests will be compared against acceptance standards published by the beachhead additive manufacturing system supplier in preparation for inclusion into 3D printed test components.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to develop an alternative source of pharmaceutical heparin using engineered cultured mammalian cells. Heparin is a widely prescribed anticoagulant (blood thinner), critical for surgical operations and for patients that otherwise have risks of blood clotting. Over 300,000 doses are administered per year in the US alone. Currently, heparin is prepared from animal tissues, primarily pig intestines in China, which has regulatory agencies in the US and other countries concerned. For one reason, heparin manufacturing is difficult to regulate in China as evidenced by the heparin adulteration crisis in 2008 that led to allergic reactions and over 250 deaths worldwide. In addition, there is concern that the Chinese pig population will not be able to keep up with the increasing demand. The FDA is considering reintroducing heparin produced from beef cattle as an alternative source, however, bovine heparin is still subject to complications involving animal tissues and it has different anticoagulant properties, which complicates dosing. The current proposal develops cell-based production in which the entire supply chain can be under GMP control and scalable as needed with no dependence on the number and health of an animal population.

    The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase I project is to genetically engineer cells to produce a heparin product that can be manufactured for pharmaceutical use. Cellular production can be entirely under GMP control, and cell engineering provides opportunities to produce heparin with improved properties. A survey of clinicians that use heparin overwhelmingly identified heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) as a serious detrimental side effect. HIT can lead to blood clots, stroke, heart attack and loss of life and limb. Treatment is complicated and expensive. HIT is an allergic reaction caused when heparin binds to a specific protein in the blood called platelet factor 4 (PF4). PF4 binding depends on elements of heparin structure that are not involved in heparin's anticoagulant activities. Through cell engineering, heparin molecules with an altered structure will be produced that have reduced affinities for PF4, while maintaining potent anticoagulant properties. In addition, heparin has demonstrated efficacy in other areas such as inflammation and cancer that are not involved in blood clotting. Through cell engineering, heparin structures also could be tailored for these additional applications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be the development of a new class of high affinity compounds that would be small enough to be delivered into challenging environments such as living cells. Inhibitors of disease-related proteins are central to modern therapeutics across the spectrum of diseases, from cancer to autoimmune diseases, to viral infections, and even to certain hereditary disorders.  Many of these drivers of disease are transcription factors or signal-transduction molecules, yet these proteins are commonly thought of as "undruggable," due to a lack of small pockets for drug binding or due to large protein-protein interaction interfaces. This proposal is aimed at developing an easily screenable library, consisting of DNA-encoded peptidomimetics, whose members have the necessary properties to inhibit these "yet-to-be-drugged" proteins.  Of highest commercial importance, these compounds could address many of the currently "undruggable" molecular drivers of diseases such as cancer and autoimmune disorders.

    The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase I project is to create a DNA-encoded library of constrained peptidomimetic compounds. Current DNA-encoded libraries are primarily limited to small molecules (DNA-encoded chemical libraries; DECLs) or to natural amino acids in the context of translated-protein display (e.g., phage display or mRNA display). In contrast, member molecules of this library will have a much larger binding surface than current small molecules from DECLs, and will be both protease resistant and have a wide range of chemical side chains, unlike the natural peptides from phage display. The goal of this project is to demonstrate the ability to synthesize compounds with conformational rigidity along with parallel DNA encoding.  A library of these compounds could be screened to discover new therapeutic candidates (human and veterinary), life sciences research tools, and heat-resistant diagnostic reagents.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the creation of new fluorescent materials that will provide new color technologies to the paint, polymer, and ink industries. These new materials will overcome the undesirable properties of commercial fluorescent pigments, like a tendency to rapidly fade, give weak color strength, and degrade during processing. Besides giving fabrics, packaging, and toys bright, attractive colors, improvements to fluorescent pigments could change several parts of daily life: Brighter paints and signs could improve road and airport safety. Product designers for next-generation consumer electronics will have a new color palette for their newest gadget. Agricultural scientists would have a new tool to study crop treatments. As a result, success in this research project has the potential to claim a share of the multi-billion dollar colorant market, disrupt expectations around fluorescent pigments, bring new products to consumers, and create high-tech jobs. In addition, this project leverages collaboration with academic partners, supporting science and entrepreneurship education of university students and postdoctoral fellows.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project provides a revolutionary solution to a problem that has haunted chemistry for more than 150 years. Existing fluorescent materials are formulated with pigments that have thinly dispersed colorants, which dilutes their color and makes them susceptible to degradation. This is done by necessity, because fluorescent dyes have a tendency to aggregate, causing unwanted color changes and loss of the fluorescence effect. This solution utilizes a bottom-up "self-assembly" strategy to eliminate aggregation and create stable fluorescent solids that maximize the longevity and boldness of the color. This research will study this novel class of fluorescent pigment to gauge its resistance to fading, improved chromaticity, and material performance in realistic conditions. This will be done by measuring changes to fluorescence intensity and color appearance under natural and laboratory-accelerated weathering conditions, and creating test "products" in the form of paints and polymers. These test materials are expected to have stronger color for longer periods of time while still being amenable to commercial processing techniques. In addition, this project is an opportunity to study the behavior of self-assembling materials inside polymer formulations, which is a new research area with broad scientific and commercial potential.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will result from enabling efficient repeatable computing using commodity technology. While computers should, in principle, operate the same way each time, we have all seen how a program that ran fine yesterday somehow crashes today. Our current computing infrastructure betrays its fundamentally unrepeatable nature in a thousand careless ways, by letting processor and operating system details affect how programs run. Popular computing abstractions like containers and virtual machines improve repeatability, but do not provide any guarantees. This project conducts R&D on a new repeatable container, which provides repeatability for arbitrary programs running inside it. Repeatable containers will allow for reproducible software builds, software testing that runs the same on all machines, and faster software debugging with "one click" reproduction of failures. Repeatable containers reduce software development and QA costs. Repeatable containers can also facilitate archiving software and scientific research, and trustless grid computing.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project involves the development of new container runtime systems that can enforce repeatability with low performance overhead. This project will focus on technical improvements that yield a robust container runtime which can handle a wide range of legacy software that collectively exercises the full range of processor and operating system behaviors. The container will integrate smoothly with both existing container technologies and existing container users, to facilitate easy adoption by software developers. Key technical results will include developing a "fingerprinting" technology to uniquely identify container executions, and a stress-testing methodology to increase confidence that the repeatability guarantee holds.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will lead to broader adoption of newer medical technologies and increased revenue for medical device companies, decreased training costs, and decreased liability from misuse or lack of appropriate training on medical devices. Research has shown that surgical skill is directly related to a variety of patient outcomes, yet there are few tools that can reliably and affordably measure surgical proficiency. Providing objective measurements of surgical proficiency is not enough; the assessment method must also identify areas of difficulty during a task to improve the surgeon's future performance. The proposed innovation is an objective and scalable way to measure procedural competency using head and hand motion-tracking data collected in a surgical simulation and applying novel, deep-learning algorithms to the analysis. By providing surgeons with real-time feedback during training, this project will allow surgeons to rapidly improve training on specialized devices, thus leading to wider adoption of new technology. Adoption of this surgical assessment platform in medical schools and operating rooms across the country will enable an objective assessment of surgical proficiency, thus reducing training time and costs and lowering risk of medical error due to underdeveloped skills.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop an innovative, deep-learning Surgical Training and Assessment Platform to increase the commercial viability of a Virtual Reality (VR) surgical training program. VR surgical training technology holds enormous potential in improving the efficiency of learning by allowing for unlimited practice and rehearsal of surgical procedures; however, without the ability to reliably assess performance, such platforms cannot be used to their full potential. This application will translate the simulation environment into a vehicle for technical skills assessment to prevent trainees from graduating to independent practice without first proving competency in critical areas. The novel, proprietary software algorithms developed in this proposal will allow for the above applications and broad improvements to training efficiency and patient safety through the tracking and analysis of hand and head motion as a surrogate measure for surgical expertise. The Surgeon Assessment Platform will be developed by determining the most vital head and hand motion data to collect and validating the resulting assessment dataset in a small proof-of-concept study, while meeting the challenge of collecting, storing, and analyzing such a large, high-fidelity dataset.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to make talent search faster and much more effective. More specifically, it will aim to make it easier to connect open jobs with the talents of job seekers. The innovation proposed here will redefine job search in a time when the labor market is in major flux, and the technology developed in this project will enable job searching to move far beyond a one-page resume and focus more on the skills needed to succeed in a job. In so doing, the innovation will enable job seekers to find new opportunities that are aligned with their career interests and enable employers to find skilled talent matched to their project needs. Employers using this technology will be able to search for talent according to what they need performed, without necessarily knowing how the task will be performed. Similarly, job seekers will be able to search for jobs that they may not have known existed but are still strongly aligned with their career goals.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a skills-to-tasks matching system that serves as a basis for which worker skills are employed to perform which tasks on the job. Currently, available data on the skill content of occupations does not capture variation across industries, geographies, or over time. Nor does it capture the applicability of a worker's current skills to new workplace tasks, an important consideration for up-skilling and re-training programs. This limitation has left a major source of information asymmetry intact in the 21st century job market, where the most effective talent search strategy remains peer-referrals. This same lack of granularity in available data has limited the effectiveness of policymakers to measure the skills-gap, identify career pathways, and design training programs most needed in their local economies. The research proposed in this project will produce an up-to-date compendium of the skills and work activities that are evolving in the labor market and map the relationships between them. This technology will provide a dynamic and granular view of the labor market and improve the quality of information available to decision-makers in industry, education, workforce development, as well as for the study of the future of work.

    sequestration and storage. \n\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a
    cloud-based application which will use novel machine learning algorithms and deep
    learning image processing techniques to turn large volumes of data into valuable
    parameters used by various industries in their decision-making process.  Built
    on artificial neural network models, minimum viable product version of the new
    application will target the oil and gas market. It will offer a state-of-the-art
    data-driven module for early adopters including special core analysis (SCAL) service
    providers, exploration and production companies, and chemical product suppliers.
    The customized application will introduce a more computationally-efficient alternative
    to SCAL and digital rock technology field (i.e. combined physics-based and imaging
    paradigm) and will accelerate the forecasting process of rock properties. Initially,
    users will be able to calculate one of the most critical properties of the reservoir
    rock, i.e. permeability. Customizing machine learning algorithms developed in
    Phase I for rock permeability estimation to other industries will facilitate entering
    into other markets. Built on Amazon?s AWS cloud service, it will offer a flexible,
    computationally-scalable, on-demand and cost-effective solution to the customers
    by decreasing the upfront and maintenance costs of hardware and software.\n\nThis

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to drive hypertension awareness and control rates around the world, through the availability of low-cost, portable blood pressure monitoring. High blood pressure (BP) is a major cardiovascular risk factor that affects up to 1 billion people worldwide. It is treatable, yet hypertension awareness and control rates are low. Ubiquitous BP monitoring technology could improve hypertension management, but existing devices require an inflatable cuff and therefore do not afford anytime, anywhere measurement of BP. The market for a portable, cuff-less blood pressure monitor is estimated in the tens of billions of dollars. Successful completion of this project via demonstration of measurement accuracy across a broad range of blood pressures will provide the company with a strong position in this large market. Ultimately, the success of this project could translate to much greater awareness and control of hypertension, helping reduce the incidence and burden of cardiovascular disease around the world.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project aims to develop a technology for cuff-less and calibration-free measurement of blood pressure via a button on a smartphone. Existing automated cuff-based monitors are bulky and do not enable anytime, anywhere measurement of BP. The 'oscillometric finger pressing method'is an emerging approach that uses the same measurement principle that is employed by most automatic cuff devices, but instead of inflating a cuff, the user presses his or her finger (and the underlying artery) against a combination of optical and pressure sensors to determine the blood pressure. The objectives of this program are to shrink the current prototype design and validate its accuracy. The proposed R&D plan includes miniaturization of the circuit components to mount them on a single board and optimization of the sensing technology and algorithm to work in a broad range of normotensive and hypertensive individuals. This work will be followed up by a clinical test of the monitor. The resulting device is expected to be small and thin enough to mount to the back of a smartphone and demonstrate clinical-grade accuracy for the measurement of blood pressure.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve the productivity and environmental sustainability of soybean cultivation. Soybean is the most widely grown crop in the United States with nearly 90 million acres under cultivation. Soybean is a key part of the food system and generates $22 billion in export revenue each year. One of the greatest threats to soybean production is the fungal pathogen known as Asian Soybean Rust. Current commercial soybean varieties have no resistance to this pathogen and over $2 billion is spent annually on fungicides to control this disease. While soybean is highly susceptible to this disease, many wild plant species have natural resistance to this pathogen. This project seeks to identify the naturally occurring mechanisms of disease resistance in wild plant species that can be used to develop disease-resistant soybean varieties. Adoption of these varieties is expected to bring more than $4 billion in value to the soybean industry while improving productivity and reducing fungicide use.

    The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase I project is to identify plant immune receptor proteins that confer disease resistance to Asian Soybean Rust, which is caused by the fungal pathogen Phakopsora pachyrhizi. A key determinant of whether or not a plant is resistant to a particular pathogen is whether the plant has an appropriate immune receptor protein capable of recognizing the presence of the invading pathogen. Once activated, plant immune receptors trigger plant defense responses that typically result in immunity. This project will use reverse genetic and biochemical approaches to identify plant immune receptor proteins that confer resistance to Asian Soybean Rust. Preliminary work identified several molecules from Phakopsora that elicit an immune response in non-host plant species. The goal is to identify the cognate immune receptors and test them for sufficiency to enable immune activation in response to Asian Soybean Rust elicitor molecules. This research will enable future work to the development soybean varieties with resistance to Asian Soybean Rust.

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable researchers to recruit participants
    for clinical trials more quickly and reliably. A major problem in medical research
    is that a majority of clinical trials are delayed or canceled because of insufficient
    recruitment of eligible participants. By developing an independent (third-party)
    data aggregation platform for detailed electronic patient data through this project,
    researchers will be able to efficiently reach a large pool of potential participants
    for trials, and increase the likelihood of trial success. The resulting platform
    will create a much more efficient recruitment system, as the data is shared among
    the broader research community rather than managed by any individual research
    organization. With subscriptions and fees per enrolled patient, the platform will
    be able sustain itself while at the same time lowering recruitment costs for researchers.
    More broadly, the greater ability to design and execute successful clinical trials
    will be a huge benefit to the medical community and accelerate the pace of research
    and new product development. \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
    Phase I project seeks to improve the speed, accuracy, and reliability of clinical
    trial design and recruitment. Research organizations like pharmaceutical companies
    and hospitals typically maintain isolated databases with limited, static patient
    data. This project focuses on building a third-party data platform that elegantly
    stores and organizes electronic patient data. The design of the platform enables
    ontological queries, allowing researchers to consult data when designing trials
    and quickly ?testing? specific inclusion/exclusion criteria to determine feasibility.
    When proceeding to execute the trial, the platform will rank individuals by likelihood
    to enroll, and facilitate contact with potential patients that have previously
    provide consent to be contacted. Initial objectives of the project include the
    development of a methodology to abstract patient data from medical records, and
    programming of the database structure. Later the work will focus on quality assurance
    software, and algorithms to translate free-text trial requirements into filters
    compatible with said database. The expected outcome is a platform storing accurate
    data of 200 patients, with filtering and ranking algorithms that match patients
    to trials with nearly the same accuracy of an experienced recruitment team.\n\nThis

    therapies available for the almost 4 million patients in the U.S. who suffer from
    diastolic heart failure (DHF) - a disease for which the potential market is estimated
    to be approximately $5B worldwide. In DHF, the chambers of the heart become stiff
    and cannot relax completely, reducing the amount with which they fill with blood
    and thus reducing the amount of blood pumped by the heart during each cardiac
    cycle. The only evidence-based therapy to treat DHF is to manage blood pressure
    pharmacologically, and treat associated complications. DHF is a major cause of
    hospital admissions and has poor patient outcomes, without any discernable improvement
    over the last two decades. Thus, there is a strong need for an effective device
    solution that can alleviate the symptoms associated with DHF while improving patient
    outcomes, as well as further fundamental understanding of the key factors and
    mechanisms that lead to DHF. \n\nThis project is focused on the development of
    a non-blood contacting biventricular diastolic recoil device for the treatment
    of patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), also
    referred to as diastolic heart failure (DHF). The proposed device will provide
    a patented minimally invasive, non-blood contacting approach to mitigate the symptoms
    associated with HFpEF, addressing a large unmet need in a market which currently
    lacks any approved device therapies. Primary goals of this Phase I project include
    investigating variations in device design, functionality, and mechanical properties
    in pilot animal studies in order to optimize augmentation of cardiac function
    and hemodynamics, as well as the development of an accelerated fatigue test apparatus
    to test the durability of the device components. The commercialization effort
    in bringing this novel device to market will address the largely unmet need for
    the millions of Americans who suffer from DHF by alleviating symptoms, significantly

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the reinvention of community wellness programming from a typically qualitative process into an evidence-based procedure. Treating wellness as a science will allow for more efficacious use of wellness budgets (an annual expenditure exceeding $100 Billion), will create a positive social impact within organizations, and by extension, society as a whole. Organizations with effective wellness initiatives have higher employee engagement, improved productivity, and increased profitability. Hence, there is significant opportunity for societal and commercial impact through evidence-based wellness technologies.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project involves the theoretical development, and practical deployment, of recommendation algorithms that arrange meetings between groups of people with divergent interests and incentives. Our research objectives are (1) the development of a theoretically grounded recommendation algorithm that accounts for the effects of social dynamics and incentives on behavior, (2) the development of an application to facilitate community wellness through in-person meetings.  We anticipate the successful deployment of the platform, the collection of multi-center data for semi-supervised training and prospective evaluation of the developed algorithms.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be a novel wearable device for unobtrusively detecting changes in the lung health of patients with chronic respiratory disease. This Passive Unobtrusive Lung function Monitor (PULMO) will be the only device that can automatically measure a patient's lung health information without requiring any active engagement from the clinician, and without imposing any obtrusive changes to the patient's daily routine. The PULMO is useful in a broad range of respiratory disease applications, such as lung transplant post-operative care, asthma management and respiratory therapy research, that require continuous, objective and unobtrusive monitoring of lung function change. Since PULMO technology is compatible with low-cost microcontrollers, it has the potential to dominate the spirometry market and respiratory clinical trials space with high-volume production. The spirometry market has an expected CAGR of 9.4 % from 2018 to 2025, reaching a $1.4 billion market value by 2025, while clinical trials expenditures on new respiratory therapy drugs is forecast to reach $1.7 billion in 2025.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the major drawback of the state-of-the-art in continuous monitoring of respiratory disease, which is that it demands daily discipline, effort and proper technique of the patient, resulting in missing, invalid or fabricated data. In this project, a manufactured PULMO test device will be implemented with an intelligent event detection unit combined with a low power microcontroller, and the total average power consumption will be less than 300 microWatts. The measurement error of the PULMO will be within +/- 5 %, which is necessary for detecting changes in lung impairment. The intelligent event detection unit will be implemented as a nonlinear dynamical system in a custom integrated circuit. A gated recurrent neural network that is optimized for embedded low resource systems will be implemented in the low power microcontroller and will be used to detect respiratory disease symptoms. Controlled tests will be performed with a silicone phantom chest to evaluate the measurement accuracy of the PULMO device.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
    project is to make unique properties of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) widely available to
    developers. In doing so, the company will empower developers to create novel distributed services with
    trustworthy and consistent shared state operations that will lead to more transparent business
    and governance practices. In the Phase I tools will lead to new innovative meat
    distribution businesses in Bozeman, MT. In the long term, we aim to build the fundamental tools
    for the growing ranks of blockchain developers, who need powerful and easy-to-integrate tools
    that access and manipulate DLT state. Ultimately, our suite of services will provide a unified
    interface to multiple DLT implementations and facilitate the trustworthy exchange of shared
    state among different applications to create a wide and consistent view of world state.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to create an ecosystem of tools to operate on shared
    application state stored on DLTs and to roll out these tools as they mature. The ultimate goal is
    to provide a unified API much like that of leading cloud service providers, which consists of
    several incrementally introduced services.
    Specifically, the services planned to provide are:
    1. Blocky Valve - A JavaScript API that simplifies DLT read and write access.
    2. Blocky Pipes - A DLT data delivery microservice based on message queues connected
    to Blocky Valve.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to develop the first low-cost and integrated onboard charger and auxiliary power module for electric vehicles, facilitating deployment of next-generation electrified transportation systems. It is noteworthy that there are more than 250 million registered passenger vehicles in the U.S. Over 40% of greenhouse gases and 70% of emissions come from the transportation sector, and transportation is 99% dependent on one source of fuel: petroleum. Mainstream adoption of electric vehicles is essential if the U.S. is to gain energy security and substantially reduce carbon emissions. The electric car industry has passed its tipping point; however, electric vehicles are still in the very early stages of development. Like early computers, the pieces that make up an electric car are large, heavy, costly and unable to efficiently communicate amongst themselves. The proposed technology not only reduces the volume, cost, and weight of onboard chargers for electric vehicles, but also enhances their efficiencies, and enables bidirectional operation to support future Smart Grid functionalities. This project will lead to creating jobs once the technology matures toward commercialization.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will lead to design and development of an innovative integrated and bidirectional onboard charger for electric vehicles. Currently, all the upcoming and commercially available electric vehicles are equipped with an individual onboard charger to charge traction batteries and an additional auxiliary power module to power auxiliary loads. These converters are heavy, bulky, costly and need to communicate over a variety of controller area networks. The intellectual merit of this project is in the innovative topology, design, control, development, packaging, and validation of the first charger which integrates an onboard charger and an auxiliary power module. This SBIR Phase I project involves the design of the converter, investigation and design of the controller, design and implementation of the electromagnetic interference filter stage, creating the schematics and layout, thermal management, reliability analyses, enclosure design, and final alpha prototype assembly and verification. This important work will (1) lead to theoretical advancements in the design, control, and integration of power electronic converters, (2) involve interdisciplinary research in power electronics, control, packaging, and thermal management, and (3) lead to commercialization of the first integrated onboard charger and auxiliary power module for electric vehicles.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to create a cost-effective, high-performance anticorrosive coating for protecting metal structures, particularly in marine environments. High value assets that are essential parts of the US energy infrastructure, such as offshore oil and gas platforms, marine ships and wind turbines, are exposed to one of the most corrosive environments with direct exposure to salt water via immersion and seawater spray. Corrosion of these metal structures is estimated to cost the world economy around $2.3 trillion in maintenance and replacement capital every year. This project's superhydrophobic coating has the potential to significantly reduce both cost and waste by improving structural safety, reducing maintenance frequency and lengthening the operating lifetime of such vital assets. It will also reduce the environmental impact of corrosion protection systems by using less harmful materials, negating coating repainting needs and extending metal lifetime.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to make a durable, superhydrophobic, high-performance anticorrosive coating through creation of dual-function coating additives. Coatings and corrosion inhibitors are generally the first line of defense in this fight against corrosion. Highly-water repellent superhydrophobic coatings are leading contenders for delivering a step change in corrosion protection performance. However, current solutions suffer from two notable issues: high cost and low durability in highly corrosive marine environments. Existing superhydrophobic coatings require complex and expensive equipment and materials. In addition, these coatings are easily damaged during use, resulting in the loss of their water repellency and corrosion protection ability. The key innovation of this project is a novel dual-function additive that can impart coatings with both superhydrophobicity (passive corrosion protection) and on-demand corrosion inhibitors release (active corrosion protection). This additive based approach results in a durable coating that retains its protective abilities even through significant use and abrasion and enables adaptation to many other coating applications, even ones outside of corrosion.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is that enabling processing thin glass substrates for next generation communications and packaging needs will mean faster communications with improved power efficiency.  Society has an ever-expanding need for data, due to technologies such as mobile communications, cloud computing, the Internet of Things (IoT), and the shift of communication to higher frequencies (1s-10s of GHz).  As the frequency increases, traditional material choices, such as silicon, can experience very high losses and therefore there is increasing interest in using insulating materials, such as glass, to improve power efficiency.  Similarly, as device size is also important, ability to process thin materials is also critical.  Successful completion of this work will enable cost-effective processing of thin glass substrates and enable next generation communication initiatives impacting commercial, military and industrial markets.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is proposed to enable processing thin glass substrates in high volume environments.  There has been substantial interest in using glass for next generation RF and packaging solutions for many years due to its advantageous material properties, and scalability.  Of particular interest is the dielectric properties, which provide low electrical loss solutions relative to incumbent materials such as silicon.  Furthermore, the smoothness, hermetic properties and scalability of glass provides additional advantages over materials such as ceramics and organic laminates.  There has been a lot of progress in establishing processes to form thin glass and make precision through glass vias (TGV), as well as demonstrating advantaged functional performance in a lab environment.  There has been a challenge to establish the ability to scale to high volume for thin glass solutions due to gaps in the supply chain.  This SBIR project will establish a process that enables a carrier solution using a silicon carrier that will allow processing of glass in existing infrastructure making thin glass solutions available to the current well established and capable supply chain.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to improve security of cloud computing without sacrificing performance and cost efficiency. Cloud computing has proven to be a disruptive technology in the Information Technology (IT) sector, and the application container market is a rapidly growing segment of this sector. Although containers provide a simpler and more efficient apparatus to host applications in the cloud, there are important problems to address, such as weak security isolation, low kernel compatibility, and poor kernel customization. Security is the most common concern because one infected kernel can affect a multitude of containers. So far, each organization that has adopted container applications has been required to independently ensure their own security. One study found that a majority (54% of participants) ran containers on top of virtual machines (VMs) for security isolation, which sacrifices performance and cost efficiency. Thus, there is a significant need to provide a container architecture that supports greater security without sacrificing performance and cost efficiency. This project addresses this urgent need, and the resulting technology can be applied broadly to domains such as cloud computing, Information Technology (IT) infrastructures, Network Function Virtualization (NFV), etc.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will further improve usability, security, and efficiency of a novel software application container architecture, so that it can be easily deployed and evaluated by customers. While the current platform can run Docker containers without modifications, it is incompatible with the Docker and Kubernetes orchestration platforms, which is a probable obstacle to adoption for many container users and developers. The novel containers can run unmodified iterations of existing applications and automatically optimize performance of many applications by patching the binary during runtime. However, it is challenging to handle complicated scenarios in the application binary, and a more sophisticated technique is required to further improve the coverage of the automatic binary optimization module. Due to the licensing requirements of some of the software the novel container platform is based on, the research prototype is run open-source. The goal of this project is to address these limitations and challenges through five major objectives: support Docker and Kubernetes ecosystem compatibility; improve automatic binary optimization coverage; re-design the platform to avoid open-source license violations; further improve security; develop an automatic installation tool and a product demonstration.

    broad market adoption of rooftop and other methods for local wind energy generation
    through reduction in costs. This is achieved through development of technology
    designed to lower the cost of wind turbine drive trains and associated power electronics,
    high cost items which are often left without innovation in new wind turbine designs.
    Prohibitively high costs are currently the biggest barrier to widespread adoption
    of distributed wind turbines, and power electronics can be as much as 50% of these
    costs. Significant cost reduction has the potential to increase worldwide distributed
    wind power adoption. The innovative power train technology developed in this project
    is specifically designed to couple with a proprietary technology for wind capture
    at rooftop edges. When combined with this technology, costs estimates are competitive
    with rooftop solar energy, enabling wind energy to become a common addition to
    rooftop solar installations. Successful deployment of this technology will contribute
    to society by decreasing the carbon footprint of energy production, increasing
    energy resiliency, and creating new jobs associated with manufacturing and deployment.
    Significant manufacturing efforts are likely to remain in the US, creating local
    job opportunities and economic growth. \n\n\nThis Small Business Technology Transfer
    (STTR) Phase I project proposes to use a novel drive train architecture to reduce
    small wind turbine power train costs. In this architecture, costs are lowered
    by temporarily storing the energy coming out of the wind turbine rotor in a flywheel
    before passing it on to the generator. This allows for the power train to include
    a generator and inverter that are sized for average rather than peak power outputs,
    enables removal of diversion load, and allows for the use of a faster spinning,
    and therefore lower cost generator. The Phase I project seeks to prove the feasibility
    of developing a low-cost flywheel which meets the needs of the overall drive train
    (including efficiency and reliability), a powertrain control system which maintains
    high efficiency, and a powertrain system configuration which maintains the reduced
    cost projections required for market traction. Research efforts include development
    of a bench-scale drive train to test the controls of the flywheel, powertrain
    simulation to test alternative generator and converter topologies, and benchmarking
    of generator candidates to determine efficiency and power density.\n\nThis award

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will benefit manufacturers of residual gas analyzers, mass spectrometers, ion-mobility spectrometers, time-of-flight spectrometers and related instruments. Implementation of these sensors will increase the revenue, revenue streams and market share of commercial manufacturers of mass spectrometers by significantly lowering production cost, and by enabling penetration into new markets that require increased sensitivity, lowered size, weight, power consumption, and instrument complexity. The product, if successful, will lead to analytical tools that can substantially benefit the needs of education/research, space, bio/health, agricultural, defense and security markets.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop nanotechnology-based chip-scale ion sensors with ultra-high intrinsic charge-to-current amplification factors. This patent-pending technology allows semiconductor-processable miniaturization and scalability, sub-microwatt intrinsic power draw, and robust ambient-pressure-agnostic operation. With reduced size, weight, and power requirements, increased sensitivity and dynamic range, these sensors can potentially replace expensive, bulky, and/or high-power-consuming charged particle detectors such as microchannel plates, Daly detectors, electron-multiplier tubes and Faraday cups. The ability to operate under any ambient pressure and distinguish charge polarity can significantly enhance field-portability, turnkey operations, and enhance analytical reach of ion-sensing-based applications. Specifically, the proposed research will seek to overcome the challenges related to generation of high signal responses (by enhancing the electronic transport parameters), high ion-sensor interaction (by optimizing sensor design), and lower readout noise (by optimizing materials and design).

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is in contributing towards the global effort in minimizing food spoilage and combating world hunger. The worldwide cold-chain freight and logistics industry deals with the storage and transportation of more than 100 million metric tons of fresh produce annually. In this industry, there is currently an urgent need to continuously monitor the air quality in shipping containers where large volumes of perishable food items (fresh fruits and vegetables) are stored. Poor environmental conditions in these containers such as unregulated or high temperatures and low humidity can trigger early ripening of fruits and vegetables, leading to the efflux of specific volatile organic compounds; predominantly ethylene. Due to large volume of produce stored in these containers, if gone unchecked, the environment inside can quickly accumulate high levels of ethylene leading to accelerated ageing and subsequently spoilage. As one can imagine, an appropriate gas sensing technology to continuously monitor ethylene levels would allow adaptive climate control inside the containers, thereby ensuring produce freshness on arrival and preventing billions of dollars in loss and reducing food waste.

    This SBIR phase I project proposes to develop a low-cost ethylene sensing technology using bulk silicon transistor technology (also called CS-FET or chemical sensitive field effect transistor), for mass-deployment in refrigerated containers transporting fresh produce to different parts of the world. This innovation will address an unmet need in the cold-chain logistics industry where continuous monitoring of fruits and vegetables is required to ensure quality and freshness on-arrival. Existing technologies are either too expensive or have poor sensitivity for deployment in large-scale sensing operations. Specifically, Phase I seeks to identify and engineer a sensitive nanoscale catalyst/sensing-layer that will respond to ethylene. To develop the ethylene sensing layers, this effort will pursue the screening of various nanomaterial systems such as ultra-thin layers of noble and transition metals, their composites, sub-oxides, as well as polymeric films using the silicon CS-FET as the backbone technology platform. Additionally, the proposal will also seek to develop a scientific understanding of the interaction mechanism between ethylene and the target sensing layer at both standard ambient conditions as well as conditions prevalent in reefer containers, i.e. low temperature and high humidity.

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve high-risk pregnancy care and preterm
    labor detection by developing a noninvasive, low-cost, point-of-care wearable
    electronic patch for pregnancy monitoring in both clinical and home environments.
    Each year, 4 million women give birth in the US. More than one in ten of pregnancies
    is considered high-risk, where the mother, fetus, or newborn has elevated risk
    of experiencing an adverse health condition. The proposed platform will allow
    doctors to remotely monitor and manage high-risk pregnancies and intervene, as
    needed, upon detection of labor or other potential complications. By enhancing
    early detection of fetal well-being and increasing access to care, the device
    will allow for improved healthcare delivery, thus increasing mother and infant
    safety, preventing maternal and neonatal morbidities, and lowering healthcare
    costs. By applying machine learning to what could become the largest and most
    comprehensive dataset on maternal and fetal health, the proposed platform could
    become a valuable resource to researchers to identify underlying causes and biomarkers
    of preterm birth. Primary end users are women with high-risk pregnancies, and
    elevated risk of preterm birth. Target customers are hospitals, health care providers
    and insurance companies. \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase
    I project seeks to develop an unprecedented means to support advances in maternal
    and fetal health: a state-of-the-art miniaturized mobile monitor that discretely
    sticks onto the mother's abdomen and uses sensors to noninvasively monitor fetal
    heart rate (FHR) and other physiological parameters in home and clinical environments.
    The device communicates to a smartphone, which acts as gateway to send data to
    a cloud-based platform, where the data is collected, stored and analyzed, with
    doctors able to set notification thresholds. For this project, patch technology,
    proven to effectively measure uterine activity and fetal movement will be leveraged
    to develop a disruptive product capable of detecting FHR as early as 25 weeks
    gestation. Miniaturization, power consumption and cost levels necessary for deployment
    in remote settings will be achieved. A usability study of the prototype monitor
    will then be conducted in expectant women in hospital settings, followed by an
    equivalency study to validate accuracy of the prototype compared to cardiotocogram,
    the current clinical gold standard. This solution will increase specificity of
    FHR testing, and improve interpretation of monitoring data, as well as aggregate
    data to train AI models to predict adverse events such as preterm birth.\n\nThis

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop technology for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq).  Single-cell RNA-sequencing has emerged as one of the best tools to catalogue cell types and understand their function.  The key advantage of scRNA-seq is that it provides transcriptome-wide information about individual cells in heterogeneous samples while alternative methods either provide information about only a limited set of genes (e.g., flow cytometry, qPCR) or cannot provide single-cell resolution (bulk RNA-seq, microarrays).  However, current scRNA-seq approaches remain expensive, enable only limited sample multiplexing, and are not compatible with common sample storage conditions. This project will focus on the key technical challenges that are required to develop universally applicable scRNA-seq kits that meet customer needs. If successful, the end product will be a scRNA-seq kit that is ready for pilot testing with academic and pharmaceutical company customers. By reducing the cost and increasing sample size and sample multiplexing of scRNA-seq, the technology will improve the ability to understand multicellular systems and enhance workflows used in the pharmaceutical industry, such as drug screening and patient stratification.

    The intellectual merit of this SBIR  Phase I project is to develop a single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) method by using a combinatorial barcoding scheme that labels transcripts within fixed cells.  The proposed technology makes it possible to measure the transcriptional profiles of hundreds of thousands of individual cells in parallel. Unlike previous scRNA-seq technologies, the technology also enables high sample multiplexing (up to 96 samples/experiment), is compatible with stored samples, and fixes cells before dissociation, reducing the risk of perturbations to gene expression during cell handling. Most importantly, the method requires no complex instruments, which contributes to making the technology an order of magnitude less expensive than existing technologies. The objectives of this project are to dramatically improve the number of molecules detected per cell and to simplify the workflow for users. Modifications to assay chemistry will be tested to increase molecular detection, and time-consuming steps in the workflow will be altered to shorten the overall experimental time and reduce the probability of user error.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to create an abuse-free and ad-free social network based on principles of affirmative consent using a novel hybrid human-machine moderation technology. Harassment and abuse plague current social platforms. This abuse is particularly directed towards women, people of color, and the LGBTQ community, who are most vulnerable to these types of attacks. These demographics around the world need a harassment-free social network platform to communicate and share content and would be willing to pay a subscription fee. In addition, independent "new media" content creators also need an advertising-free and harassment-free platform to build an audience, interact with followers or fans, control access to paid content, and receive payment for their work. Users who have fled other platforms due to harassment, data mining, or personal privacy concerns may also want friendly and safe spaces to interact and share content. In addition to subscription fees, this novel moderation technology has the potential to be offered as a service to other social network businesses.

    This Small Business Innovation Research SBIR Phase I project takes a novel consent-based approach to social network moderation. The project combines data from multiple sources, including machine learning models, in order to give users more control over the content they wish to see and prevent harassment and abuse. By supplementing automated approaches with human ones, and putting users in control of which sources of moderation content and metadata to trust, this innovation will reduce the labor required for human moderation and the accuracy of machine approaches, all while making relatively strong guarantees that the most vulnerable users will not be exposed to abuse or harassment.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop technology using engineered bacteria
    to improve protein stability in two large markets: therapeutic proteins and industrial
    enzymes. Proteins used as therapeutics frequently have insufficient half-lives
    in human blood plasma, so that patients with chronic disease need to receive frequent
    dosings, often by painful injections. These burdensome dosing schedules result
    in high rates of patient noncompliance, with attendant poor responses and negative
    health outcomes. Therapeutic proteins with improved half-lives in blood plasma
    would permit relaxed dosing schedules, lowering costs of administration and improving
    outcomes by reducing noncompliance. This proposed technology focuses on improving
    the plasma half-life of a therapeutic for a chronic disease primarily affecting
    children that currently comprises a $4B global market. Similarly, industrial enzymes
    are frequently deployed in harsh environments that impair enzyme stability and
    activity. Endowing enzymes with improved resistance to destabilizing chemicals
    would enable their deployment in high-value environments that are currently prohibitive.
    The proposed technology will be used to stabilize an enzyme for application in
    a $730M segment of the personalized medicine market. If successful, this work
    would provide a platform for developing next-generation enzymes deployable in
    currently prohibitive environments. \n\nThe intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase
    I project is to utilize a synthetic biology platform to create proteins with new
    amino acid building blocks that dramatically improve half-life and stability.
    Many proteins used as therapeutics or used as industrial enzymes are stabilized
    by disulfide bonds. These bonds break in the presence of chemicals called reducing
    agents that are found both in human blood plasma (destabilizing to therapeutics)
    and in solvents and buffers (destabilizing to industrial enzymes). Using a strain
    of engineered E. coli that can incorporate amino acids beyond the 20 standard
    amino acids into proteins, the goal is to replace disulfide-forming cysteine amino
    acids with selenocysteine amino acids that form bonds called diselenides. Diselenide-stabilized
    proteins maintain stability and activity in environments with reducing agents
    incompatible with disulfide-stabilized proteins. This project will produce a diselenide-stabilized
    protein therapeutic for a major disease class. Improvements to disulfide-stabilized
    therapeutics will be demonstrated by ELISA assays showing improved binding activity,
    and by cell-based assays showing improved therapeutic activity, after prolonged
    exposure to blood plasma. This project also will produce a diselenide-stabilized
    industrial enzyme to catalyze a critical reaction for personalized medicine. Performance
    improvements over disulfide-stabilized enzymes will be demonstrated by in vitro
    stability and activity assays in reducing conditions.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's
    statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
    the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to bring curative gene editing therapies using CRISPR to patients with genetic diseases. CRISPR-based therapeutics have the potential to be next generation therapeutics, particularly for genetic diseases due to their ability to cut DNA with sequence specificity. However, this type of targeted genome editing has not yet been successfully demonstrated for human therapeutics with existing methods.  The translation of CRISPR-based gene editing to the clinic remains a significant unmet need and the most difficult aspect of translating CRISPR-based gene editing into therapeutics is the lack of safe and effective delivery methods to the target the tissues. Existing viral-based delivery systems have limitations that include immunogenicity, pre-existing antibodies against them, broad tropism, off-target effects, restricted DNA cargo packaging capacity, and manufacturing challenges. As a result, non-viral methods that employ synthetic materials are being widely investigated as potential alternatives. Developing non-viral delivery vehicles that can effectively deliver CRISPR components to target tissues will improve the ability to broadly use CRISPR-based therapeutics for many genetic diseases.

    The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase I project is to develop a non-viral delivery system for the CRISPR enzyme Cas 12a (Cpf1) for delivery to target muscle tissue, and, potentially, enable the development of a novel gene editing treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). The approach involves proprietary CRISPR-nanoparticles that are composed of peptide PEG-PAsp(DET) complexed to Cpf1 RNP, which possess good biocompatibility and high gene editing efficiency with the potential to manufacture and scale up under GMP for use in clinical trials. Preliminary data demonstrate that PEG-PAsp(DET) complexed to Cpf1 RNP can efficiently deliver Cpf1 RNP to the muscle tissue and can induce the expression of the dystrophin protein by deleting exon23 with a mutation. Under this proposal, the specific experiments will focus on improving the biocompatibility, stability, and muscle-targeting ability of the CRISPR-nanoparticles. The experimental plan is to synthesize various Peptide-PEG-PAsp(DET), followed by screening in primary myoblasts and reporter mouse system. This technology using CRISPR-nanoparticles will be the first example of a delivery vehicle that can simultaneously deliver Cpf1 protein and gRNA via intravenous injection and achieve gene editing.

    This SBIR Phase I project is dedicated to building a scalable project-based learning education technology platform. The technology in this project is based on a chatbot that sustains ongoing, interdisciplinary conversations with each student. The platform is designed to provide middle school students with curriculum materials that expose them to authentic and engaging real-world problems that, over the course of weeks or months, come together to form a cohesive response to a project prompt. The goal of this project is to build and refine this new form of eLearning platform that has the potential to greatly improve engagement and learning outcomes, especially for low-income and minority students. This goal will be achieved by making the standards-aligned educational content meaningful and relevant to the interests of students and by catering the instructional materials to each individual student's skill level so they can move through the materials at their own pace towards mastery. To measure the impact of this technology on student outcomes, this project will involve state-of-the-art efficacy research in accordance with guidelines in the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA).


    This SBIR Phase I project is concerned with developing a forward-looking education platform built around a chatbot that sustains long term, goals-oriented conversations powered by artificial intelligence (AI) and based on a decision tree architecture. The highly-customized chatbot is designed to make project-based learning scalable by empowering students to choose and customize their own project theme from a set of options, and then providing conversational explanations and practice questions that illustrate how Common Core standards apply to the student?s project. This research undertaking will involve developing and training custom neural networks to interpret student responses and questions. It will also involve developing algorithms that correctly identify each student's level of reading comprehension and, independently, conceptual understanding. With an understanding of the student's level, another algorithm will be developed that selects the appropriate materials and resources at the student?s reading comprehension level. These algorithms will be refined through user testing and a preliminary study of the efficacy of this education intervention will be tested in a correlational study with statistical controls.

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase I project will test the feasibility of incorporating
    a novel vaccine technology to diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis (DTaP)
    vaccine to produce a thermostable and orally administered formulation. Vaccines
    are one of the best investments in global public health and are estimated to save
    2-3 million lives per year and protect more than 100 million lives from illness
    and disability. This project proposes to use a novel vaccine technology platform
    that targets immune cells in the intestine, enducing a broad immune response,
    and retains stability at room temperature. This technology has the potential to
    minimize dependence on the cold-chain and trained medical professionals to administer
    the vaccine, which are barriers to full vaccine coverage. Additionally, it has
    potential to increase uptake of vaccine booster doses for adults, with convenience
    of self-administration and reduced anxiety with no needles. Finally, successful
    formulation of an oral DTaP vaccine would open the doors to other antigens to
    be delivered orally. This technology can significantly improve national health,
    which is one of the missions of NSF. Additionally, switching vaccines to thermostable,
    oral delivery form is very cost-effective and will alleviate the burden and cost
    of cold-chain and professional to administer the vaccines. \n\nThis SBIR Phase
    I project will test the application of a novel delivery technology to the DTaP
    vaccine. The highly innovative delivery platform consists of a novel adjuvant,
    a C-type lectin (CTL) receptor ligand with aluminum hydroxide that targets mucosal
    immune cells for a strong synergistic boosting of broad immune response, and microencapsulation
    of the vaccine to resist the strong acidic environment of the stomach. This technology
    can be incorporated into existing or new vaccines enhancing stability and allowing
    oral delivery. The first goal of this project includes incorporation of CTL receptor
    ligand to the DTaP vaccine and applying enteric microencapsulation to the particles
    to protect the vaccine from low pH. Extensive testing and experiments will be
    conducted to obtain the optimal formulation of the final oral vaccine. The second
    goal will be to test and compare the potency of the newly formulated vaccine with
    a commercially available DTaP vaccine in mice. The final goal will be to test
    and compare the stability of both vaccines at high temperatures. Successful completion
    of all objectives will provide a great base for commercial feasibility of the
    technology. This technology has the potential to be incorporated on any vaccine
    that can benefit from a thermostable and orally delivery platform.\n\nThis award
    reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
    evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of a single beam ion source that enables the manufacturing of high-quality thin film materials and related products. Thin films have a significant impact on quality of life as they are used widely in semiconductor devices, displays, solar panels, tribological coatings, cell phones, optical filters, and micro-electro-mechanical systems. The annual market of these industry segments exceeds $600 billion and has been steadily increasing. Common methods to produce thin films include physical and chemical vapor depositions, which today have tradeoffs between film quality and manufacturability. A high deposition rate results in loosely packed atoms and subsequently unstable materials properties. Producing high-quality dense films today requires slow deposition at elevated temperatures leading to high manufacturing cost and other limitations, such as inability to use flexible substrates. Ion sources are plasma generation devices that enable ion beams to interact with materials at the atomic level and efficiently produce dense films. The single beam ion sources bring in multiple benefits for thin film fabrication, including superior stability, improved adhesion, low electrical resistivity, high optical transmittance, and smooth surfaces.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will validate the technical and commercial feasibilities of the single beam ion sources particularly suitable for fabricating high-quality thin films and devices. In ion beam assisted thin-film deposition, ions simultaneously interact with the atoms as they are deposited from another source. The ions transfer kinetic energies to the surface atoms so that they can move around to form densely packed films. The single beam ion sources proposed in this project can produce a highly focused beam of ions with tunable energy for optimal processing of the growing films. These unique features are enabled by an innovative design of the electromagnetic fields, which efficiently generate plasmas and extract the ions in a narrow beam. Unlike the conventional racetrack type ion sources, the single beam ion sources can accurately control the ion incident angle, which has strong effects on the surface morphology of the deposited film.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is that it addresses the injection molding industry which generates over $100 billion in revenue in the US alone. The proposed multivariate shrinkage sensor promises a leap forward from the current use of in-mold pressure/temperature sensors for indirect estimation of molded part dimensions and quality. Direct measurement of the shrinkage along with pressure and temperature in situ from the proposed sensor will enable improved process and quality control methods for injection molding which will eliminate the burden of frequent post-molding inspections and allow fully automated manufacturing. As a result, over 30 % of manufacturing cost and time will be saved while achieving 100% quality assurance even for the parts with tighter specifications. The proposed sensor will help heavily regulated industries such as medical devices and automobile manufacturing in achieving significant time reduction for process set-up and stabilization, and improvement in parts quality while meeting stringent regulatory requirements. Each percentage point improvement in productivity due to cycle time reductions, yield improvements, and related automation corresponds to cost savings of more than $1 billion per year in the United States alone while reducing the energy consumption and environmental waste related to molding, discarding, and recycling of defective plastic parts.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project provides a creative and original concept: a multivariate design for measuring shrinkage along with pressure and temperatures via a conventionally packaged device. Furthermore, knowledge and understanding are expected to be advanced in the development and validation of improved on-line models for estimating molded part shrinkage in real-time. Previous research did not have access to in-mold shrinkage data and so propagated faulty initial conditions throughout the shrinkage analysis. Due to the lack of direct observability and controllability of the molded part dimensions, most molders rely on the use of cavity pressure traces or part weight measurements as estimators of the part dimensions. However, there still is no technology or research available to monitor and predict the shrinkage on-line during production to improve, to optimize and to control parts quality and processing parameters without using expensive instrumentation. The outcome of this Phase I project will fill this gap and develop a fully functional multivariate shrinkage sensor which will enable measurement of molded product dimensions in situ prior to ejection from the mold.

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a novel seed treatment technology
    for plants, based on small naturally occurring molecules proven to activate natural
    defenses against a wide range of agriculturally important pathogens. The proposed
    innovation as a plant protectant is active at very low concentrations (nM range),
    can be readily synthesized in large quantities, and is biodegradable and non-toxic.
    To feed a projected world population of over 9 billion people in 2050, innovation
    will be required at all stages of crop production and distribution. Annual application
    of more than 600 different chemical pesticides (500 million Kg) costs $10 billion,
    and yet 37% of all crops are still destroyed by pests (insects 13%, pathogens
    12%, weeds 12%). By providing an alternative, effective method for managing transmissible
    diseases in major crops, dependence on existing agrochemicals such as copper,
    synthetic fungicides and antibiotics will be reduced, as will the rate of resistance
    development. The goal is to improve the economic and environmental sustainability
    of agriculture by reducing the use of potentially harmful pesticides, and significantly
    enhance food security worldwide. \n\nThe intellectual merit of this SBIR project
    is to develop a novel control for plant pathogens by leveraging a class of small,
    naturally occurring molecules that elicit specific immune responses in plants.
    These small molecules are recognized by plants at extremely low concentrations,
    and their perception has been demonstrated to result in defense responses and
    enhanced resistance to viral, bacterial, oomycete, and fungal pathogens, in Arabidopsis,
    tomato, potato, barley, and wheat. In order to bring the innovation to market
    in the form of a commercial seed treatment, the following must be demonstrated:
    a seed-coating formulation capable of long-term stability and efficacy, without
    adverse effect on seed germination or natural microbe/insect populations. The
    focus of the proposed Phase I project will be to optimize synthesis of the compound
    of interest and develop a stable, commercially viable formulation that is effective
    across a breadth of crops. Following initial validation, product testing will
    advance to in vivo efficacy testing in greenhouse and field trials. The seed treatment
    product developed will establish the technical and economic feasibility of using
    small-molecule signals to activate plant immune responses, and demonstrate their
    utility to improve economic and environmental sustainability of agriculture.\n\nThis

    This SBIR Phase I project examines the feasibility of using magnetic sensors based on Acoustically Driven Ferromagnetic Resonance (ADFMR) for neurological imaging. Information about brain activity is critical to the diagnosis and treatment of a variety of disorders including epilepsy, traumatic brain injury, and Alzheimer's disease. The most powerful non-invasive technique for measuring brain activity, magnetoencephalography (MEG), uses magnetometers that require liquid helium cooling and magnetic shielding to operate. Due to these requirements, current MEG systems are large and expensive, limiting their adoption and accessibility. ADFMR sensors could allow for the measurement of biomagnetic fields without the need for cryogenics and magnetic shielding, dramatically reducing the size, cost, and power consumption of such systems. The portability of this improved technology would allow for functional neuroimaging outside of the carefully controlled imaging suites where it is possible today. This could allow for diagnosis of previously unreachable patients (ie. in the ICU, operating room, or ambulance) as well as the development of new uses for this technology (ie. long-term monitoring, scanning during movement). This improved, portable MEG could also enable the first practical, portable brain-computer interface ? applicable across a wide variety of applications in both defense and consumer sectors.

    This SBIR Phase I project investigates the ability for ADFMR sensors to measure extremely small magnetic fields, such as those generated by the human brain. The ADFMR phenomenon has been shown to be a much more power and size efficient alternative to traditional methods of exciting ferromagnetic resonance, allowing for its use as a sensing mechanism for chip-scale magnetometers. In the proposed program, a number of methods to improve the performance of current ADFMR devices will be investigated. First, a compact model will be developed to allow for fast modeling of ADFMR devices and their associated detection circuitry. Using the results of this model, devices will be fabricated in order to experimentally validate various mechanisms for the reduction of 1/f noise in the detector circuitry and for the optimization of the ADFMR absorption profile for maximum sensitivity to applied magnetic fields. These sensor elements will initially be tested using standard benchtop characterization equipment. Following a benchtop demonstration, challenges in miniaturizing the full sensor system will be addressed by developing fully integrated magnetometer prototypes.

    This SBIR Phase I project will develop educational technologies to better train university students to innovate. To become innovators, students must gain practice solving real-world problems, such as reducing hospital acquired infections, narrowing education achievement gaps or reducing poverty. However, universities struggle to provide the labor intensive, face-to-face coaching necessary for student innovators to tackle real-world problems. This project develops a novel online project-based learning platform that helps instructors more effectively coach innovation project teams. The platform allows instructors to (a) create libraries of project goals to help students plan, (b) collaboratively author and remix design guides to help students develop technical skills, and (c) crowdsource large group, face-to-face critique to provide feedback on in-progress innovation work. The research and development in this project focus on overcoming the technical risks associated with creating the software libraries necessary to create new project-based learning platforms and supporting the complex computer-supported collaborative learning interactions necessary to achieve desired learning outcomes. By developing the technologies necessary to enable more effective project-based learning, this project will improve university education and create a more capable innovation workforce better able to tackle societal challenges.


    This SBIR Phase I project will conduct research and development of the Loft platform, which combines a novel project-based learning environment, social media platform, and software components to transform how universities train social innovators. Technical risks in this project stem from software engineering, learning sciences, and computer-supported cooperative work obstacles associated with creating novel software platforms to enable new pedagogical strategies that achieve more effective learning outcomes in project-based learning environments. Software libraries will include a more powerful and flexible set of components for creating complex object hierarchies and social media interfaces required for rapid development of the crowdsourcing and real-time collaborative editing features needed for online project-based learning platforms. The platform will introduce new computer-supported collaborative learning strategies, such as collaborative remixing of instructional content, technology-supported tailoring of instructional goals to individual project teams, and crowd critique to provide feedback as good or better than individual instructors. Research and development will test the impact of the platform on learning outcomes for innovation teams.

- abstractText: |-
    This SBIR Phase I project proposes the creation of a unique, art-centric e-learning platform aimed at sparking the interest of young learners in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). This extensible software platform implements a new category of e-learning based on the ample body of research in educational psychology and technology that advocates the use of art and guided play to teach STEM. This project will test the hypothesis that an e-learning system based on scientific illustration sparks engagement and enhances learning in young students. With students disengaging from STEM at an increasing rate, it is critical to make more tools available to teachers that connect student with STEM. STEM-related fields will drive innovation in our economy for decades to come; opening new pathways to vastly broaden participation in STEM is critical to our economic future. This project also proposes the creation of an online community and marketplace supporting STEM education through this platform. This will connect teacher-to-teacher for sharing best practices in teaching science using art and can make a deep and broad impact on the way STEM is taught.


    Built on scientific illustration and coupled with a set of tangible user interface (TUI) devices that mimic scientific instruments, this e-learning platform brings student hand-drawn art to life, creating interactive lessons that correlate to Next Generation Science Standards. As this system will be extensible and customizable, a major part of the R&D effort will be to create an easy-to-use templating toolkit that any teacher can leverage to develop custom lessons in STEM. The Phase I goal will be to create a fully functioning product and assess this system in elementary school classrooms. This toolkit will be developed in collaboration with Curio Interactive?s educational partners, as well as the Pacific Science Center, where Curio Interactive is a startup in residence, to rapidly develop this system, continuously iterating the software with real testers, following agile development methods. One of this project?s objectives is to appeal to groups historically underrepresented in STEM. Because this platform will be visual and kinetic, highly affordable, and universally available via the web, the proposed platform will improve the equity and accessibility of learning science.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will result from enabling businesses to process and extract insights from large unlabeled datasets, using machine learning with minimal human supervision, in application areas such as cyber security, precision medicine and predictive maintenance.  Current deep learning approaches require large amounts of labeled data.  Creation of labeled data is expensive, error prone and time consuming. The proposed software will provide fully automated capabilities for semi-supervised learning for anomaly detection in cyber security applications. All businesses ranging from large scale enterprises to boutique data science consulting firms will benefit from this project. The expected impact can range in the billions of dollars in the areas of cyber security and predictive maintenance, to name just two. More broadly the proposed technologies will enable both corporations and public institutions to harvest large datasets at minimal cost.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will design, develop, and deploy high-performance computing (HPC) software for unsupervised learning and anomaly detection. In the last decades tremendous successes in machine learning have been achieved in the area of supervised learning that requires compilation of large datasets with labels (for example, grouping of pictures based on the individual depicted on the image). In contrast, unsupervised learning algorithms do not require labels and thus require minimal human participation. However, due to significant technical difficulties they have not been as successful as supervised learning algorithms. This software package circumvents these difficulties and opens the way to scaling unsupervised learning algorithms to large and complex datasets.  The main research and development challenges that will be addressed in this project are the ability to integrate this new technology with real world complex datasets through the choice of the correct comparison function between the objects of the dataset and the fully automatic algorithm and algorithm parameter selection.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to disrupt the 1000 hours per child per year where American children have no school and no parents and deserve access to the best enrichment activities. The company plans to build a much-needed technical infrastructure for schools, enrichment providers, and parents. By automating and simplifying the process of providers supplying, parents consuming and schools hosting enrichment activities, the proposed system will remove significant friction and create an efficient market. A key invention is the company's Automatic Schedule Recommendation System which recommends a schedule of classes for a family of one or more children and satisfies constraints such as ages and driving distance, maximizes desirable attributes such as minimal driving and diversity in classes across time, and leverages historical data like classes taken in the past and social data such as classes enjoyed by friends and classmates, to make effective recommendations. The proposed technology removes the most significant friction during parents' purchases of enrichment classes, namely, piecing together a class schedule from classes across different providers. This project is the first interdisciplinary research that strategically combines algorithms from the fields of optimizations and recommender systems to solve the problem and achieve scalability and efficiency.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will design, implement and evaluate an Automatic Schedule Recommendation System. Existing recommender systems are insufficient because they largely recommend a single item to a single user; this application requires that a sequence of items (namely, a sequence of classes that fit in a coherent schedule) be recommended and coordinated among a group of users (i.e. children in the same family or set of friends). Existing class scheduling algorithms are insufficient because they find optimal schedules using known preferences; in this problem there is a need to predict preferences. The company will design a fully-automatic schedule recommendation system that predicts the suitability of each session to each user using machine learning techniques and aggregates these predictions over time to propose full schedules that are most appropriate for a parent and satisfy multi-dimensional constraints. The resulting system will be deployed to the company's users along with extensive evaluation of its efficacy.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to drive economic growth and innovation by increasing a knowledge worker's ease of access to the digital information that is relevant to his/her work. Businesses today are enormously dependent on the archives of files, communication, and other information contained within the systems and services they rely on (networked drives, cloud storage, messaging tools, email, etc.). As these archives grow, they are increasingly hard to standardize and organize so that individuals know where to look for and how to find the information they need to do their jobs. The result is that individual employees waste enormous amounts of time trying to locate files and information fragmented across complex directories and many communication channels. Centralizing access to files and communication within an easily searchable and flexible workspace can unlock several hours of lost productivity and duplicate efforts per knowledge worker per week. Furthermore, presenting all of the relevant context around each file and message, including other file-versions, related files, discussions, activity events, etc., can help knowledge workers today with better version control, an understanding of how projects/ideas unfold, transferring of best practices, and preventing institutional knowledge-loss.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to further develop a novel method for users to contextually and unobtrusively access all relevant files and information associated with their work. This project focuses on developing software that can automatically map the relationships between digital workflow components (email messages, chat messages, tasks, contacts, files, etc.), and store them in discrete private databases controlled by the users. This project's key technical challenges include: improving the proprietary algorithms that automatically interconnect user information (while the information remains hosted on third party systems/services); improving the scalability of data ingress, processing, indexing, and syncing; and establishing a system capable of hosting and processing a multitude of discrete and disconnected databases of user information. The anticipated outcome of this project is a new type of software platform that can be hosted in private instances and that improves the productivity of its users by: consolidating user information stored on third-party systems/services; making it all easily searchable and manageable; and augmenting every file with additional history and context from all other connected third party systems/services.

    This SBIR Phase I project will create a novel educational product by pairing VR/360 video with impact measurement software and interactive social engagement tools to simulate true-to-life experiences that enable users to gain personal insight into pressing social issues and then take action to solve them. Installed either as a multisensory 'empathy exhibition' or used in a classroom setting, participants embark on a transformative learning journey which builds empathy and critical understanding about a social issue and those affected by it, then connects them to concrete opportunities to make social change. Users begin as uniformed participants, and through the proposed process emerge as changemakers engaged in solving social problems. Experiential learning has long been an empathy building discipline outside the mediated experience, yet it is encumbered by barriers of cost, safety, distance, time and access that limit participation. Transformation360 will use technology to render experiential learning programs virtually anywhere. The result will be a revolutionary new way to move the public from apathy to action on a limitless number of social issues. Transformation360 will provide nonprofits, governments, and institutions working to solve social problems with a powerful social engagement tool that creates actively engaged citizens, consumers, volunteers, supporters, and social entrepreneurs to address the world's most pressing social problems.


    This SBIR Phase I project will develop a VR/360 video hybridization that will allow users interactive choices within a conventional three-degree-of-freedom 360 Video experience. Currently only VR's computer-generated imaging can provide a significant choice landscape for users. By using 360/3D photography, unique game engine software and multi-scenario video capture in the field the project will give users a new level of choice options for a photo documentary experiences. The efficacy of this technology for building empathy will be quantified through audience testing. Also, cinematic techniques such as mise-en-cine and montage, not currently used in most 360 video projects, will also be tested against audience reactions. These video production and consumption technologies and techniques will also be cross-tested against experience learning processes such as the breaking down assumptions, peer learning, debriefing, uncertainty, and risk. Potential adverse side effects to VR/360 video will also be addressed. The project will rely heavily on the engagement measurement and data visualization tool Harvis to test and analyze audience reactions to these experiments.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to enable smaller businesses to participate to the chatbot revolution, by making it easier to design and deploy chatbots. The initial focus of this project is healthcare, where there is great opportunity to improve the quality and availability of patient services. The key technological innovation is the facilitation of an ecosystem of chatbot designers and agents, through the creation of novel chatbot design, collaboration and deployment tools.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will create the technology to allow chatbot designers to incorporate human agents into the logical flow of chatbots. Currently, chatbots are designed in an ad-hoc trial-and-error manner, which is infeasible for small businesses who do not have the resources to constantly refine and evaluate their chatbots. The project will also create techniques to allow human agents to be productive when taking over chatbot sessions, and allow designers to improve the logical flow of chatbots based on usage data.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project can be summarized as follows. (1) Businesses will benefit from the proposed product because companies are increasingly using data-driven predictive models to improve their bottom line. In many areas where structured data are readily available, such as credit scoring, these models have produced impressive returns on investment. One of the main obstacles hindering the application of these models in other areas is the lack of structured data. By extracting information from sources such as web pages, blogs and social media messages, and storing it as structured data, companies will be able to take advantage of the vast amount of unstructured data that are generated daily and thereby improve their bottom line. (2) As the Chinese economy expands and becomes more deeply intertwined with the US economy, many US businesses will need high-quality and timely information about Chinese markets. However, information extraction from Chinese text is an underserved area. The proposed product can fill this void and thereby meet a significant commercial demand.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a new information extraction (IE) method. Currently IE focuses on information extraction from short text snippets consisting of a few words in order to derive structured factual information from unstructured text. But its performance is often deteriorated by the shortage of features - the sparse feature problem. A major benefit of the approach developed in this project is that it takes advantage of the important role of specific linguistic units even when the number of words in a sentence is limited. These linguistic units give a sentence its structure. Depending on structural characteristics or functional principles of sentences, the features around them are grouped. The grouped features satisfy certain properties and can be used to capture structural and semantic information, which is helpful for minimizing the sparse feature problem.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project focused on a novel seat design that reduces vehicle-based whole-body vibration and shock will 1) better protect human health while 2) addressing major transportation markets including trucking, agriculture, construction, military vehicles, and mass transit, as well as automobiles and water-/land-based recreational vehicles.  The envisioned socio-economic impact is significant:  Continual exposure to whole-body vibration and shocks can cause discomfort, reduction in work performance, and chronic low-back pain for vehicle operators and passengers.  Low-back pain is the largest component of disability among all occupational-related injuries. Though so-called "active" seats can help reduce these vibrations/shocks, their high cost is a major barrier. The low-cost seats being pursued here could benefit millions of vehicle operators. The work will also result in a greater scientific and technological understanding of the sources/effects of and potential remedies for whole-body vibration and shock. The suspension system market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 5.11%, by value, from 2016 to 2021. The market is expected to grow from USD 52.38 Billion in 2015 to USD 67.22 Billion by 2021.  The market for bus seats alone is expected to be at $10.03 Billion by the year 2022.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is focused on the feasibility of a quasi-semi-active seat (QSAS) technology.  Seating design for heavy equipment and vehicle operators has faced a trade-off between performance and cost. The most-complex 'active seats' reduce vibration but are cost-prohibitive at $3,500. Semi-active seats are simplified active seats and perform better than passive seats, but still magnify input vibration and cost several thousand dollars. Passive seats are the least expensive, but they magnify input vibration at low frequencies.  Recent design/material advances and strong preliminary data set the stage for developing an innovative passive seat at a fraction of the cost of semi-active seats that will reduce input vibration at low frequencies. Phase I feasibility will be shown using sliding friction to mitigate vibration at low frequency.  A QSAS prototype will be built and used to show potential in laboratory and field settings.  Technical challenges will involve material selection that will show maximum vibration mitigation and dissipation, as well as integration of the cushion with a suspension system that can handle the weight of a seated person. The research will determine effective performance parameters under different magnitudes and frequencies of vibration that simulate realistic operational conditions.

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase I project develops a bacterial platform for intracellular
    drug delivery to solid tumors, with a primary focus on liver cancer. Every year,
    30,000 men and women are diagnosed with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma
    (HCC), which has a 5-year survival rate of 17.6 %. The prognosis for these patients
    is poor. Currently, there are no curative treatments for these patients. The current
    standard-of-care only increases overall survival by months and has toxic side
    effects, with a cost to the US healthcare system of $1.5B per year. This technology
    is based on the inherent feature of bacteria to colonize solid tumors throughout
    the body in ratios of 100,000 to 1 compared to healthy tissue. Due to this specificity,
    the developed bacterial platform has the potential to increase dosage specifically
    in tumors, while reducing toxic side effects in healthy tissues. This platform
    will be a toolbox that can target intracellular pathways that are currently considered
    undruggable and deliver potent doses of biologicals directly into tumor cells.
    The affinity of bacteria for solid tumors, independent of organ localization,
    enables the extension of this delivery method to other hard-to-treat tumor types,
    such as pancreas, ovarian and gastric cancer. \n\nSystemic cancer therapies have
    many obstacles, such as stability in the blood, traversing the cellular membrane,
    internalization and endosomal release. These processes impede the use of RNAi
    and peptides in humans and hamper the targeting of intracellular pathways with
    monoclonal antibodies. The development of a bacterial drug delivery platform can
    optimize drug potency in tumors and reduce side effects in healthy tissue. In
    this SBIR phase I, efficacy of this platform will be measured in HCC by targeting
    intracellular pathways essential for cell survival, for which no systemic therapy
    exists. A bacterial strain will be created according to FDA guidelines that can
    be manufactured reliably without loss of activity. An optimized preservation protocol
    will be developed to ensure maximal bacterial fitness and maximal delivery efficacy
    after administration. This bacterial delivery system has the potential to accelerate
    the translation of fundamental cancer research into clinical therapies. Discoveries
    could be genetically translated directly into protein, antibody or shRNA therapies
    that regulate mammalian gene expression and function.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's

    This SBIR Phase I project aims to develop and demonstrate the feasibility of a system that can identify a broad range of bacteria in < 1 hour directly from blood. Existing diagnostic systems require 2-6 days to identify the bacteria, which delays treatment using appropriate antibiotics. Sepsis, which is often caused by a bacterial infection, contributes to up to half of all hospital deaths in the US largely due to complications arising from delays or inappropriate treatment (which is mainly because of lack of information regarding the infection-causing bacteria). It is the most expensive hospital-treated condition in the United States ? representing $20.3 billion in healthcare costs. The proposed system aims to sharply reduce the time to provide information needed by physicians, enabling them to initiate treatment using the appropriate antibiotic rapidly. This is expected to lead to significant reductions in costs, complications, and mortality. Further, by eliminating the need for culturing, new insights into bacterial behavior can be acquired contributing to additional fundamental knowledge of bacteria. This knowledge will aid antibiotic discovery efforts, improve understanding of mechanisms of drug resistance, support new biomanufacturing processes through faster detection of bacterial contamination of pharmaceutical products and foods, and characterization of the microbiome.

    The challenges of rapid bacterial identification are primarily in two areas ? sample preparation, that eliminates the need for culturing, and multiplex identification, to cover the diverse range of bacterial species capable of causing infection. The proposed work is based on leveraging the differential response between bacteria and the cells in a sample matrix to selectively break down the sample matrix, but not bacteria, such that the largest lysis debris is smaller than intact bacteria. The debris is subsequently separated from intact bacteria using a size-based technique enabling rapid isolation of a broad range of bacteria directly from the sample. A novel Fourier-transform infrared microspectroscopy system is then used to identify the isolated bacteria at clinically relevant concentrations. No bacteria-specific reagents are employed. The proposed Phase I work addresses the highest risk technical hurdles in the process. Isolating and detecting low concentration of bacteria directly from blood is accomplished through the three objectives of this project that optimize the purification and bacterial recovery from the sample, identification accuracy, and performance of the integrated system relative to the traditional culturing-based method.

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase I project will provide prototype products to satisfy
    customer needs in prioritized wearable sensor market segments for the endurance
    sports market. One advantage of the proposed sensor is its similar feel to cloth
    fabric, a benefit in comfort and convenience to the user.  This is in contrast
    to current hydration monitors made of thick plastic materials requiring the use
    of an additional wristband or adhesive patch.  This value proposition was developed
    and tested based on the findings of 374 customer interviews during a spring 2017
    NSF I-Corps workshop.  That study determined the commercial and product potential
    of a fabric sensor to monitor hydration.  In 2015 alone more than 17.1 million
    people finished endurance events.  According to interview data, 50% of respondents
    are interested in a hydration solution due to past dehydration and cramping issues.
    Additionally, 40% of respondents indicated interest in a technology-based solution.
    This group equates a target market of $342 million for a hydration monitor priced
    at $100 per unit, a good estimation of the total available market based on I-Corps
    interviews. In general, the data collected from the developed sensor could lead
    to better understanding of health and disease processes, including the analysis
    of common diabetic neurological complications, the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis
    (CF), and sweat monitoring for advanced prosthetic limb applications, bedridden
    patients, or athlete performance tracking leading to better treatments and health
    outcomes for all patients.  \n\nA monitor that analyzes the sodium concentration
    of a person's sweat would be able to notify them before they begin suffering from
    exercise-induced illnesses such as hypernatremia or hyponatermia. This early notification
    system would allow people to be on top of their hydration, and be able to replenish
    their electrolytes as needed, without overhydrating. The team has developed flexible,
    lightweight fabric materials that can selectively determine physiological information
    from sweat forming on the surface of the skin.  The technology is the first lightweight
    fabric sensor to provide real-time information regarding hydration levels during
    exercise or training. These dehydration patterns are unique and vary based on
    diet, weather conditions, and human physiological cycles. The ability to monitor
    an individual's hydration parameters is unique to the proposed sensor and gives
    it a competitive advantage over sweat monitors that monitor water lost or water
    timers that remind the athlete to drink water every 20 minutes.  Specifically,
    the proposed work will focus on the large-scale development of a hydration monitor,
    validation of the monitor during material testing and on the body in an exercise
    physiology laboratory, and leveraging partnerships with potential strategic partners.
    As athletes strive for peak performance, improper hydration can undermine their
    progress in both training and competitive settings.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's
    statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
    the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

    that can enables new drone sensing and sensor network applications in the energy,
    agricultural, and waste management sectors. Methane, the third largest energy
    source after petroleum and coal in the U.S., is relatively difficult and expensive
    to measure compared to other gasses. It is a major atmospheric pollutant, both
    as a component of smog and as a greenhouse gas. This technology can provide societal
    environmental benefits by helping reduce methane release into the environment
    through the ubiquitous sensing of small natural gas leaks, allowing companies
    to rapidly respond. This sensor system has the sensitivity of laser-based spectrometers
    but is smaller, lighter, and has lower power requirements at a price three orders
    of magnitude less than existing high-end spectrometers. Designed to reduce power,
    weight and cost to a minimum while not compromising sensitivity, this technology
    is ideal for UAV-based measurements. It can also give station mounted and handheld
    monitoring units high sensitivity at a lower price point, enabling multiple monitor
    sampling strategies and a multi-station networked array to track intermittent
    sources of methane leaks. This technology can provide novel capabilities to cost-conscious
    customers in the energy sector while opening up additional markets for agricultural,
    waste management, and safety products. A first prototype of this methane sensor
    successfully measured methane in nitrogen down to 10 ppm. The long-term objective
    is the creation of a commercially available low-cost, high precision methane sensor
    product line. SBIR project funding is enabling the transition of this promising
    sensor technology from a small business research and development project into
    the early commercialization stages of a valuable new product. \n\n\nThis SBIR
    Phase 1 project proposes to create a self-contained methane sensor system, smaller
    in size than a quarter, with the sensitivity of advanced laser spectrometers.
    Current methods of detection do not meet the needs of industry. They are either
    cheap, high power and low sensitivity, such as catalyst-based systems, or they
    are large, expensive, high power optical systems. There is a market need for methane
    sensors that improve upon size, weight and power, while still maintaining useful
    sensitivity and selectivity. The system consists of 3 primary modules: the replaceable
    or consumable sensor package, the sense electronics, and the data storage and
    communication system. Due to the extremely low power requirements of the sensor,
    clever design of the data and communications system is critical if the low power
    benefits of the sensor are to be realized in a product. Ultimately, the system
    will include wireless connectivity (Bluetooth, WiFi, 5G, Zigbee) for cloud and
    IoT data management. This design will be prototyped and will undergo performance
    measurements. Materials for methane sensing will be identified  The objective
    of SBIR Phase 1 is to produce an initial prototype sensor for methane-sensing
    that will be the focus of SBIR Phase II.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory

    Research (SBIR) project is to enable safe and reliable autonomous unmanned flight
    operations. Unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) are used in a growing number of applications
    requiring increased vehicle autonomy, such as indoor operations, civilian infrastructure
    inspection, precision agriculture and aquaculture, remote sensing, wildlife tracking
    and conservation, and package/medicine delivery. As the diversity and number of
    applications of autonomous UAS keep growing, platform-independent solutions to
    onboard autonomy become increasingly important. Potential market segments for
    the proposed technology are focused on the most challenging use cases such as
    last-mile delivery, urban infrastructure inspection, and passenger air vehicles
    (air ambulance, air taxi, air shuttle). Therefore, technological advances in platform-independent
    onboard autonomy, particularly for small unmanned aircraft systems (sUAS), can
    have a large positive societal impact by enabling safety and reliability of UAS.
    \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project investigates
    a universal flight management unit (FMU) for nonlinearly stable and robust autonomy
    of UAS, in a platform-independent manner. At present, there is a dearth of nonlinearly
    stable and robust flight stacks that are platform/model-independent and real-time
    implementable on existing hardware, particularly for sUAS. Two critical challenges
    to be overcome for reliable platform-independent autonomy of UAS are: (A) dynamic
    stability in the presence of constraints on onboard processors, sensors and actuators;
    and (B) robustness to dynamic external uncertainties (e.g., wind, weather) and
    internal causes (e.g., changing payloads, onboard faults). The scientific objectives
    of this Phase 1 research are: (1) onboard trajectory planning, control and navigation
    for autonomous operations of UAS to provide dynamic stability and robustness to
    disturbances and sensor noise; (2) embedded software-hardware integration of guidance,
    navigation and control algorithms with commercially available hardware to build
    a FMU for onboard autonomy; and (3) experimental verification and validation of
    this FMU on different quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle platforms, including a
    flying-wing platform. The underlying framework behind this platform-independent
    FMU will be nonlinearly stable and robust model-free control and estimation techniques
    that ensure safe and reliable autonomous operations.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is the development of a 3D fabrication technology that provides the benefits of 3D printing (i.e., rapid prototyping, the creation of complex 3D structures, etc.) for high-quality, single-crystal silicon and silicon carbide. The technique will compete with traditional photolithography-based semiconductor manufacturing for applications such as MicroElectroMechanical System (MEMS) sensors such as accelerometers in cell phones and vehicle airbags, silicon photonics used in optical communications networks and data centers, microfluidics for drug-discovery and other biomedical applications, and interposers for 3D integration of integrated circuits. The 3D fabrication technique is superior to traditional semiconductor fabrication in three ways: 1) Up to a 100X reduction in prototype manufacturing time, resulting in cost savings and increasing the speed of R&D cycles; 2) Significantly reducing CapEx by replacing multiple fabrication tools with one single tool; and 3) Creating complex 3D structures directly, significantly improving on the limited extruded 2D geometries available from photolithography-based fabrication. Additionally, the 3D manufacturing capability can be extended to macro-scale components and impact industries such as energy conversion and aerospace by providing complex 3D structures made from single-crystal silicon carbide for extreme high-temperature operation.

    The proposed project combines elements of advanced nonlinear optics with electrochemical etching of semiconductor materials to enable the 3D manufacturing technique for single-crystal silicon and silicon carbide. While the fundamental physical mechanism has been demonstrated in work leading up to this project, there are important questions remaining about control of the material removal process, the surface quality of the final structure, and the rate at which material can be removed. These questions need to be addressed to understand which applications of the 3D manufacturing technique are commercially viable. The technical objectives and tasks for this project have been designed to answer these questions through careful experimentation and, with the data obtained, identify the most promising applications to pursue. Experiments for both silicon and silicon carbide will be conducted that explore a range of permutations of input parameters and variables for the 3D manufacturing process. Results of these experiments will be studied and characterized to identify optimal etch parameters and the etch results possible with those etch parameters. At the conclusion of this Phase 1 STTR project, the capabilities of the 3D fabrication technique will be better understood and a clear path for commercializing the capability will be identified.

    of a Rechargeable Hybrid Aqueous Battery (ReHAB) containing a novel freeze tape
    cast zinc electrode that will contribute to meeting global battery demands.  The
    two chemistries dominating the majority of electrification markets are lithium-ion
    and lead-acid.  However, both of these chemistries have drawbacks, which include
    the low cycle life and energy associated with lead-acid batteries, and the high
    price and safety risks associated with lithium-ion batteries.  These drawbacks
    open the door for the ReHAB battery chemistry to become a drop-in replacement
    to the lead-acid and lithium-ion markets such as stationary, heavy trucking, data
    center backup, and industrial motive. The primary goal of the ReHAB battery will
    be to step into these established markets as a lower cost and safer replacement
    to current technologies. These target markets total more than $50 billion in annual
    sales and continue to grow.      \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
    Phase I project will advance the ReHAB battery by utilizing freeze tape cast (FTC)
    zinc electrodes. The ReHAB is an emerging, high efficiency rechargeable battery
    technology that utilizes the high specific energy density of lithium intercalation
    electrodes with affordable, nontoxic zinc electrodes.  The electrolyte is water-based
    and is more conductive than non-aqueous electrolytes, which makes ReHAB cells
    a safe, alternative battery for high rate applications.  Despite the enormous
    potential of the ReHAB technology, poor performance of commercially available
    zinc foil electrodes and difficulties with fabricating zinc plated electrodes
    have prevented practical implementation of the ReHAB battery.  The Phase 1 project
    will be comprised of three major tasks to advance the emerging technology and
    establish the novel FTC anode, including initial characterization of the FTC zinc
    electrode, fabrication of ReHAB pouch cells with the FTC electrode, and the initial
    performance of the chemistry under varying operating conditions. The FTC novel
    electrode is anticipated to provide directionally aligned active metallic struts
    that will allow for ordered zinc plating, help control shape change, and dramatically
    reduce dendrite formation due to a more homogeneously distributed current, which
    will provide much longer cycle life.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission

    application areas that are currently underserved by this premier analytical tool.
    The resulting method is capable of analyzing biological and environmental samples
    in <3 sec/sample directly from the biological matrix without instrument contamination.
    The method reduces cost, energy use, and required user expertise, while providing
    high sensitivity and speed of analysis with unprecedented robustness. These attributes
    address the need for accurate and timely information in medical diagnostics, biothreat
    detection, and environmental damage control among others.  This has the potential
    to advance science through improved measurement technology with societal benefits
    of improved healthcare, environmental remediation, and safety through sensitive,
    rapid, and reliable detection of drugs to proteins.  New instrumentation built
    around this technology has significant commercial potential because it addresses
    current shortcomings such as high cost, requirement for operator expertise, lack
    of robustness to contamination, and need for high-throughput automatable analyses,
    attributes that currently limit the appeal of mass spectrometry in important applications.
    \n\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes to advance mass spectrometry by implementing
    novel ionization technology first discovered in 2012 through NSF-funded research.
    The ionization process of this proposal converts large and small compounds regardless
    of volatility to gas-phase ions simply by exposure to sub-atmospheric pressure
    through association of the sample with certain small molecule compounds without
    the need for a laser, high voltage, or the application of heat.  A key feature
    is rapidly exposing successive samples to vacuum directly from atmospheric pressure
    providing simplicity of operation, speed of analysis, reduced operating cost,
    and elimination of risk of contamination.  The instrument and associated method
    are broadly applicable for fast analyses of a wide array of compounds, including
    drugs and their metabolites, and biological fluids and tissues without the need
    for purification and without instrument contamination.  Additional objectives
    include designing and building a novel sample introduction method for this new

    Phase I project redefines how Medicaid recipients access health care. Over 75
    million low-income Americans receive health care coverage through Medicaid, but
    socioeconomic barriers intrinsic to this population make it difficult to navigate
    the system. Many face challenges including housing insecurity, food poverty, substance
    abuse and lack of support that further inhibit the ability to obtain basic health
    care. Without earlier interventions, the most vulnerable individuals are prone
    to rely on hospital emergency departments for care - a vicious cycle that is costly
    to health care organizations and patients alike. Increasingly, community-based
    organizations (CBOs) such as food pantries, mobile health clinics, resource centers
    and shelters have emerged as survival touch points. As non-profits with limited
    resources, however, CBOs lack infrastructure for recordkeeping and reporting.
    The proposed technology addresses the data management needs of CBOs through a
    free and configurable web-based application that builds longitudinal profiles
    on the clients served. In turn, this application creates value for health care
    organizations by alerting care management teams when respective members visit
    a CBO and establishes a channel for earlier as well as preventive forms of engagement.
    \n\n\nThe proposed technology extends the reach of health care organizations into
    the communities where Medicaid members reside. This entails equipping CBOs with
    a free client management application that improves organizational bandwidth and
    access to funding through streamlined data reporting. On the back-end, a matching
    engine ingests member enrollment files from health care organizations and queries
    the CBO database for unique linkages. When matches are found, care management
    teams at health care organizations receive notifications on the status and location
    of difficult to reach as well as vulnerable members. Subsequently, they can communicate
    bidirectionally with CBO staff that directly serve Medicaid members and have stronger
    relationships. CBO staff are provided with guidance on best practices to engage
    their clients and effectively serve as extensions of the care team. With at least
    400,000 CBOs across the country, this approach has the potential to activate a
    vast network of existing infrastructure and dramatically improve care coordination
    for those on Medicaid. During this proposal period, an end-to-end solution will
    be implemented that links Medicaid members to their respective health care organizations
    and transforms CBOs into technology-enabled gateways to health care. Furthermore,
    the feasibility of the proposed technology will be evaluated for Phase II considerations.\n\nThis
    award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase I project aims at solving Benjamin Bloom's 2-Sigma
    Problem by building a web platform where community college professors and student
    tutors alike can remotely assist students with their courses. Most community college
    students are commuter students with jobs and families to cater to. They can't
    always be present on campus. The web platform would leverage existing resources
    on campus, professors' office hours and student learning centers' available tutors,
    to provide remote help to students. The project is inspired by Bloom's findings
    in 1984 where he demonstrated that students receiving tutoring performed better
    than 98% of their peers. However, such a system was not possible to implement
    at that time for all students because it would have required significant increase
    in education budgets for colleges. Hence, he labeled it the 2-Sigma problem and
    predicted that future technological advances will enable such a solution. The
    proposed web platform is indeed such a solution for community colleges nationwide.
    It may serve a critical national need for increased post-secondary credentials
    achievement to help prepare the future workforce by addressing the low graduation
    rates in community colleges nationwide. Increasing credentialed workers in the
    United States is imperative to sustain competitiveness as well as economic growth.
    The current graduation rate stands at less than 20% after 4 years spent in 2-year
    colleges and 70% of enrolled students leave community college without a degree.
    This negatively impacts economic growth in the United States, as 7 million jobs
    are currently unfilled. \n\nAttrition is correlated to accumulated learning deficiencies
    that build up throughout a semester. The proposed tutoring platform would help
    students catch up on poorly understood concepts as soon as they identify their
    learning deficiency by giving them the ability to ask questions directly to their
    instructor and get the immediate help they need before it's too late. The technical
    challenge resides in designing an intuitive, user-friendly remote tutoring platform
    that can achieve a high adoption rate among instructors and students in community
    colleges without any training. Many students have basic smartphones with limited
    memory and processing power. The solution needs to allow tutors to remotely communicate
    with students regardless of the quality of their connectivity. It also must convert
    technophobe instructors to contribute to the platform, as instructors' participation
    plays a critical role in the success of such a remote tutoring solution. The technology
    should also easily integrate with all existing information technology systems
    on campus and provide analytical capabilities to measure its impact on students'
    grades. Professors and student tutors will list modules online and schedule tutoring
    sessions that can take place synchronously or asynchronously. We will collect
    valuable chat/conversation data and then during phase II, apply Natural Language
    Processing, convert unstructured text into a structured format, and then apply
    machine learning algorithms to build a tutoring AI assistant that can be used
    for most disciplines.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been

    to create architecture for IT software with many-to-many relationships. The goal
    is to create layers of group interaction while balancing scalability with resiliency.
    This proposal is focused on building a new paradigm of software design that supports
    the concept of group to group information exchange, which will improve collaboration
    in democratic organizations. The main innovation is a software-based system for
    decentralized organizations, which will eventually be using blockchain. This paradigm
    would incorporate (a) Group to group and coalition formation; (b) Permissions
    supporting democratic/sociocratic/cooperative organizations; (c) The ability for
    users to connect more easily with each other in a more organized way (via existing
    communication tools) and exchange high-level information across groups while maintaining
    autonomy; and (d) Visibility into the matrix of group and coalition formation,
    which would enable all individuals better context for further coordination and
    decision-making. A decentralized app (Dapp) that allows the platform to be managed
    democratically with member/user decision making via blockchain will be developed
    during the potential Phase II.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission
    and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
    intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to provide a low cost Lidar+Thermal camera to the autonomous car market that will eventually enable level 4 and level 5 autonomy. The proposed innovation incorporates both a Lidar and a thermal detector to locate objects but also classify them, as this is the most crucial aspect of autonomous vehicles. The dual polarity Lidar+Thermal photodetector solves a few major issues in the current Lidar industry. First, current Lidars have to use advanced algorithms to classify the objects, whereas a Lidar+Thermal detector can easily distinguish between animate and inanimate objects, while continuing to establish their location. This is done due to the drastic heat signature of animate objects. Second, the dual polarity detector is able to detect and locate hazards on the road such as snow or puddles, which is vital if autonomous vehicles are used in northern regions. In addition, the frame rate of the Flash Lidar+Thermal is up to 200 Frames per second, which will drastically reduce smearing effects and allow for driving at speeds of 70+ MPH. Lastly, the high thermal resolution of the camera will ensure operation in bad weather conditions including fog and rain.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will provide a proof-of-concept of the dual polarity Lidar+Thermal detector. An array of 32x32 pixels will demonstrate that in one polarity, a thermal hot-mid-wave image and in the other polarity the pixels will operate in a time-of-flight mode for Flash Lidar operation. The pixel?s spectral response will range from 500nm up to 3.5?m in the Lidar mode. Characterization of the detector array will use the eye-safe 1550nm laser. The goal is to show a 200m Lidar operation with a high resolution of a few centimeters and thermal imaging with a thermal sensitivity of 4mK. The transition to Phase II will include an array size of 1000x500 with 10?m pixel pitch. The detector will be evaluated outdoors to demonstrate the detection of animate objects, snow and puddles and will be tested under fog conditions.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to enable a much wider adoption of various photomedical treatments.  Broadly speaking, photomedical treatments use light to cure diseases and promote healing.  Specifically, photodynamic therapy uses light to activate a photosensitizing chemical agent to kill cancer cells or bacterial with minimal side effects.  Moreover, photobiomodulation is the application of light to impaired or dysfunctional tissue to reduce pain and inflammation to speed healing and to promote or inhibit various cellular processes.  The light source is a critical part of any photomedical treatment system.  Existing sources such as lasers and LED arrays are bulky and expensive, generally require additional optics to deliver the light to the target treatment areas.  The current project aims to develop a photomedical treatment system based on a novel light source - quantum dot light emitting devices (QLEDs).  Flexible and large area QLEDs can be placed immediately adjacent to target treatment areas without additional optics.  Their simple driver requirements will result in much lower system costs and facilitate at-home use.  These QLED-based systems will enable the wider adoption of photomedical treatment methodologies, including in currently underserved areas and patient populations.

    The proposed project will leverage the recent invention of ultra-bright quantum dot light emitting devices (QLEDs) into a low-cost and convenient-to-use photomedical treatment system that will enable wider adoption of photomedical treatment methodologies for a variety of pathologies and use cases.  Project tasks include developing QLEDs with emitting spectra precisely tuned to match the absorption spectra of photosensitizers at 630 nanometers (nm), 635 nm and 660 nm; fabricating QLEDs on flexible substrates with device structures guided by microcavity simulations; developing a low DC voltage, current-controlled driver able to deliver a precise light dosage; and demonstrating the photomedical efficacy of thus developed QLEDs in a) ALA-PplX photodynamic therapy and associated dosimetry of oral malignancies using in-vitro 3D co-culture models of oral cancers; b) determining and optimizing parameters for photobiomodulation for wound healing applications including incisional and pressure ulcer wounds, in-vitro using multiple cell lines and models of cellular metabolism, cellular proliferation and scratch wound healing.  Successful completion of these tasks will result in a functional preliminary photomedical treatment system that lays the foundation for in-vivo animal studies of oral cancer or diabetic wound healing treatment paradigms in Phase II of the project.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to make walking both safer and easier for transfemoral amputees. Falling and fear of falling are pervasive in this population. Transfemoral amputees fall at a rate approximately 200 times that of healthy age-matched individuals, and they seek medical attention from falls at the same rate as the institution-living elderly. Such falls result most commonly from a lack of full knee extension in late swing, combined with a lack of knee proprioception, in which case the user enters a non-recoverable knee buckling state shortly after loading. This project proposes a knee prosthesis that provides a powered, motion-controlled knee swing which guarantees full knee extension prior to heel strike, and it therefore substantially reduces the likelihood of a fall. Further, powered knee movement lessens the need for compensatory movements, and therefore the effort required for walking is lessened. As a result, the proposed knee will provide safer and easier walking, enabling users to walk with greater confidence. The prosthesis will be reimbursable under current reimbursement codes and will result in improved mobility, health, and quality of life for end users.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project proposes a novel knee prosthesis that incorporates a hybrid approach to providing the two major functions of a knee prosthesis: stance and swing control. In this device, stance control is provided by a polycentric joint, while swing control utilizes a small motor for assistance. Consequently, the proposed device is called a polycentric swing-assist (PSA) knee. Unlike a passive extension aid employed in a typical polycentric knee, the swing-assist motor is able to aid both flexion in mid swing and extension in late swing. The PSA prosthesis is intended to inject small amounts of power during the swing phase of gait in order to guide the knee through the swing trajectory. Since the assistance is associated with low-torque and low-power movements, the motor, transmission, and battery can be small, lightweight, and quiet relative to a fully-powered knee prosthesis. The goal of this work is to design, construct, and test a PSA knee prototype. The efficacy of the prosthesis prototype will be compared to a commercial knee. The investigators will test whether or not the prosthesis better emulates healthy kinematics through outcome measures such as toe clearance and peak knee flexion across walking speeds.

    Research (SBIR) project is to help wastewater treatment plants become compliant
    with emerging environmental regulations, while saving energy and without adding
    cost.  It has potential to reduce the amount of biosolids that need to be shipped
    off-site and landfilled by up to 85% as well as completely destroy odors and pathogens.
    \ As a result, the project may also enhance social justice throughout the country.
    \ Currently, low-income and disadvantaged communities inherit waste from other
    communities, sometimes very far away from where the waste originated.  They inherit
    the stench, the vectors (rats, flies, birds) and toxins.  For example, 7% of the
    biosolids produced by New York City end up in Alabama, via trains and trucks.
    \ People living near the landfills and along transportation routes no longer use
    their porch because of the stench.  By improving the economics of a technology
    that destroys organics much better than state-of-the-art technologies, wastewater
    treatment plants will become cleaner, less malodorous and use less energy.  Other
    markets could open as well including clean power and chemical manufacturing. Finally,
    the project may lead to increased hiring of employees over the next three years.
    \n\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes to create an affordable and reliable process
    to cleanly and completely destroy organic waste, extract more resources and energy
    from sludge and biosolids at wastewater treatment plants while considerably reducing
    the amount of biosolids that need to be shipped off-site for disposal.  This objective
    will be achieved by improving a process that uses water contained within the waste
    to create a hyper oxidative environment.  Similar processes use costly and hazardous
    pure oxygen, are extremely energy intensive, and are plagued with high maintenance
    cost.  By making innovations in energy recovery, the use of air as an oxidant
    instead of oxygen is possible without the large cost associated with having to
    heat and compress an entire air stream- oxygen plus inert nitrogen. Once optimal
    technical conditions for energy recovery are identified, the project will enter
    the design and fabrication phases. The resulting new energy recovery module will
    be added to an existing system. The prototype will be tested for continuous operation.
    New insights into energy recovery will be gained, which will benefit the scientific
    community as a whole.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project centers on the possibility opened by plasma-activated water in dairy sanitation. Plasma activated water has several advantages: it is reusable and reduces the need to buy, store, and dispose of chemicals, it will not face antimicrobial resistance, unlike chemicals, and could be a faster disinfectant. In addition to replacing chemical disinfectants, plasma activated water could prove to be fast enough to allow for disinfecting the milking unit in-between individual cows, which should reduce the spread of mastitis within a herd, reducing the farmer's costs in terms of medicine, increased labor, and culling. By using plasma activated water as part of a milking system, cleaning could be automated as well as target spores in farm environments. The resulting reduction in costs, infection rate, manual labor & strain, and increase in milk quality, could revolutionize the dairy industry.

    This SBIR Phase 1 project proposes to research a method whereby plasma activated water replaces chemical disinfectants used in dairy milking machines. The dairy industry is facing two major problems relating to milking machines: first, a manual labor shortage, and secondly an ever-present threat of mastitis, an infection estimated to cost the industry $1B annually. These two problems come to a head at the milking machine, as current methods require cows to be manually cleaned before milking. The goal of this project is to explore whether plasma activated water could be an effective replacement for teat dips, aiming to design a self-cleaning milking attachment for existing machines, and clean the cows with PAW prior to milking. In Phase I, the focus will be on building a basic prototype to check sanitation capabilities, and compatibility with a farm environment. Future research would include a longer-term study of animals and track infection rates before and after.

    The broader impact and commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project will be the research and development of a new class of extremely portable deployable structures that allows easier transportation and simplifies the deployment of bulky structure. This fundamental technology covers a wide variety of potential commercial products including large easily transported rescue equipment and large tents for earthquake and other widespread humanitarian disaster scenarios; large space satellite structures such as antennas and optical arrays; large deployable UAV wings; large volumes for habitation or material storage; piping for water, sewage, oil or gas. This technology can help save lives during disasters, ease the transportation of potable water, sewer and energy with lower construction and deployment costs.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) phase I project will entail the systematic analysis and development of a novel highly compact, rapidly deployable composite tube technology. The challenge is to harness and combine the extremely energy dense properties of chemical combustion with a photocuring high-performance structural composite material to create an easily transported structure that can be rapidly deployed.  The project will entail experiments to better understand the polymer material properties and tailor them to the electromagnetic spectrum emitted by the combustion. Customization of an adhesive that will combine the necessary viscosity, structural and curing properties. A multiphysics simulation, validated with laboratory experiments, will be used to predict the technology's limitations.  The qualifying components will be utilized in a refined design and evaluated by manufacturers for large scale production. These efforts will culminate in scale prototype construction and testing.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to significantly lower the cost and expand the number of addressable markets for ice thermal energy storage. Cost effectively storing energy is imperative to a sustainable future. Storage can provide reliable access to power from intermittent renewable sources, increase the resiliency of the grid to weather events or terrorist attacks, and increase the utilization efficiency of existing assets, deferring costly upgrades. Today, ice thermal storage systems help building owners shift cooling loads from costly peak hours to when electricity is less expensive. Unfortunately the upfront cost of these systems, driven by the large cost of the cooling coil used to generate ice, prevents adoption from many users and has unduly restricted the number of addressable markets for ice thermal storage. Elimination of ice buildup on the cooling coil would reduce the size of the coil, and more importantly significantly lower the cost of these systems. Low-cost ice thermal energy storage could greatly improve the economics for long-duration energy storage technologies such as pumped thermal energy storage.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to translate the discovery of surfaces with zero ice adhesion into a cooling coil that can be integrated into a functioning ice thermal energy storage system. In order to repel ice, these surfaces require complete submersion in an immiscible oil phase, making coil geometry and overall system development challenging. At the beginning of this project, various plate and tube based cooling coil geometries will be systematically prototyped and refined, measuring the freezing and melting heat transfer efficiencies. Different formulations of the surface coating will be tested as well. The most promising candidate geometries will be charged and discharged over multiple cycles as part of an ice thermal energy storage system. The results from cycling will be compared to conventional ice-on-coil technology using metrics such as energy density and heat transfer efficiency. An ice shedding cooling coil, at less than a third of the size of an ice-on-coil system, is expected to deliver improved cooling performance. Demonstration of an ice shedding cooling coil in a functioning ice thermal energy storage system will prove the technology?s readiness to scale.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to develop disease resistant soybean varieties that will reduce the substantial losses in agricultural production caused by plant diseases.  Loss to disease can be as high as 40% globally and cost billions of dollars annually. In soybean alone, an estimated $3 billion dollars of production value is lost from plant diseases annually.  In addition, the destruction of crops by plant diseases threatens global food security and has a significant negative impact on the environment due to the use of pesticides. Application of a tunable, broad-spectrum disease resistance strategy in agriculturally important crops will have a major societal impact by protecting crops from devastating diseases for which alternative solutions are not currently available, securing agricultural production, and reducing environmental pollution from agricultural chemicals.  In the future, the goal is to apply the proposed technology to other agriculturally important crops such as corn, rice, and tomato.

    The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase I project is to engineer tunable, broad-spectrum disease resistant soybean varieties. In this project, a soybean immune regulatory cassette will be constructed through sequence homology, and then functionally validated by demonstrating pathogen-inducible resistance against various diseases with minimal yield penalty. The methods that will be used in this project include bioinformatic analysis of soybean sequences to identify homologous defense genes and corresponding regulatory elements, molecular cloning, transformation of both Arabidopsis and Soybean plants, and testing the resulting transformant plants to determine levels of resistance to different types of pathogens. Results from this project will be essential for moving forward with larger field trials, which to be accomplished in the Phase II of the project.

    This SBIR Phase I project will develop an innovative imaging device that applies tactile sensing to the surface detection of vertebrae to help clinicians place needles for the nearly 13 million diagnostic and therapeutic spinal punctures performed in the United States each year. The standard of care involves manual palpation of the back to estimate a vertebral gap for needle insertion. This technique is highly inaccurate, often requiring multiple attempts, which lead to pain and complications, unpredictable procedure times, poor throughput, and high rates of referrals to radiology for fluoroscopic guidance. By offering an accurate means of localizing bony landmarks, this project will enable successful insertion in fewer attempts, thereby improving clinical outcomes and reducing costs across the $3.2 million market, including emergency medicine, neurology, anesthesiology, and pain medicine. The device can also be introduced for training and to reduce errors in clinical testing of intrathecal drugs; and can increase procedure access by offering an alternative, bedside solution for challenging cases. To date, tactile imaging has only been applied clinically to soft-tissue evaluations. This project will pave the way for expanded use of this low-cost, non-radiative modality; to possibly replace palpation for other procedures, such as joint injections and thoracenteses.

    The innovation is the first standalone, clinical tactile imager. Its imaging subsystem comprises a sensitive, high-resolution pressure-sensing array, which detects vertebral landmarks when pressed against the back, and communicates them as a 2D pressure map to an integrated display. The device also includes a novel needle guide, which allows for flexible and reliable insertion. Positive gap localization has been verified in early development. This project will first confirm accurate insertion relative to imaging output by characterizing the relationship between guide and visualized-landmark locations, and by developing a mechanism to stabilize the device over unpredictable lumbar curvatures. Next, 2D pressure information will be evolved into an optimally robust and intuitive image. Advanced algorithms will be developed to detect, track, and highlight features of interest; and to understand and predict device use across cases. At each stage, the device will be tested on phantoms and through IRB testing on anesthesiology patients. Performance will be evaluated across anatomical variations, and compared with the standard of care. The resulting device will have demonstrated feasibility as a comprehensive spinal-puncture localization and insertion solution, rendering it suitable for further development and testing toward a regulatory submission, and providing compelling evidence for continued optimization in Phase II.

    This STTR Phase 1 project seeks to develop an automated system that would significantly increase the speed and accuracy of biopsy assessments at the point of care. The proposed technology eliminates extensive manual tissue processing steps and generates digital images of fresh biopsies that look just like standard pathology slides. The imaging can be performed in seconds, thus improving the efficiency of biopsy assessments at the point of care. Rapid, whole fresh biopsy imaging also improves evaluation accuracy while maximally preserving tissue for further testing and facilitating remote pathology consultation. With over five million patients in the United States undergoing biopsy procedures each year, and one in five of those patients returning for repeat procedures due to inaccuracies in biopsy assessments, an increase in accuracy and procedure speed could have a profound impact. This could lead to decreases in patient procedure time and decreases in repeat procedure rates, preventing unnecessary, painful, and invasive repeat biopsy procedures. With an estimated 1.6 billion USD spend on repeat procedures per year, this would also represent a significant decrease in financial burden on patients. In addition, due to the decrease in time per procedure, this could increase procedure throughput for hospitals, thus increasing hospital revenue potential. Finally, by producing remotely viewable images, this system could be utilized in a remote pathology setting at underserved communities within the US.

    This STTR Phase I project seeks to develop an automated sample processing and tissue pathology imaging system that delivers biopsy-to-image in a completely automated manner on fully-intact fresh tissues within five minutes of tissue removal.  Through integration with the previously developed Video-Rate Structured Illumination Microscopy (VR-SIM) system as the integrated optical sectioning modality, and using novel fluorescence dye combinations that recapitulate gold-standard histology,  the throughput, efficiency, and accuracy of biopsy evaluation can be improved while maximally preserving tissue for downstream processing and readily facilitating telepathology consultation. Preliminary work in multiple fresh tissue preparations, including core-needle biopsies and whole surgical resections,  indicates that the technology and method can deliver high image quality and diagnostic accuracy in short, clinically-relevant timeframes. A prototype of an automated, disposable cartridge system for biopsy staining and imaging for effortless integration with VR-SIM imaging will be developed. Image quality will be optimized at the highest optical sectioning power to be equivalent to physically-sectioned tissues, using polarization-gated VR-SIM and novel immersion media. ADPL workflow testing, validation of diagnostic image quality, and verification of compatibility with downstream analysis in human biopsy samples will be completed.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to reduce the power required to cool the data and telecommunications centers that drive the internet age. Currently nearly 2.0% of the energy consumed in the United States is used to run such data centers and, often, half of this is used for cooling. The corresponding greenhouse gas emissions will also be reduced. Longer term this technology can be adapted to increasing the efficiency of air-conditioning/refrigeration and power generation. Commercially, the computational fluid dynamics software market the product will compete in is projected to grow from $1.3 billion at present to over $2 billion by 2022. It will also stimulate the growth of the manufacture of specialty heat sinks with optimal geometries for efficient thermal management.

    This intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase I project is based on proposing to hybridize three common numerical methods, i.e., computational fluid dynamics (CFD), flow network modeling (FNM) and multi-variable optimization (MVO), a non-trivial objective. The result will be a software platform that can accurately and simultaneously optimize the geometry of an array of heat sinks found in various types of circuit packs, e.g., blade servers in data centers. This is not possible with CFD alone as it is too slow and it is not possible with FNM alone as it is not sufficiently accurate. The method of the hybrid approach to preserve the accuracy of CFD is to embed pre-computed, non-dimensional look-up tables of flow and thermal resistances from CFD simulations in an FNM. The software will accommodate both single-phase flows of air and water and evaporating/boiling flows of water and refrigerant, which requires modeling complex heat, mass and momentum transport phenomena. Experiments will validate its accuracy on thermal mock-ups of circuit packs.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to reduce the power consumption of display and lighting products by 90%. It will do so by enabling the pervasive use of light emitting diodes (LEDs) in such products. LEDs consume substantially less power than other display/lighting technologies and also offer benefits such as superior picture or lighting quality and longer lifespan. The foremost barrier to the emergence of such products is the difficulty of economically placing large quantities of LEDs onto a product grid. For example, if current-day methods are used to create a full high definition display, its assembly would take about a month and drive its cost far beyond what the market could accept. This project's innovation addresses this problem with a laser-based, ultra-high speed LED placement solution. Beyond this immediate application, it will further the industry's technical capabilities relative to electronics component assembly in general. The commercial potential for chip-based LED display and lighting products is expected to reach about $10 billion within five years. The market for LED placement solutions in support of these products will be about $1 billion in this same time frame.

    The proposed project addresses the above problem by demonstrating an ultra-high speed LED placement method that can reduce the one month assembly time in the example above to just one minute. This solution, unlike others in development, increases the placement rate of LEDs by a factor of 10,000 and includes the ability to pre-screen and replace non-functional LEDs. This project will demonstrate the core aspect of this solution involving the placement of multiple, very small LEDs ("microLEDs") using a single laser pulse diffracted into multiple scanned beams. It will use this solution to demonstrate the extremely fast assembly of a quantum dot-based microLED display. The project will build upon a related, previously demonstrated capability applied to larger, silicon dies. Each aspect of the technology (wafer preparation, single laser beam placement, multi-beam placement) will be individually optimized for the new conditions imposed by the smaller sized, sapphire-based microLEDs. This new, LED-tailored capability will then be used to demonstrate the assembly of a four thousand pixel microLED display in under one second thereby achieving the project's goal of demonstrating a >50M units/hour LED placement rate.

    The broader impact/commercial impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) project is to reduce the environmental impact of agricultural production while optimizing net income to producers. Over-application of nitrogen fertilizer contributes to groundwater contamination via nitrate-nitrogen leaching, and puts substantial financial burden on rural municipalities and private well owners who are required to install and pay for treatment of their drinking water. An estimated 1% of global energy consumption is attributed to the production of synthetic nitrogen fertilizer. Producers operate under tight margins, and face pressure to maximize crop yields to remain profitable and sustain their business. The proposed technology aims to optimize nitrogen application and minimize the susceptibility of loss to the environment, while accounting for the year to year weather variability that poses the largest production challenge. The technology not only determines the optimum nitrogen rate for achieving maximum profit, but it also provides transparency in nitrogen management and can serve as a means for demonstrating compliance with incentive or regulatory programs.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to refine and test a novel algorithm for making real-time nitrogen fertilizer recommendations during the growing season using remote sensing. The need for this technology is rooted in the issue that producers are not satisfied with current methods for in-season nitrogen management because of lack of accuracy and poor temporal and spatial resolution. The research objectives of this project are to: (i) predict crop nitrogen concentration using multispectral information, (ii) compare the algorithm to conventional methods, (iii) calibrate and validate a crop growth model for prediction of above-ground biomass, (iv) develop predictive algorithms for radiation use efficiency, and (v) optimize the algorithm and develop a software application suitable for use by producers. The algorithm needs to account for yearly variability in crop growth dynamics caused by climatic conditions, crop variety, and nitrogen management practices. A field experiment will be conducted to collect data necessary to evaluate these objectives. It is anticipated that this technology will perform with reasonable accuracy and have similar or superior performance to existing N management methods, making it a vast improvement over current practices because of its ability to consider spatial and temporal variability in a scalable manner.

    Research (SBIR) project is to develop mechanized clothing technology to reduce
    physical disability, healthcare costs and missed work for material and package-handlers
    in the logistics industry. Workers in this industry are at high risk of developing
    low back pain (LBP) due to the physical demands of repeated leaning and lifting.
    There are currently no solutions for this occupation that are effective, affordable,
    practical and unobtrusive. This project is focused on mechanized clothing, a game-changing
    new device to reduce fatigue and incidence of low back pain amongst material/package-handlers
    and other occupations that involve repetitive lifting and leaning. For employers,
    mechanized clothing creates the potential for a happier, healthier and more productive
    workforce with reduced employee turnover, medical costs and understaffing issues.
    For workers, mechanized clothing means the potential for less low back pain, fatigue
    and missed work. For society, it means the potential to improve well-being for
    millions of individuals worldwide and to reduce the burden on the healthcare system
    and reliance on painkillers.\n \nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop
    an exoskeleton that is able to integrate into the normal workflow of material/package-handlers.
    Mechanized clothing has been shown in lab tests to reduce loading on the low back.
    The key to demonstrating commercial feasibility is proving to logistics companies
    that their workers can be assisted in a real world environment without interfering
    with daily workflow. The SBIR project plan is to (i) design a multi-stage clutch
    to prepare for real-world testing; (ii) use a robotic emulator system in the lab
    to quantify optimal assistive spring stiffness for leaning and lifting biomechanics,
    to inform spring selection in the new mechanized clothing prototype; and (iii)
    demonstrate feasibility of device integration into a real-world package-handling
    environment by testing users with the mechanized clothing prototype and assessing
    the degree to which it can assist users without hindering workflow.\n\nThis award

    This SBIR Phase I project will advance novel techniques for developing high-resolution noninvasive brain imaging systems, capable of recording unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution inferences of the brain activity for a portable system.  These systems leverage novel fundamental analysis and results, and experimental demonstrations, that show that spatial resolution of Electroencephalography (EEG) is not saturated at densities of a few hundred electrodes, unlike what has been widely believed in clinical and neuroscience community.  They also build on recent work by the PIs that enables faster and reliable acquisition of EEG signals. The success of the proposed work will help diagnose worsening brain injuries before the injury occurs. Brain injuries affect 1.7 million Americans every year. Commercially, it will enable higher resolution brain-machine interfaces for applications such as virtual reality interfacing and neuroprostheses, generating novel avenues for jobs and revenue through creation of an entirely new industry.  This transdisciplinary effort brings together neuroscientists and engineers and the concepts developed in this effort will inform material for basic neuroscience and neuroengineering courses.  The team will continue to publish and publicize their work at clinical conferences.  One of the core employees will be a minority female who has contributed to the research, guided several other minority (and non-minority) female students, and now wants to lead the development end of this project.

    This effort builds a systematic platform that challenges the widely held belief that increasing electrode-densities of EEG to beyond a few hundred electrodes does not improve spatial resolution. There are several problems with the traditional EEG that the platform overcomes: (i) typically only 9-32 electrodes are used for clinical diagnoses and these are fundamentally limited to only providing poor spatial resolution; (ii) because traditional EEGs have low resolution, surgical treatments often require invasive procedures. E.g., for diagnosing severity or worsening of Traumatic Brain Injuries (TBI) by measuring parameters of cortical spreading depolarizations (CSDs), which are mediators of worsening brain injuries; (iii) long-term EEG measurements are cumbersome, and high-density systems can take hours of manual labor to install. The PIs' preliminary work provides strong evidence supporting the claim that ultra-high-density EEG will provide the first non-invasive and portable modality for high spatial and temporal resolution brain imaging.  Novel brain-imaging algorithms will be developed and benchmarked against existing techniques and assessed using novel fundamental limits.  Novel techniques will be deployed in the design of conductive sponges and in lowering power, enabling the platform to be portable and usable over long term.  These improvements will be rigorously tested through simulations, experiments, and real data analysis.

    This SBIR Phase I project will help advance the health and welfare of individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS) - a debilitating chronic inflammatory disease affecting nearly 1 million people in the United States. A non-invasive, wearable retinal imaging device will be developed for at-home patient use that detects changes in MS disease activity, enabling patients and their physicians to track responses to treatment and detect disease flare-ups between clinical visits. Early detection and proper treatment of MS is crucial to reducing the risk of disease progression and disability. Current practice relies on infrequent neurological and radiological exams to assess changes in disease activity and treatment efficacy. However, there is currently no way to monitor MS in real time between these visits. Research relating retinal pathology to MS processes in the brain demonstrate that retinal imaging can provide early detection of disease events, offering an alternative monitoring pathway. This device will thus help reduce increases in patient healthcare costs associated with increasing disability, and potentially impact the research and care of patients with other brain conditions that manifest in the retina, including traumatic brain injury, epilepsy, and addiction. Following FDA approval, the device will be sold to MS patients, neurologists, and researchers.

    This project will yield a novel retinal imaging device that uses optical coherence tomography (OCT) and fundus autofluorescence (FAF) to assess retinal biomarkers associated with MS progression. While OCT and FAF are widely-used modalities for imaging the retina, the proposed device differentiates itself from current technologies in that it is specifically designed for use by MS patients at home. This will include a ruggedized, ergonomic, and wearable design suited for those who suffer from low mobility and other symptoms that make trips to a clinic difficult. Patients will use the device briefly once a week, during which time retinal images will be automatically acquired, analyzed, and sent to a physician for remote review. As such, it will further increase engagement between patients and physicians by making patients more proactively involved in their disease management. For this project, the following objectives are planned: 1) Develop the OCT component of the device to acquire high-resolution and repeatable images of layers in a healthy tissue-mimicking phantom retina, 2) Develop the FAF component of the device, and 3) Validate the device?s ability to acquire high-resolution and repeatable images of retinal layer thicknesses and autofluorescence in post-mortem retinas from MS patients and healthy individuals.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase I project aims at developing a roll-to-roll, solid-state, continuous process for manufacturing nanocellular thermoplastic films with open (interconnected) or closed (not interconnected) cells of the order 10-100 nm and as much as 50% porosity. The initial application of this proposed project is an improved Lithium-ion battery separator comprising a nanoporous polyetherimide (PEI) film of 10-25-micron thickness with uniformly distributed interconnected 10-50 nm size cells. The nanoporous PEI separator, which has significantly higher heat resistance than current polyolefin-based separators, addresses a very urgent safety issue, i.e., batteries exploding and causing fire due to thermal instability of the separator. Moreover, compared to the current multi-step process for fabricating battery separators, this continuous process will have higher productivity thereby increasing the nation's global competitiveness in battery manufacturing. The total addressable global market for separators used in both primary (single-use) and secondary (rechargeable) lithium batteries is projected to be $1.65 billion by 2020 growing at 4.7%. This innovative research project will contribute to new knowledge in the areas of gas diffusion and cell nucleation in thermoplastic polymeric films and enable development, characterization and application of a whole new class of solid-state nanocellular polymer films.

    The intellectual merit of this project resides in the development of a manufacturing process that brings together interdisciplinary knowledge to synthesize and characterize nanostructures under various process conditions. This new knowledge will advance the field of nanomanufacturing and will be used to optimize processes towards commercialization targets. There are two technical challenges: (i) the dynamic seal concept, which has been proven in a 250-micron thick polymer film but not for a film 10-20 times lower in thickness; and (ii) maintaining enough gas concentration during the cell nucleation and growth to create nano-sized cells. The goals of this project are to: (a) establish the feasibility of a roll-to-roll process operating at a minimum speed of 1 meter/minute to produce nanocellular thermoplastic films and (b) develop a 100-mm wide, 10-25 micron thick nanoporous polyetherimide (PEI) film having the desired properties and nanostructure profile for a Li-ion battery separator application. These two goals will be achieved by implementing the dynamic seal technology to process a 100-mm wide film on a continuous basis and immediately heating the film to create nanocells.

    This SBIR Phase 1 project will create an educational technology that accelerates the acquisition of foundational English language skills by children (4 to 10 years old), by melding English and Spanish language instruction, delivered via a personalized digital learning platform. Using state-of-the-art text-to-speech and speech-to-text engines, students that are English Language Learners (ELL) will engage in deliberate literacy practice across the four modalities of language (listening, speaking, reading, writing). Over the last decade, the number of ELL students enrolling in public schools has steadily increased while there remains a shortage of bilingual or certified ELL teachers. Technology can help these teachers to personalize instruction and extend the school day which in turn increases engaged learning time. Achieving college and career readiness is an economic imperative for all students, especially ELL students given the importance of English communication skills to career success. While developing technologies for use in classrooms by young children can be a risky proposition due to the nature of the modern classroom, the reward far outweighs the risk. This project will produce a high-impact technology solution designed for young children that integrates the latest text-to-speech and speech-to-text technologies and is grounded in sound research about language skill acquisition across the four modalities.

    The key innovation of this SBIR Phase 1 project is a plurilinguistic (e.g., Spanish and English) approach to literacy development across the four modalities of language (e.g., reading, writing, speaking, listening) where young students (aged 4-10 years old) are immersed in personalized learning experiences specifically tailored to support and accelerate language development. The first research goal is to test the feasibility for using and adapting proprietary English and Spanish language text-to-speech and speech-to-text engines with young children. The second research goal is to examine the impact of a dual-language personalized learning platform on children?s acquisition of foundational listening, speaking, reading, and writing skills. Participants will be ELL students whose first language is Spanish. The research is based on a plurilinguistic framework for second language acquisition; researchers hypothesize that a dual-language application that leverages students' first language to learn English will score significantly higher on independent measures of foundational literacy skills and self-efficacy for learning compared to students who are using an English-only personalized learning application. A mechanism of growth may be the amount of time students are immersed in deliberate practice of literacy skills. A dual-language personalized learning platform has the potential to extend teacher-led literacy instruction and increase the amount of time students spend engaged in learning English.

    facilitate retinal screening at primary (non-ophthalmologist) points of care.
    Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness in Americans aged 20-74.
    Delivering efficient and cost-effective retinal screening to the millions of at-risk
    patients is both imperative and a pressing engineering challenge. This project
    will test a unique lens design and imaging method as the first steps toward building
    an intuitive, affordable hand-held retinal imager specifically targeted to primary
    care physicians and non-ophthalmologist healthcare providers.  Enabling widespread
    diabetic retinopathy screening at primary points of care will bring preventive
    screening to previously under served patient populations, including poor urban
    and rural areas. Allowing primary care physicians to offer these services will
    reduce the workload for over-burdened eye specialists. Freeing up specialists’
    time and resources to be utilized more efficiently will also reduce costs to the
    healthcare system. \n\nThis project seeks to develop a novel lens geometry that
    will enable more efficient illumination of the retina during imaging. The company's
    innovative and improved methodology will decrease imaging failure along with device
    size and cost, resulting in increased reliability, retinal screening efficiency,
    and accessibility. This project builds on empirical insights into the pitfalls
    and failure modes of retinal screening. Lenses with the novel geometry will be
    prototyped, and the optical performance of the lens and illumination system will
    be tested using physical and biological eye models. Briefly, computational modeling
    will be used to predict the properties (e.g., uniformity of retinal illumination)
    of candidate lens geometries challenged with a 5 mm aperture. Next, a physical
    prototype for the optical and electronic components will be assembled, followed
    by proof-of-concept tests with physical and biological models of the eye to compare
    the performance of prototype lenses to predicted values. These critical results
    will guide the company’s efforts to refine its design, transition from prototype
    to production model for cost-effective manufacturing, and to plan pilot trials
    as it moves this hand-held retinal imager toward the clinic.\n\nThis award reflects

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research project will be to enable new robotics systems with actuator hardware that is substantially lighter and less expensive than the current state-of-the-art. The high cost and limited performance of actuators are the greatest problems for engineers developing products for mobile applications, such as package delivery, security, disaster recovery, and wearable assistive devices, causing the market to bifurcate into low-cost robots with extremely limited functionality or versatile robots costing tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars. Clutches are an important way to reduce actuator requirements and costs, but conventional clutches are large, heavy, and power-hungry, ultimately negating potential improvements. In this project, we will develop an electro-adhesive clutch that is 10x lighter and uses 1000x less power than conventional clutches. This hardware innovation allows robotics engineers to use clutches with almost no mass or power consumption penalties. Removing this constraint will have a substantial impact on the commercial viability of robots that are both capable and affordable.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will consist of the design and characterization of a compact rotary electro-adhesive clutch. This work will build on recent accomplishments in creating and characterizing the linear electro-adhesive clutch design to move toward a rotary design integrating with existing robotic joints with minimal required hardware changes. The objectives of this work are to experimentally optimize the effect of materials and design choices on the performance of the rotary electro-adhesive clutch, and to establish performance metrics to evaluate the feasibility of commercial use. Design work will include simulation, mass optimization, and exploration of fabrication techniques. The experimental work will characterize the system in terms of maximum torque, power, and speed testing, response time and dissipation testing, and preliminary fatigue and wear experiments.

    Research (SBIR) project addresses biofouling (unwanted attachment of aquatic organisms,
    e.g. barnacles) of ships . Current antifouling methods are both harmful to the
    environment and costly. Toxic paints may pollute our seas and waterways. Maintenance
    to mitigate biofouling is labor-intensive, expensive, and somewhat hazardous.
    Increases in fuel costs due to frictional drag during a vessel’s operation can
    approach 40%.  This project will develop an innovative electronic approach to
    biofouling prevention by developing submersible ultrasonic transducer arrays optimized
    for low voltage operation in a marina.   The near-term commercial opportunity
    is with both marina owners and larger marina nationwide operators, with long-term
    opportunities in commercial and naval military transport, a total addressable

    (SBIR) Phase I project will address the challenges for commercial deployment of
    transducer arrays to prevent biofouling of ships docked in marinas, and will enhance
    the scientific understanding of acoustic wave generation in water using piezoelectric
    transducers and the opportunity to use shock waves to prevent the attachment of
    bio-species to hulls of ships.  The program has four scientific objectives:   1)
    Define the maximum fouling-free area and distance possible with a single, ultrasonic
    transducer mounted 30 to 50 cm underwater, on target surfaces 1 to 15 meters distant.
    \ 2) Achieve low-voltage operation required for commercial deployment, using new

    sensor in a waterproof housing to create a coherent array for full coverage.  4)
    Develop a prototype electronically steerable array demonstrating a significantly
    larger biofouling-free area than a fixed transducer element, to enable use on
    larger ships, such as commercial and military transport.  A beam-steering solution
    will reduce the required number of transducers for increased functionality.  The

    The broader/commercial impact of this SBIR project is to validate the technical and commercial viability of developing a novel fermented food to address underlying mechanisms associated with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS).  IBS is a highly disruptive and prevalent disease afflicting approximately 32 million Americans. Technically, the ability to rationally design a novel fermented food with defined strain content and specific health and nutritional benefits will be validated for the first time. Commercially, the taste and acceptability for consumers will also be verified to ensure strong market demand for the product. If successful, this proposal will more broadly validate a novel platform for designing rationally fermented foods with a variety of desirable properties, including improved health and nutritional qualities, more robust preservation, and targeted removal of specific compounds/toxins. Although the initial disease target is IBS, there are many other chronic diseases with strong associative links to the microbiome; these now constitute 90% of U.S. health care spending (nearly $4 trillion) and present an urgent area for innovation that this platform could powerfully impact, both domestically and abroad.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to develop a new platform to precisely engineer novel fermented foods with defined microbial and metabolite content to improve human health. Fermented foods have great promise to impact the host gut and microbiome through a variety of established mechanisms, and have the advantage of high, metabolically active doses of microbes and the ability to deliver multiple strains along with their associated bioactive metabolites. However, a key technical hurdle is that it is not currently possible to precisely define the strain and metabolite content of a fermented food.  This proposal addresses this challenge by leveraging recent advances in microbial strain isolation, genomic characterization and high throughput screening. First, next-generation strain isolation techniques will be applied to food-borne microbes to develop a large and deeply characterized biobank of previously inaccessible microbial strains. The strains will then be screened for activity on specific host and microbiome mechanisms. Lead strains will then be formulated into a food at commercial scale, and the presence of the strains as well as retention of their associated health properties will be confirmed. Finally, the taste profile will be validated.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to develop special metal-free catalysts to dramatically reduce chemical manufacturing costs. In addition, these catalysts significantly expand the range of light-driven reactions, leading to profound advancements in pharmaceuticals, healthcare, agriculture, biology, material science, and other industries. Because light-driven chemical technology predominantly relies on scarce and expensive precious metal catalysts, it is limited today to small-scale R&D applications only. At scale, light-driven technology using metal-free catalysts can greatly reduce chemical manufacturing costs by replacing conventional reactions that rely on expensive precious metals, which are also limited to specific classes of reactions. This new chemistry will significantly expand the possibilities for applications of light-driven chemical technology, leading to novel products and greater consumer access through lower costs.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to demonstrate the suitability of metal-free (organic) photoredox catalysts (PCs) in challenging and important pharmaceutical reactions. Organic PCs are key enablers of photoredox catalysis, an emerging field of chemistry gaining significant traction in drug development. Driven by light absorption, photoredox catalysis offers significant advantages over conventional heat-driven methods (e.g. Pd catalysis), including cost, ease of use, and broadened fields-of-use. Importantly, organic PCs are sustainable and scalable alternatives to predominantly used precious metal PCs, allowing photoredox catalysis to extend to full industrial use, including drug manufacturing. To spur industrial adoption of photoredox catalysis, research objectives include proving feasibility of organic PCs in medicinally important reactions, while expanding substrate scope to include biologically relevant and highly functionalized substrates typically used in drug designs. Photoredox-catalyzed reactions powered by organic PCs will access new chemistries beyond capabilities of conventional heat-driven catalysis. In addition, guided by quantum simulations, new high-performance organic PCs will be developed with unique properties beyond those reported in the literature, unlocking new transformations.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to pinpoint a mobile device with greater accuracy to aid in emergency situations. The technology will focus on improving geolocation accuracy of mobile devices in rich scattering environments, where current technology suffers significant degradation. In some situations, the location accuracy in these degraded environments results in first responders unable to locate the emergency sufficiently fast, costing lives. The geolocation technology uses the large antenna arrays expected with the onset of 5G and leveraging the attendant rich scattering environments to enhance the location accuracy of current techniques.  This level of geolocation accuracy will lead to many new commercial applications, such as augmented reality and autonomous vehicles.


    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will prove the technical feasibility of the non-line of sight geolocation technology. There are multiple aspects of this project well-grounded theoretically, but requiring demonstration as well as research in algorithms to both improve the performance of the solution and decrease the necessary processing power. The first area of research is RF phenomenology of: 1) the ability to rely on far-field models; and 2) clustered multipath models. The second research area is deconstructing a multipath channel to its individual ray components accurately enough to represent the true electromagnetic reflections, then using that derived information for geolocation. The goal of this project is to advance the technology to proof-of-concept demonstration of both the RF phenomenology and the non-line of sight geolocation algorithms. This will be accomplished through algorithm development in simulation environments and further validated with over-the-air experimentation. It is expected that RF phenomenology models will be refined in this process and fed back into the simulation environment.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to address the high costs associated with building heating and cooling in a sustainable fashion. Heating/cooling constitute approximately 48% of building energy consumption. Ground-source or geothermal heat pumps (GSHPs) represent an energy-efficient and environmentally sustainable heating and cooling solution, but their high upfront capital costs have significantly limited deployment. This project takes a fundamentally different approach to GSHP heat transfer, with the expected result that installation costs are decreased by up to 50% and operating costs by 20% compared to conventional GSHP systems. This project will thoroughly field test and analyze the performance of the GSHP innovation, advancing the technology design and installation parameters, and readying it for commercial deployment.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the problem of the high installation cost and large, disruptive footprint of GSHP systems, with the objective to provide a cost-effective, widely-deployable, renewable solution for building heating and cooling. This project will advance an innovative GSHP field loop technology from numerical and laboratory analyses to manufacturing and field testing. The overall research objective is to determine the performance of the innovative GSHP field loop under real-world conditions. The research program includes: 1) development of a comprehensive numerical model of the innovative GSHP system for field sites; 2) field testing, including final design, installation, and operation of equipment at a field site; 3) numerical model and equipment design refinement following initial field testing; 4) installation and testing of modified equipment; and 5) development of a comprehensive cost, energy use and emissions model. It is anticipated that the project will result in a commercially-ready GSHP product, with design and installation guidelines, that substantially (by up to 50%) reduces the installation cost of GSHPs while improving their performance.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to design and develop a custom processor for performing cryptographic operations. This research will develop algorithms and implement them in hardware to improve their speed. The result of this research will be a design for a cryptographic accelerator that can be manufactured and used by the blockchain industry.  These improvements will accelerate the practicality of blockchain for daily financial use, promoting low-cost open financial networks. These networks can reduce the cost of financial services and enable improved financial inclusion.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to increase the throughput, and reduce the cost, of blockchain consensus protocols. Through the use of a purpose-built cryptographic accelerator it will be possible to make many novel cryptographic techniques practical. These techniques include Verifiable Delay Functions (VDF), RSA Accumulators, and Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge (SNARKs). In particular, this processor will focus on improving the efficiency of generating VDF proofs. VDFs and related cryptographic techniques hold great promise for improving the scalability and security of blockchain protocols, but are currently too slow on standard processors to provide the desired improvements. These techniques will enable the blockchain to be scaled to tens or even hundreds of times its current transaction throughput. Furthermore, these techniques will simultaneously reduce the computational and energy requirements of most modern blockchains dramatically.

    Research (SBIR) project is a breakthrough in long-duration energy storage for
    renewable electricity sources. This project will enable a new rechargeable carbon-oxygen
    battery utilizing ultra-low-cost storage media converting intermittent solar/wind
    power into on-demand power, achieving 100% carbon-free electricity at a cost that
    undercuts conventional fossil fuel generation. Its high energy density, ~3x that
    of lithium ion batteries at the system level, will enable longer range electric
    transportation. Successful development of this technology, enabled by the key
    prototyping steps carried out in this project, will have commercial impact on
    a range of storage applications. Stationary storage end-users include: Off-grid
    (islands, commercial, military) solar-plus-storage; electric utilities and homeowners;
    solar/wind power plant owners and farmers; and data centers requiring low-cost,
    green and more reliable storage. Transportation end-users include: manufacturers

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will be the reduction in home energy costs, electric grid system costs, and environmental impacts from electricity generation. The proposed research project will advance the state of the art in residential combined heating and hot water technology. The research project will resolve the technical risks associated with operating a high-efficiency CO2 heat pump in combined heating and hot water applications, and with implementing efficient load shifting in these applications. The project has the potential to reduce user energy costs, grid system costs, and environmental impacts by: shifting electrical load from peak demand times to off-peak demand times, reducing the need for costly and highly polluting peak power generation resources, and integrating variable renewable energy resources, such as wind and solar at times of low demand. This will put downward pressure on electric rates, as well as provide immediate user bill savings through lower demand and by shifting electricity demand to the cheapest times. The proposed system has the potential for large-scale commercial deployment due to its significantly lower operating costs and lowered initial fixed investments.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to resolve technical challenges associated with the commercial deployment of high-efficiency CO2 heat pumps in combined heating and hot water applications. CO2 heat pumps have demonstrated high efficiency in hot water applications with coefficients of performance up to 5. However, they typically operate much less efficiently in combined systems due to a lack of advanced controls. The research will develop a thermal stratification model of a hot water tank based on customer use and charging conditions, a predictive thermal demand model, and a simulation model of the whole system integrating heat pump performance, tank stratification, and predictive customer demand. The project will then develop new controls (hardware and software) to optimize for user and grid costs and emissions and validate the effectiveness of the resulting control system by integrating it into the existing prototype. This assessment will demonstrate the commercial viability of CO2-based combined heat and hot water systems with load shifting.

- abstractText: "The broader/commercial impact of this project aims to develop and
    commercialize a microfluidic device as a clinical platform to rapidly identify
    precise and effective therapies for individual cancer patients. Currently, prediction
    in precision medicine only has limited success, and the American Society of Clinical
    Oncology (ASCO) does not recommend using any specific drug sensitivity testing
    method alone to guide clinical treatment decision-making. Therefore, there is
    an urgent and unmet clinical need to create a rapidly implementable and clinically
    relevant experimental system that can rapidly and economically test the effects
    of therapeutic options on an individual patient's biopsy. The microfluidic platform
    developed in this project aims to rapidly and accurately evaluate drug efficacy
    using individual patient's biopsies, thus guiding personalized cancer treatment
    and leading to increased survival rates, reduced cost of healthcare, and improved
    quality of patient life. In addition, this technology will facilitate cancer drug
    discovery and development in terms of cost and time, leading to reduced costs
    of drug development. \n\nThis Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase
    I project will develop a microfluidic system that preserves viability, structure,
    and other biological properties of tissue biopsy samples, providing a platform
    for efficient drug screening and determining the responsiveness of individual
    patient cancer samples to therapeutic drugs. Current precision medicine for cancer
    treatment is mainly prediction-based on cancer genomic data instead of direct
    test or validation of the responsiveness of patient cancer samples to drugs. Lack
    of rapid and accurate methods for such direct tests is a major obstacle in cancer
    treatment. To overcome this obstacle, Microfluidic Tissue Arrays (µFTA) will be
    developed to mimic physiological blood perfusion to maintain the native microenvironment
    of tumor samples. As a result, tumor tissues cultured in the µFTAs can preserve
    their in vivo biological properties. This project will establish the feasibility
    of setting up a robust assay in the µFTA for measuring tumor tissue response to
    drugs and assess initial correlation of the obtained data with in vivo results.
    The ultimate goal of this project is to develop a µFTA-based platform to directly
    evaluate the responsiveness of patient biopsy tissues to different therapies,
    thus providing drug selection guidance for individual patients.\n\nThis award

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is that it will significantly lower the initial cost of residential and commercial ground-source heat pump (GSHP) systems, while expanding the existing market through broadening GSHP applicability. This project will demonstrate the feasibility and performance under real-world conditions of a novel in-ground heat exchanger that is both inexpensive and easy to install, even on space-constrained lots, with little landscape disruption.  The technology will lead to increased adoption of energy-efficient heating/ventilation/air conditioning (HVAC) technology, increasing the “electrification” of the energy economy and reducing air polluting emissions. These GSHP systems will impact the national market of heating and cooling systems, with potential annual energy savings of over 6.4 quadrillion BTUs, end-user savings of $77. B in annual energy costs, and reduced peak electricity demand by 144 GW.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to further develop a technology addressing the applicability, desirability and cost-competitiveness of GSHP systems. The chief technical objective of the project is to optimize system components and architectures by increasing fundamental understanding of in-ground heat exchanger performance and installation methods through digital and physical prototyping across a range of real-world conditions.  A second technical objective is to improve fundamental understanding of the energy storage capability of the technology and how it can be leveraged through operational cycling to further increase the performance-cost ratio.  Studies of physical prototyping, installation and thermal properties will be conducted, in addition to computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations.  The primary goals are to demonstrate significant benefits in installed performance-to-cost and an installation time of under 8 hours for a typical residential 3-ton system, compared to the current state-of-the-art of 16 hours.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research project is that it will advance the area of energy sustainability with proactive monitoring and management of carbon emissions in real time. The knowledge of real-time grid carbon data will provide a new perspective for various applications ranging from smart grid controls to future electricity market design.  More broadly, the demonstration of achieving near-optimal carbon emissions reduction without sacrificing economics will provide a commercially viable, scalable path to proactively manage carbon emissions under existing market mechanisms.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will: 1) estimate real-time carbon emissions and analyze grid carbon intensity models from historical data using statistical (offline) learning approaches, 2) design real-time/online optimization and control approaches to reduce carbon emissions while maximizing economic benefits under uncertainties, and 3) develop a proof-of-concept software platform, implement the models and strategies, integrate with hardware, and validate the methods through a pilot. A major theme is to integrate real-time carbon emissions with energy and sustainability management to estimate real-time carbon emissions, develop grid carbon intensity models, leverage real-time data to improve sustainability, and make real-time control decisions under uncertainties of the ambient environment and customer behaviors.

    The broader/commercial impact of this SBIR Phase I project outlines a development plan for a wireless, wearable sensor for noninvasive measurements in shunts in patients with hydrocephalus. Hydrocephalus is a common and costly condition caused by the accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the ventricles of the brain. It affects >1 million people in the US and is nearly always treated with the surgical implantation of a shunt to drain this excess fluid away from the brain. Unfortunately, shunts have extremely high failure rates (98% over ten years) and diagnosing shunt malfunction is confounded by its vague, nonspecific symptoms such as headaches and nausea. Additionally, there exists no direct way to measure flow through shunts. The proposed project would save the US healthcare system >$200 million annually in diagnostic costs and unnecessary hospital admissions. Moreover, it could be used to monitor shunt function at home, providing patients and their caregivers peace of mind. The materials science and mechanical engineering advances required to advance the project will fundamentally advance the development of wearable electronics for digital health.

    The proposed project relies on a set of concepts in materials science, mechanical engineering and fundamental studies of thermal transport phenomena to yield a soft, wireless, wearable device the thermal characterization of skin and soft tissue. Specifically, the integration of controlled, low-power thermal actuators and precise temperature sensors on a flexible circuit on the surface of the skin allows for the mapping of temperature and direction heat flow through near-surface epidermal layers. The flow of heat can be quantitatively correlated to both the presence and magnitude of underlying flow in a range of biological conduits, ranging from shunts to blood vessels. Moreover, the soft, silicone construction of the device presents a nonirritating, compliant interface to the surface of the skin. Quantitative measurements of thermal transport, in comparison to benchtop models and calculations will yield real-time flow rates, while a customized software application on a smartphone, communicating with a Bluetooth system-on-chip located on the device will collect store and analyze data in real-time, proving real-time feedback to physicians, patients and their caregivers.

    The broader/commercial impact of this SBIR Phase I project aims to optimize post-processing techniques of a novel three-dimensional (3D) metal-printed orthodontic system for precise, personalized, and esthetic treatment. Approximately 60% of adults need orthodontic treatment to improve the position and function of their teeth; however, an obstacle to adults seeking orthodontic treatment is the unattractiveness and moderately painful nature of traditional braces. Up to 80% of these patients are not candidates for treatment with clear aligners due to the severity of their malocclusion (improper positioning of teeth). The proposed innovation is a complement to clear aligner therapy that will enable all patients to be treated with an invisible orthodontic appliance, regardless of malocclusion severity. 3D metal printing technology is used to fabricate custom, one-piece, metal attachments with a wire-holding channel that are placed on the back of the teeth and used in conjunction with clear aligners. Successful development of this product and its implementation in dentistry will shift the paradigm of tooth movement towards esthetic and effective personalized treatment with minimum tooth reduction and maximum comfort for millions of patients per year. The technology addresses a $30 billion market.

    The proposed project will optimize 3D metal printing as a high-potential technology for use in human orthodontia devices. Although additive manufacturing fabricates unique 3D structures from metal powder, layer-by-layer deposition results in a ladder structure and high surface roughness. Further, laser sintering could yield enriched chromium carbide grain boundary, which is not desirable, as it may lead to corrosion in the oral environment. Post-processing techniques to prepare 3D metal printed appliances for intraoral use have not yet been established. The funds from this SBIR grant will be used to complete the following aims: 1) Determine a polishing strategy for finishing 3D metal printed surfaces that reduces the surface roughness and creates a passive surface layer that is resistant to corrosion; 2) Evaluate in vitro and in vivo biocompatibility of the 3D metal printed brackets. A variety of polishing methods will be explored, including heat treatment, chemical solutions, and tumbling with an abrasive medium. The results of this research will be impactful to the millions of patients seeking invisible orthodontic treatment each year, as well as to the many manufacturers of medical and dental appliances that are developing custom 3D metal printed devices for better patient outcomes.

    The broader/commercial impact of this SBIR Phase I project will apply Brillouin spectroscopy (an optical method of measuring the speed of sound in a sample) to the early detection of dental caries (cavities). While Brillouin spectroscopy has been used to study other materials, it has not been used before to study caries in the dental enamel. However, initial data and theoretical models suggest that the technology can effectively detect early carious lesions. Once developed, this method will be capable of detecting caries in teeth early enough that remineralization treatments can be effectively used to reverse caries progression, thus sharply reducing the need for drilling, cavity filling, root canals, and implants. Upon widespread commercial adoption, this concept would fundamentally change dental practice, and allow it to focus on prevention instead of intervention. This will improve the patient experience by reducing the need for painful or uncomfortable dental procedures, thereby increasing patient satisfaction and compliance with bi-annual dental exams. The total addressable market for these systems and associated consumables is estimated to be worth nearly $2 billion per year in the United States, and around $5 billion per year worldwide.

    The project proposes Brillouin spectroscopy as a new modality of detecting early caries. The advantage of Brillouin spectroscopy over existing methodology is that it directly detects the enamel softening associated with demineralization in early caries. This patent-pending method is theorized to be more robust to confounding factors such as stains, calculus, and plaques, while maintaining the significant advantages of optical detection: it is non-ionizing, non-damaging, and non-contact, allowing for flexible detection geometry. The overall objective of this proposal is to validate Brillouin spectroscopy as a new, cost-effective, reliable diagnostic method of positively identifying carious lesions at an early stage. To achieve this goal, the project proposes two steps: First, a controlled, in vitro characterization of the sensitivity of Brillouin spectroscopy to early caries will be conducted. The caries will be induced incrementally by a pH-cycling protocol to create physiologically realistic demineralization. Second, the influence of common and potential confounding factors, such as staining, hydration, and incident angle of the light will be assessed. The expectation is that the resulting data will conclusively support the further development of Brillouin spectroscopy for early caries detection.

    The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve the access of people with disabilities to the growing ecosystem of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, thus improving their ability to be independent, connect with others, seek and retain education and employment, and contribute to society both economically and socially. In particular, nearly 20 million US citizens live with disabilities affecting upper limb movement, thus impacting their ability to configure and control devices around the home. This project aims to develop an open platform that allows these consumers customized control of their home devices, using assistive input controls such as adaptive joysticks, sip-and-puff inputs, chin switches, or eye gaze, as well as off-the-shelf consumer input devices such as trackpads or mice.

    The proposed project would advance the consumer Internet of Things (IoT) landscape by enabling end user programmability for IoT applications, giving end users (non-programmers) the ability to modify, control, and automate their devices and services. Our system will draw on a newly patented device control architecture with novel customizability and intuitive access to non-programmers. The use cases supported by the platform would previously have required engineers to spend days or weeks of dedicated time building custom solutions for users; instead, the platform will make these use cases available to non-technical users on a wide scale without requiring custom engineering.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be in protecting natural resources with actionable information on invasive insect pests to be used by local, state and federal agencies to monitor insect pests in real time and plan optimal intervention strategies. Invasive species disproportionately affect vulnerable communities in poor rural areas, especially in developing countries, who depend on natural resources, healthy ecosystems, trade and tourism for their livelihoods. Moreover, invasive insect pests can drive food insecurity and undermine ongoing investments in development. There is a growing consensus that "Early detection and rapid response" is the best solution, but the "Early detection" part of this equation has been lagging for want of robust automatic surveillance systems.

    The proposed project will investigate how to generalize existing machine learning models for insect classification under more general conditions. In particular, existing machine learning models typically make strong assumptions about the "priors" (the prior probably of seeing a given insect) due to the use of very specific attractants. However, to reduce the cost of deployment of insect surveillance, we will investigate the design of pheromone "cocktails" (combination of two or more pheromones) to attract multiple insect species to a single trap. This will require creating new models that do not make such strong assumptions about the insects to be encountered. In addition, the project will investigate novel design principles to create "compromise" traps. For example, if insect A is attracted to the blue color, and insect B is attracted to the red color, is the best color attractant a mixture of the colors (green), or a patchwork work of two colors be arranged as panels, tiles, stripes, etc.? Beyond color, we proposed to investigate the optimal compromises for texture, shape, trap placement, trap orientation etc. Thus, our proposed innovation will lie in producing sensors/physical traps that can simultaneously monitor multiple invasive pests.

    The broader/commercial impact of this SBIR phase I project aims to enable the use of biologics, a newer class of drugs transforming medicine due to its marked effectiveness and specificity, to treat diseases at wet surfaces of the body. Many diseases occur at wet surfaces in the body including the oral cavity, joints, lungs, and gastrointestinal tract. Local application of biologics is currently not used in these areas because the drugs are rapidly washed away before they have any benefit. Biologics are sometimes administered by infusion to treat these diseases, but this has risks of serious, even life-threatening side effects. If biologics could instead be delivered locally, side-effects would be much less of a concern and diseases at wet surfaces could be treated more aggressively and effectively than currently possible. Successful completion of the project will establish proof-of-concept for the technology and create a new platform to treat these diseases to the benefit of patients in ways that were previously impossible. The company will work with pharmaceutical partner companies to utilize their combined resources to commercialize these products and improve health outcomes.

    The central idea is to anchor biologics to wet surfaces so that they act for longer periods (hours or days). Traditional approaches to prolonged drug delivery use some form of problematic carrier; most cannot be used with biologics. The project will validate the technology as a treatment for common dry eye disease, using a mouse model. Antibodies are by far the largest class of biologics, and a procedure has been developed to attach anchors to antibodies while maintaining their activity. The research aims are to validate that: 1) Attaching an anchor prolongs the time an antibody resides on the cornea. The residency time on the corneal surface will be measured using fluorescently labeled antibodies with and without an anchor. 2) An anchored anti-inflammatory antibody is an effective drug to treat dry eye. The effects on the severity of dry eye disease by treating mice with antibodies with and without an anchor will be determined. These aims will test the hypothesis that attaching an anchor to a biologic increases its residency time and its therapeutic efficiency providing proof-of-concept. No other publicly known method of solving the drug washout problem in this manner to treat dry eye disease exists.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project is to develop a green approach to the clean-up and mitigation of uranium-contaminated solutions.  Mining in the Southwest United States has left thousands of legacy sites with uranium-contaminated soils. These soils are polluting adjacent water resources that, in turn, pose serious threats to human and environmental health.  One area alone has over 500 abandoned uranium mining sites, and over 10% of tested water sources exceed national drinking water standards. Uranium is a challenge for modern mining operations as it is often present as a contaminant in mineral processing activities targeting other metals. Uranium must be removed from mining impacted waters to meet social and regulatory obligations, but despite demand from within the mining and environmental industries, a technology both specific to uranium and inexpensive is lacking.  This project will develop solutions to realize uranium remediation at significantly reduced cost.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to innovate green, sugar-based glycolipids that meet several requirements, including:  they selectively bind uranium; they are produced using abundant, inexpensive sugars; and they can be attached to a solid matrix for water remediation packed-bed reactor systems. Currently, synthesis of rhamnolipids is too costly because of the high cost and limited availability of its sugar component, rhamnose. The cost reduction strategy for the new glycolipids will be synthesis with the inexpensive and abundant sugars glucose, xylose, and maltose. To bring these molecules to market as commercial remediation products, the following objectives will be demonstrated: The molecules' selectivity for uranium will be verified, even in the presence of competing metal ions. Viable molecules will then be attached to a solid matrix to demonstrate and characterize uranium sorption in simple solutions. Lastly, real-world uranium-contaminated solutions from active and legacy mining sites will be tested to validate the solution. Success of the glycolipid sorbents will be gauged by their ability to remediate solutions to regulatory standards.

    The broader/commercial impact of this SBIR Phase I project addresses the important unmet clinical need of enabling interventional radiologists to prevent pneumothorax (collapsed lung) during transthoracic lung biopsies. Annually, over 1.2 million transthoracic lung biopsies are performed worldwide for lung cancer diagnosis (400,000 in the US). Pneumothorax (PTX), a collapsed lung, is the most common complication of this procedure, occurring in 20-40% of all transthoracic lung biopsies. More than half of PTX turn symptomatic and require an invasive chest tube insertion, the definitive treatment for PTX. This complication costs, on an average, $15,000 per chest tube insertion and $1.3 billion worldwide to treat. This turns a same-day diagnostic procedure into a costly multi-day hospitalization.

    The research objectives of the proposed project are to evaluate and demonstrate the feasibility of using a biopolymer sealant and novel access/delivery device to seal needle tracts to prevent PTX during transthoracic lung biopsies. Further, in-vitro and in-vivo preliminary biocompatibility of the material as well as efficacy of the delivery device as compared to the current standard of care will be investigated.

    Innovation Research (SBIR) project is the ability to control zebra & quagga mussel

    substantial ecological impacts. Currently, there is no treatment option available

    known mechanism of action, limited half-life, no expected long-term environmental
    impact, and limited to absent off-target impact. This work is believed to be novel
    as biopesticides utilizing immunotoxin technology for the remediation of aquatic
    nuisance species are not well developed.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will enhance both public safety and public health by addressing two problems:   1) Approximately 3,500 letters containing white powders and over 5,500 explosive threats are received by private and public offices each year; these may be hoaxes that result in temporary shut-down and lost productivity; or more critically, they may contain anthrax, ricin, fentanyl, or an explosive device.   2) The opioid epidemic is fueled by international delivery of powders contained in small packets, pills, or liquid formulations; all require to non-invasive detection.  This project will develop novel image processing techniques utilizing terahertz imaging to detect harmful items concealed within letters and packages.  If successful, terahertz scanners powered by these image analysis algorithms may become as ubiquitous as copiers, printers, and document scanners in any corporate office, addressing critical public health and safety challenges.

    The proposed project will develop image processing and computer vision techniques to capitalize on the multidimensional, dynamic 3-D terahertz imaging dataset captured via desktop-based terahertz scanners.  No commercially-viable approaches exist, capable of automatically detecting threats in real-time from terahertz imaging data streams for security applications.  This project aims to develop robust techniques to both enhance the capabilities of a human operator and automatically detect specific threats.  One non-trivial challenge is the detection of liquid/particle motion within the context of a moving reference frame - such as the motion of liquid within a small pouch, itself concealed within a moving package.  The terahertz imaging system is capable of detecting single drops of liquid (50 mg) and imaging the movement of powders within explosives in real-time.  Another focus area for the project will be the integration of the 3-D terahertz data set together with contextual information gleaned from other sensor inputs, as well as external sources due to the connected nature of the device (internet of things).  The fusion of this information with the terahertz data will provide unparalleled detection capabilities and have far reaching impacts in the field of dynamic, 3-D imaging, well beyond threat detection.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be the introduction of a revolutionary new technology for electrical components affected by electrical noise, electromagnetic interference, large footprint, and high bill of materials costs associated with certain components.  This will have a major impact for noise-sensitive circuits in demanding military, medical and communication applications. The dramatically reduced footprint and component count will enable smaller, lighter and lower-cost electronic circuits, positively impacting a wide range of technologies, such as portable consumer electronics and Internet-of-Things devices. The unique innovation developed in the project will enable integrated circuits with improved performance at lower heating and higher system efficiencies. This novel technology can be manufactured with existing processes, enabling high volume, reliable and low-cost commercial components.

    The proposed project will create the first demonstration of a voltage regulator circuit able to provide efficient voltage up-conversion and down-conversion without switching. The technology uses photons to multiply or divide voltage within a novel voltage regulator architecture. The research will address the main technical challenges to achieving high efficiency, including photon generation, photon transfer and conversion to electricity within optoelectronic devices. Minimizing optical and electrical losses is crucial to achieving a high efficiency voltage regulator circuit, critical to many DC-DC conversion applications. The research will study non-radiative losses in semiconductor light emitters, photon management strategies to reduce optical loss, and electrical device design to minimize carrier collection and series resistance losses. Finally, these aspects will be combined into a fully functional voltage regulator circuit, aiming to demonstrate purely DC voltage up-conversion with efficiencies as high as 85%. To accomplish this, the project uses advanced optoelectronic device design and modeling, commercial epitaxy, advanced compound semiconductor fabrication, semiconductor material and device characterization, and analog circuit modeling and development.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to reduce cost and accelerate development of
    high-performance electronic devices.  The electronics industry is a major growth
    engine with enormous impact that includes health (e.g., medical devices), education
    (e.g. computers, internet), and cleaner energy and environment (e.g., LEDs, photovoltaics).
    Innovation in semiconductor device design and fabrication continue to foster faster
    processing speeds and larger storage capacities. However, continuing on this path
    requires improved metrology techniques and tools providing in-depth information
    about materials employed in device structures, so that the ever increasing development
    cost of advanced devices can be controlled. The proposed work will demonstrate
    a new electrical characterization method with the potential to reduce this cost
    and accelerate development of semiconductors for important applications such as
    artificial intelligence, computing, communications, transportation and energy.
    \n\nThe proposed project targets development of a novel electrical characterization
    technique and tool to make measurements on three-dimensional (3D) semiconductor
    structures. Many advanced electronic devices employ semiconductor layers in the
    shape of 3D structures, such as fins, and there is an urgent need to develop metrology
    approaches to fully characterize such structures. The proposed innovation will
    generate resistivity depth profiles through 3D structures in a conformal manner.
    The goal is to achieve a depth resolution of at least 1 nm and develop a good
    understanding of dopant activation in such structures. A piece of hardware will
    be developed to apply the technique to samples comprising a sea of 3D features
    to demonstrate the concept and feasibility of the proposed processes.\n\nThis

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop tools that will create vast amounts of water quality data for the nation's inland, fresh waters. The data allow for direct environmental monitoring and for validation of other remote sensing GIS techniques to measure inland water quality. Algorithms will also be developed to use the data to allow anglers to customize their selection of lures based on the time and location where they are fishing. The difficulty for the angler is anticipating which lures are most visible to the fish, because fish see differently than humans. This project develops software tools and water quality sensors that allow anglers to customize their fishing strategies for any type of water. The product will ultimately recommend lures that work well for a given location based on the properties of the water, the properties of the lures, and the visual capabilities of fish in that environment.

    The proposed project will measure the optical properties of (a) lakes and rivers. First-generation photometers would be constructed to estimate the sub-surface transmission and light-levels at three wavelengths and capture relevant water quality data. The project also proposes new methods to accommodate the selection of fluorescent pigments on lures. Algorithms will use the data to estimate the visual contrasts as perceived by certain species of fish and determine which lures have the highest probability of success for that species - bass in the first instance. The novelty of this approach is that it relies on estimating critical lighting parameters at three wavelength bands. Traditional methods rely on spectrometers that estimate spectra with thousands of data points and are not feasible for anglers. This project directly tests whether 3 well-spaced data points can accurately estimate lighting environments, visual signals, and their transmission in diverse water bodies.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project involves a low-cost, convenient, anonymous floor occupancy analysis. This will be achieved by developing a powerless, flexible subfloor sensor mat that can integrate with regular flooring products. If implemented in buildings, the sensor mat will help raise space utilization, improve occupant productivity and satisfaction, and inform dynamic layout planning for organizational agility. This sensor mat will address the needs from different parties in the small building ecosystem, including flooring manufacturers, building system integrators, work space system providers, architects and interior designers, and cooperations and businesses in commercial buildings. Additionally, this thin film with high electrical output, if successfully achieved in this project, will find great commercialization potential in other applications, such as self-powered, wireless adhesive wearable electronics, and implantable medical devices. This proposal also has an environmental impact in that it reduces carbon footprint, promotes use of green natural materials and generation of renewable energy.

    The proposed project has the intellectual merits of addressing two key questions that could determine the technical and commercial feasibility of the occupancy sensor mat.  First, how to create a sufficiently thin and flexible sensor mat that has no impact on flooring installment and walking performance. Second, how to raise the electrical output and energy generated from the sensor mat to the level that is high enough to meet the requirements of signal resolution and wireless transmission? Specific research tasks and methods include: natural cellulosic materials chemical functionalization for electric property engineering towards high power output; sensor mat design to effectively convert footsteps to electricity within a confined mat thickness; integration of wireless transmission units tailored for the sensor mat towards a self-powered sensor with wireless connectivity. The final goal is to develop a powerless sensor from which the electrical output and the energy generation will be sufficient to sustain itself and to provide discernible data.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to reduce two stroke emissions while improving overall engine efficiencies. Engine emissions directly impact the environment, wildlife, and public health. Small engines used in powersports and small lightweight ground transportation are becoming a significant source of emissions. The technology developed in this effort will yield a low cost high power density engine with reduced emissions output. Transportation manufactures have limited low cost options to improve emissions and this technology will provide a commercial incentive to implement; keeping cost low while achieving lower emissions outputs.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to develop two stroke engine technology that reduces engine emissions. Two stoke engines are low cost with high power density but despite these advantages, the two stroke engines' major disadvantage is the emissions produced by the engine. The disadvantages are inherent to the design of the traditional two stroke engine with the lubrication oil being mixed with the fuel and the port design allowing unburnt hydrocarbons to exit the engine. This project will address these shortcomings of the traditional two stoke developing an engine with an emissions profile similar to that of a four stoke engine.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) project is the development of safe and effective, toxin-free biocontrol
    of insects and other invasive organisms. Mosquitoes and other insects cost upwards
    of $10 B/year to the world economy due to their impact on human health and revenue
    losses to agriculture. Current control measures available are neither effective,
    environmentally friendly, scalable for widespread application, nor cost effective
    to implement. This project aims to address the above deficiencies. The goal is
    to develop insect control methods that are effective, have minimal environmental
    impact and are cost effective to implement and hence attractive to commercialization.
    \n\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a genetically modified sterile
    male accelerated release technique (SMART) for Aedes aegypti mosquito control.
    The innovative development of SMART mosquitoes solves several issues in mosquito
    control, including: sorting of males and females, transportation of adult males,
    laborious release processes, and non-scalable operation. The SMART approach requires
    eggs that can be produced at a centralized facility, stored at room temperature
    until needed, and inexpensively shipped at room temperature in a small container.
    Customers need only add water with supplied nutrients to hatch the eggs, from
    which only males emerge that amplify male sterility by producing sterile males
    with each reproduction cycle. The scope of the research proposal is limited to
    creating synthetic genetic incompatibility in mosquitoes by targeting germline
    male sterility. The key technical objectives are to: 1) optimize components of
    programmable transcriptional activators in mosquitoes and 2) engineer synthetic
    genetic incompatibility into germline of Ae. aegypti. The anticipated outcome
    of this project will be state-of-the-art SMART mosquitos that are effective at
    biocontrol that is scalable and economical to implement.\n\nThis award reflects

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project includes both societal and economic benefits. Upon successful completion, the project will introduce a new type of radiation protection monitor or dosimeter that would be worn by individuals that are potentially exposed to ionizing radiation (like x-rays). Typically, this includes health care workers, nuclear energy workers, soldiers, and first responders. This new dosimeter measures human exposure more accurately because it reacts to radiation the same way that human tissue responds. This is referred to as tissue equivalence, and it represents breakthrough technology in radiation monitoring. The promise of tissue equivalent detection at an affordable price allows for improved and efficient dose management for radiation workers, safer medical procedures, broader acceptance of atomic energy sources, novel screening and efficient monitoring for the military, and better situational awareness for first responders. Additionally, the new dosimeters, called Solid State Tissue Equivalent detectors or SSTEDs, are made from completely organic materials using more modern fabrication techniques. Overall, this reduces the cost per unit of a typical dosimeter. From an economic standpoint, the introduction of SSTEDs will create jobs in a new technology sector while decreasing the cost of radiation monitoring.

    This proposed project will optimize the design of the current Solid State Tissue Equivalent Detector (SSTED) configuration to overcome the one remaining significant technical challenge. Organic semiconductor devices respond well to ionizing radiation. Unfortunately, the physical bond that joins a device's active region to its biasing electronics also may respond to radiation. The response of organic semiconductor devices to ionizing radiation is tissue equivalent because the semiconductor has an equivalent radiation cross section to that of tissue. The bond is not organic, and therefore does not respond with a tissue equivalent response. The project will determine whether design parameters within the organic device itself can be adjusted to mask the bond response. To accomplish this, devices with varying active region thicknesses and geometries will be fabricated and entire devices and their associated supporting electronics and bond regions will be probed with a narrow radiation beam to characterize the contribution to the response of each sub-region within the device and supporting structures. This will answer the question "can a set of design parameters be optimized that will remove bond response from the radiation measurement?" determining whether a compensating design scheme that cancels out the bond response must be employed.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is the introduction of urban farming as a viable new industry for small businesses by driving down the barrier of entry to hydroponic farming. Conventional hydroponic farming necessitates complex systems in which a variety of variables must be monitored and controlled by a skilled operator in response to changes throughout the plant lifecycle and care must be taken to control these variables precisely. This need for demanding management by a technically-educated farmer has restricted the widespread adoption of urban hydroponic farming. This project will result in a fully-automated precision farming platform managing the full scope of urban farming operations. The platform uses trends in a hydroponic grown zone to forecast changes to system variables and crop growth and to automatically and intelligently adjust vital parameters to optimize resource usage and maximize output. Because the precision doser will not require extensive agricultural expertise, it will make hydroponic farming accessible to small-scale farmers, restaurateurs, and private consumers. Once it becomes possible for non-industrial operations to establish hydroponics, urban farms can place sources of fresh, organic produce right in the heart of food deserts without reliance on GMOs, herbicides, or pesticides.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a hydroponics farming control platform which intelligently predicts crop growth, forecasts vital system variables including the pH and electrical conductivity, and tunes environmental parameters in accordance with the forecasts, precisely adjusting the growing zone to maximize crop output while minimizing wasted resources. More than one-tenth of households in the United States cope without adequate nutrition or rely on processed foods, leading to the dual crisis of food insecurity and obesity throughout urban environments. Because they do not have the same extensive land and water requirements as traditional farming, hydroponic operations can take root in urban environments where access to fresh, nutritious produce is restricted. This project will target two aspects of hydroponic agriculture essential to the development of a precision farming tool: crop output and system parameters. By analyzing trends in plant growth, the platform will inform decision-making around resource usage, allowing the grower to adjust system parameters that promote the most successful crops. The final platform will directly address the concern of food deserts in urban localities, by offering a means to grow fresh produce locally, reducing the production costs of standard farming operations, and optimizing crop output in hydroponic systems.

    in their pocket through the proposed product. Through use of mobile devices, a
    $100 tablet can replace thousands of dollars in laboratory equipment. Everything
    the student needs to complete their studies will be included in the app or through
    in-app purchases. Teacher training would be minimal because back-end validation
    of all reagent kits and accompanying gear is completed to make its use seamless
    and universally applicable. All accompanying information required for the teacher
    is provided including in-App assessment tools of student performance. The app
    may be downloaded by anyone in the country and gear/reagents rapidly shipped directly

    laboratory skills and concepts via discovery-based learning. The app includes
    an exploration lab module that simulates high-end scientific equipment, including

    who are poised to prosper in the workforce of the future. \n\n\nCollaborative
    AR must surmount technical hurdles in image recognition, integration and pedagogy
    to achieve acceptance in elementary education. Capabilities of existing AR technologies
    suffer shortcomings in the functionality required for real-time recognition of
    three-dimensional space with common devices, including issues with the camera,
    image projection, and processing. Technical innovations are required for new methods
    to identify and place targets within the uniformity of learning environments.
    The additional challenge of implementing live collaboration in a multi-user setting
    requires technical innovations around the seamless integration of various devices
    as well as the development and testing of intuitive user interfaces from both
    student and instructor perspectives. These include how to measure behaviors, handle
    conflicting actions, and how to give, receive and respond to the dynamic instructor
    feedback. Understanding, measuring and reporting the educational advantages and
    shortcomings in motivating and developing diverse learners in distinct learning
    environments cannot be overlooked in implementing technology tools. Meaningful
    pedagogical innovations must occur to effectively leverage the new power of AR
    without overlooking unintended impacts on students or their educational outcomes.
    These specifications require novel curriculum design both to achieve the cross-disciplinary
    understanding through increasingly complex problems and to deliver the full impact
    promised by educational AR.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to replace existing time-consuming numerical tools and inaccurate statistical and analytical methods in unconventional oil and gas field development design with more accurate hybrid models that take advantage of physical properties as well as advanced machine learning methods. The initial tests suggest that such AI software can significantly increase the prediction accuracy and reduce the cost per barrel of produced oil and gas. The results of this research enable oil and gas producers to increase their ultimate oil recovery from their unconventional reservoirs (also known as shale reservoir) by exploring all possible well and completion designs and finding the most optimal one based on multiple criteria.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to develop an intelligent decision support system (IDSS) to optimize unconventional oil and gas field development designs. It is for the first time that a comprehensive IDSS is being proposed in the oil and gas industry for this purpose. The technology behind this software improves the field development design process at three levels. First, a robust predictive model using a hybrid approach (physics-based reservoir engineering, advanced machine learning, and deep learning) makes an accurate and fast production forecast for every potential design. Then, at the optimization level, considering the local subsurface geological uncertainty, the model finds the most optimum field development designs. Eventually, at the highest level, the cognitive unit helps decision makers to find their final design based on their objectives.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to decrease the number of overweight trucks on the roads by developing a financially and technically practical screening tool to detect overweight vehicles on most roads in real-time. Overweight commercial vehicles are a significant cause of the nation's crumbling roads and bridges besides being a prime threat to transportation safety.

    The proposed project addresses the issue of effectively detecting overweight trucks on roads using real-time video-images while neither interfering with the traffic flow nor integrity the pavement. The proprietary system, WeighCam system, includes proprietary electro-optical system, algorithms, and system design. It will be easy to operate and robust in the sense that it will reliably work in most ambient environmental conditions such as ambient luminosity changes, etc. The purpose of this research will be to validate the basics of the system and calibrate the measurements using known weights to deduce the system limitations and to establish the feature sets of the Minimum Viable Product (MVP), a necessary step to start the manufacture of a commercial prototype. The final prototype will be a practical, autonomous, quick to install, and continuously operating continuous system sending data in real time.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to drive down healthcare costs by enabling access to data through blockchain technology. The healthcare system is plagued by inefficiencies, many of which boil down to the inability to access the right data at the right time because of technological and business barriers. Leveraging blockchain for data access can drive an identified $100 billion in savings. However, while an estimated 40% of senior finance executives expect their firm to invest in blockchain over the next 2 years because of its transformational qualities, the transaction speed of blockchain needs to be improved. This project addresses this need, bringing a critical scaling innovation to Health Nexus - the open source, HIPAA-compatible blockchain.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to address several technical hurdles that will lead to successful commercialization. The project will deploy novel Graphene protocol for efficient propagation of completed transactions across the Health Nexus network. Graphene is a recent breakthrough in block propagation technology that requires a small fraction of network costs compared to existing technology, promising to improve performance of Health Nexus while lowering its costs. The project's research and development will seek to deploy Graphene on Health Nexus and quantify its performance in practice. Additional goals include designing and deploying fast methods for encoding blocks and selecting protocol parameters, methods for managing variation in the level of transaction synchronization among peers, and robust methods of recovery from failure. Early consensus identifies opportunity in supply chain management, drug distribution, and claims processing and billing, but there are innumerable amount of potential applications of blockchain in healthcare that cannot be predicted now - just as it would have been impossible to predict smartphones in early Internet days. The economic impact of bringing down healthcare cost has the potential to benefit millions of lives in ways we cannot imagine. This infrastructure is crucial as the foundation of blockchain innovation.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will revolutionize the way older adults who live independently at home are monitored. According to the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), nearly 90% of older adults (age 65 and above) prefer to stay independently at their homes, coining the term "ageing in place". The proposed monitoring system monitors older adults in real time for changes in physical activity, falls, and loss of balance. These parameters can indicate changes in frailness in older adults which if addressed early can extend their period of independent living. The system will monitor blood pressure, heart rate, heart rate variability, and common cardiac conditions that often accompany loss of balance or falls, which can trigger early and more informed intervention that will allow issues to be addressed before a more serious injury occurs due to a fall. Current industry solutions rely on reactively initiating assistance after a fall is detected, which are usually too late to reverse the age-related deterioration and are ineffective at extending independent living. Ability of living independently longer for older adults will translate into significant savings in cost of care and will also improve their wellbeing.

    The proposed project will develop an end-to-end monitoring systems for older adults living independently at home consisting of: 1) Development of a small wearable device for measurement of Heart Rate, Pulse Oximetry, Blood Pressure, and ECG; 2) Development of activity monitoring system and classification of activities that can be used in tracking frailty of a monitored older adult. Changes in frailty can be observed remotely, allowing for early intervention and potentially the ability to reverse physical or mental degradation. In addition, the system can assist in the decision when the older adults need a full-time caregiver to remain at home, which is difficult and usually preceded by some serious accident or medical emergency, such as a fall resulting in hospitalization or a serious illness. Such delayed decision can have serious life-threatening consequences.  The advancements will be made in activity monitoring, non-invasive continuous blood pressure monitoring to track changes in blood pressure, and integration of anomaly detection into ECG waveform analysis to provide additional information when loss of balance or fall occurs. Such real time monitoring will tax the battery of the wearable device and will be addressed by exploring anomaly-based energy management to prolong battery life.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will provide a low-cost wearable Internet-of-Things (IoT) device for upper extremity physical therapy rehabilitation. The project will contribute to the ultimate goal of helping patients suffering from stroke or joint-related injuries of the upper extremities. The project will result in a body of knowledge that physicians can leverage. For example, Fugl-Meyer assessment (FMA) scores can be computed from the acquired sensorimotor information to assess the physical performance of a patient. Our innovative body area sensor network with smart glove base station (BASN-SG) design can be used to track and speed up the patient recovery process by promoting neuroplasticity through biofeedback. Thus, providing both the physician and patient a quantitative tool for upper extremity rehabilitation. Outreach opportunities will be pursued through local middle schools to use this BASN-SG technology to generate student interest in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) topics. The project also has a huge commercial impact and has a potential to lower the health care and labor cost associated with neurological rehabilitation of stroke patients by over 30%.

    The proposed project aims to develop and commercialize a novel BASN-SG design that leverages an award winning and patent pending IoT smart glove device to measure the sensorimotor information of the human hand, which is not possible through alternative means, e.g., smart phone. Furthermore, the smart glove will be exploited for secure centralized processing of the sensitive biokinetic and physiological information that will be wirelessly transmitted from the BASN. Conducting sensor data fusion and processing closer to the body will address issues associated with signal propagation and multipath, packet loss due to signal interference and noise, cyber threats due to network attacks to foster physician-patient confidentiality, and energy consumption of wireless sensor nodes. Our research objectives includes: (1) developing a wearable exercise shirt with built-in modular wireless sensor nodes for acquiring the bio-states of the user to be transmitted to the smart glove base station, (2) algorithms on the smart glove to enable conducting sensor data fusion and processing closer to the human body, and (3) a virtual reality software tool that uses the aggregated and fused data set from the smart glove base station as an input controller for user biofeedback.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will stem from the advancement of material processing techniques for carbon-containing (organic) materials. Carbon is ubiquitous on Earth and conveys to materials made from it a variety of strategic and technical advantages. Advances in chemistry and materials science are increasing the utility of organic materials in the semiconductor industry. This is enabling organic materials to replace rare metals which can be ecologically damaging to mine or must be sourced from politically sensitive parts of the world. The $100 Billion display industry is leading this revolution with the commercialization of the organic light emitting diode (OLED). Critical weaknesses make the manufacturing of OLEDs extremely expensive, especially for large displays. The result is an industry-wide effort to move away from conventional semiconductor manufacturing techniques and to printing. Printed OLED displays are substantially less expensive but are 50% less power efficient. As a result, they are not suitable for devices reliant on battery power. This limits their commercial potential to less than 25% of the total display market.

    The proposed project will leverage recent discoveries in the properties of organic materials to develop a new processing technique for printed OLEDs. Incumbent OLED manufacturing technology orients the light emitting component of the device in a way which maximizes power efficiency. This is not currently possible in printed displays. We will develop new methods of depositing thin films of OLED materials to create oriented emitters. Based on the results of experiments, we will gain knowledge of the fundamental mechanism which enables molecular orientation in solution deposited thin films. We will use this mechanism to demonstrate that our processing technique is compatible with the display printing supply chain and facilitate future integration of our technology into OLED printers.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be in the railroad, civil infrastructure, and engineering services industries, by providing engineering firms and infrastructure owners the means to enhance public safety while significantly reducing the costs of bridge infrastructure monitoring and revenue losses due to infrastructure downtime due to sudden events. Thousands of sudden events, such as vehicle impacts and overweight vehicle crossings, occur annually on the over 700,000 bridges in the U.S. Many go unnoticed or unreported, despite their potential to induce structural failures or hidden damage that significantly reduces the structure's service life. This project will provide a cost-effective wireless solution to detect, quantify, and report sudden events on civil infrastructure in near real-time. The proposed solution will replace three existing types of monitoring systems with one compact, easy-to-deploy device at a fraction of the cost of even a single legacy system. The rapid condition assessment capability will further reduce traffic disruption, thereby lowering daily economic losses that can range in the millions of dollars and offering the potential to make the nation's transportation infrastructure safer.

    The proposed project seeks to develop a smart IoT monitoring system for rapid condition assessment of civil infrastructure under sudden events. Wired systems are prohibitively expensive for most structures, particularly bridges in remote locations, and existing wireless solutions following a duty-cycle approach to reduce power draw are incapable of always-on monitoring needed for sudden event detection. The objective of the research is to develop a low-cost IoT system to maintain always-on monitoring, so as not to miss an event, under a minimal power budget, without sacrificing data fidelity, and with a very low false positive rate. To this end, an asynchronously-triggered, synchronized data acquisition method will be developed, using high-fidelity wireless sensors that are tightly coupled with a programmable event-based switch capable of always-on operation. This method would enable the system to maintain ultralow-power operation indefinitely, and upon event detection, to rapidly transition to high-fidelity measurement. Uniquely, the pre- and post-event data are processed and stitched together across multiple sensors without the need for a priori synchronization. Experiments will be conducted to demonstrate the system?s capabilities to capture the onset of sudden events and present structural damage assessment in near real-time.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project results from the ability to design a reusable nanofiltration membrane platform for wastewater treatment. Energy-efficient and effective wastewater treatment for water purification and reuse remains a tremendous challenge because safe and reliable approaches are often capital and energy intensive. The production of clean water from wastewater for municipal or industrial reuse requires the removal of a wide range of organic and inorganic contaminants, including many hazardous and toxic substances (e.g., pesticides, heavy metals, pharmaceuticals, etc.). Energy costs are driven even higher by the high fouling propensity of polymeric membranes with the wide array of water contaminants.  Preventing fouling and enabling high contaminant rejection with low energy requirements remain the two core challenges of membrane filtration for wastewater treatment. The proposed technology will address the two core challenges through the use of an anti-fouling surface chemistry. The low energy requirements, contaminant rejection, and anti-fouling properties of the proposed membrane make it a disruptive innovation that can easily penetrate the market, providing a cost-effective solution that is lacking in current membrane purification systems.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a nanofiltration technology utilizing surface chemistry modification for the creation of an anti-fouling membrane for the rejection of pesticides.  The United States spends nearly $9 billion a year on pesticides, which account for 16% of the world pesticide market. Out of the 25 most common active ingredients in pesticides, 76% are water soluble, which leads to contaminated soil, groundwater, and nearby bodies of water. The objectives of this project are to remove common commercial pesticides from water while investigating the advantageous effects of an anti-fouling membrane surface. Performance of the membrane will be investigated through cross flow filtration experiments to identify rejection, stability, and anti-fouling properties. The vision is to create a nanofiltration membrane  with a broad contaminant rejection while decreasing energy requirements and fouling.

    program useful for underserved high school students to grow their knowledge, skills,
    and disposition in data science and statistics, and to prepare them for college
    and careers in STEM related fields. This project addresses the serious shortcomings
    in the quality, and hence engagement and effectiveness of most of educational
    games in use today. Above all this project seeks to prevent American students
    from falling further behind in STEM education and losing access to the expanding
    technology and data science economy of the next several decades, where strategic
    sectors of our public life are affected, including scientific research, technology,
    engineering, medicine, finance, and artificial intelligence. The progress of science
    and the prosperity of this nation require U.S. citizens, in line with the statutory
    mission of the NSF, to find solutions to this shortage of human resources in data
    science. This project seeks to capitalize on the engineering and design superiority
    of this country's video game industry to recapture and retain global leadership
    in statistics and data science research and education. The full build of the learning
    game and the underlying platform is expected to generate jobs and the high amount
    of tax revenue annually. \n\n\nThis project develops the core video game client
    and server infrastructure using a hub and spoke paradigm, which maximizes efficiency
    across the entire creation of the game. Future games will be built upon this established
    core skeleton of systems, whereby only a fraction of content will need to be generated
    to produce a new game. The immersive 3D digital game of this project would be
    comparable to modern industry standards. With the principle of statistical inference,
    instead of asking the student to apply formulas and data that a teacher provides,
    the game activities will engage the student in the creation of statistical formulas,
    raw data and analysis on their own game data. The goals of this study are to establish
    technical feasibility and usability of the game and gather preliminary evidence
    of effectiveness of the game intervention on student performance and interest
    in statistic employing a mixed methods research design with iterative end-user
    testing trials. The impact of the game intervention will be compared with that
    of the traditional learning in statistics. During the intervention, summative
    and formative assessments and fidelity of implementation study will be conducted.
    Student, teacher, and expert feedback and observation findings will be used to
    develop the video game.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology
    Transfer (STTR) project is to demonstrate feasibility and determine the capacity
    of an innovative advanced, high-rate wet weather treatment technology to cost-effectively
    protect environmental and public health during high-intensity rain events by eliminating
    sewer overflows and basement back-ups. The wastewater utility industry has demonstrated
    a great unmet need for reliable, cost-effective, end-of-pipe wet weather treatment
    as an alternative to expensive long-term plans that emphasize large capital projects.
    The innovative approach being scaled and optimized during this project seeks to
    achieve the same or higher level of treatment in 35 minutes as conventional wastewater
    treatment achieves in 10-14 hours. A lower treatment time means a smaller system
    footprint and, ultimately, cost savings for the utility and ratepayers. The technology
    will address customer needs by identifying potential sewer overflow \"hotspots\"
    that act as \"drains\" in the utility sewershed during storm events. Each drain
    solution would alleviate overburdened collection, conveyance, and treatment systems
    by treating wet weather flows and safely releasing them into waterways. This innovative
    technology can also be applied at a water reclamation facility to handle overburden
    or as a mobile unit during disaster relief efforts.  \n\nThis STTR Phase I project
    proposes the evaluation of novel concepts including the application of advanced
    oxidation processes (AOPs) for wet weather treatment, the combination of rapid
    solid removal technologies with AOPs, and the use of a sustainable waste material
    as a catalyst for enhanced hydroxyl radical production in catalytic ozonation.
    None of the above aspects have been commercially implemented. The work proposed
    will demonstrate the ability for advanced technologies to be cost-effectively
    applied for wet weather treatment, disrupting the standard of partial combined
    sewer overflow treatment by providing a viable option for rapid wet weather treatment
    that meets or exceeds Clean Water Act discharge standards. These concepts will
    be applied at a pilot scale treating real wastewater to determine the technical
    and chemical scaling factors for commercial feasibility. Metrics for success within
    the research plan include aggressive conventional contaminant removal goals, increased
    flowrate for overall decreased treatment time and footprint, and a targeted cost
    ($/gallon treated) analysis to ensure competitive edge in the market. It is expected
    that the results will further demonstrate the importance of solids removal ahead
    of AOPs, and the implementation of catalytic ozonation will demonstrate increased
    efficacy and flexibility as the technology scales.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's
    statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
    the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase I project aims to focus on the challenges neuroradiologists
    and neurosurgeons experience when visualizing complex brain aneurysms. Brain aneurysms,
    which occur in 2-3% of the population, are balloon-like dilations of a blood vessel
    supplying the brain which may rupture and result in severe headaches, paralysis,
    coma and death. Currently, radiologists viewing Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
    scans use a 'slice-by-slice' approach to diagnose brain aneurysms and unfortunately
    with this approach, nearly one in ten brain aneurysms will be missed. Technologies
    that enhance perceptual interpretation of images will increase diagnostic accuracy.
    This NSF project aims to create a physiologically accurate 3D cognitive experience
    for the radiologist with the goal of increasing diagnostic accuracy of brain aneurysms.
    The broader significance is the application to other areas of medicine including
    heart imaging, cancer imaging and trauma, which account for the #1, #2 and #3
    most common causes of death in the U.S. The proposed research is rooted in a small
    US based company and meets the NSF?s mission to advance the national health, prosperity,
    and welfare. The accurate 3D cognitive experience developed for medicine meets
    NSF?s mission of progress of science, but has potential commercial impact in engineering,
    industry and education. \n\n\nThis NSF project aims to create a physiologically
    accurate 3D cognitive experience for the neuroradiologist and neurosurgeon wherein
    the user can view exactly the structures of interest unhindered by other overlying
    tissues. This project aims to overcome the significant limitations of current
    imaging techniques. A typical magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) exam includes
    hundreds of cross-sectional slices. Conventional slice-by-slice viewing is arduous
    because the viewer has to sift through a series of image slices to mentally reconstruct
    the volumetric information relevant for detecting abnormalities. Volume rendering
    of a 3D image on 2D monitors is significantly limited due to overlap of structures
    in the foreground causing suboptimal visualization of deeper structures. Furthermore,
    volume rendering on 2D monitors does not actually recapitulate the physiologic
    eye-brain capture of a 3D image. The goal of this project is to achieve higher
    sensitivity, higher specificity and improved morphologic analysis using a physiologically
    accurate 3D cognitive experience compared to conventional viewing methods. Volunteer
    neuroradiology fellow participants will review MRA examinations using conventional
    methods and the physiologically accurate 3D experience developed in this NSF grant.
    Key outcomes of this project including diagnostic accuracy, time-to-detection,
    aneurysm conspicuity and aneurysm morphology will be assessed using the two techniques.\n\nThis
    award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
    evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review

    Research (SBIR) project will be to develop an affordable, easy-to-use, novel feed
    additive formulation for dairy cows that will result in reduced enteric methane
    production while providing financial benefits for producers. Methane is the second
    largest contributor to greenhouse gases and the raising of ruminant animals is
    a significant source. Methane is not only burdensome to the environment, it is
    also wasteful to the dairy industry because its formation in animal digestive
    systems creates a 10% loss in potential energy for meat, milk, leather, or animal
    labor. As such, there is growing desire from consumers, advocates, and the dairy
    industry to produce a more environmentally friendly product. Preliminary results
    of incorporating this novel feed additive formulation point towards an additional
    $20 of income per head from the increase in feed efficiency, along with a 50%
    decrease in enteric methane formation. \n\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes
    to develop a novel probiotic that, when paired with nitrate, will reduce enteric
    methane emissions in dairy cows. The research plan will include four successive
    28-day periods, with 21 days for diet adaptation and seven days for data and sample
    collection, to assess the effects of a nitrate and P. fortis formulation. The
    experiment will consist of a replicated 4 x 4 Latin square design. Eight ruminally-cannulated,
    mid-lactation multiparous Holstein cows will be assigned to one of two Latin squares
    and fed each of four diets over the four periods. After completion of this study,
    a more precise cost-benefit analysis will be performed with the resulting data,
    which will include milk yields, nitrogen balance, metabolic data, and methane
    outputs. In addition, the plan is to examine the rumen microbiome via sequencing
    to better understand the mode of action. In conjunction with the product manufacturing
    cost, this data will be used to determine the feasibility of this product. Cost
    savings are expected from producing a more environmentally friendly dairy, a reduction
    in foodborne pathogens, a decrease in morbidity/mortality, and an increase in
    feed efficiency.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase I project will leverage the data generated routinely
    by radiation oncology practices to automate the peer-review process in which radiation
    oncologists evaluate the quality of planned treatments. Each cancer patient possesses
    a unique layout of normal anatomy relative to their disease and this impacts the
    characteristics of the treatment delivered. An example is that it is harder to
    achieve a low dose to an organ that is closer to the irradiated tumor. Today,
    quality evaluation for a planned treatment effectively assumes that the anatomical
    geometry of every patient with a given disease is the same. The proposed innovation
    personalizes the evaluation of radiotherapy treatment plans by comparing a patient's
    anatomy to thousands of past patients. The highest standards achieved are used
    as a yardstick for the current patient. Furthermore, plan evaluation is transformed
    from a subjective, error-prone, procedure to an efficient standardized process,
    including sophisticated anomaly detection. The benefit to the patient is lower
    doses to healthy organs and lower risk of their treatment being impacted by errors.
    This can reduce side effects and improve quality of life. The benefit to clinics
    is workflow efficiency and improved quality metrics, resulting in cost savings
    and proof of high practice standards. \n\n\nThe proposed software product is an
    automated peer review system for radiation oncology treatment planning based on
    a large database of existing patient treatment plans. The unique strength of the
    innovation lies in it being based on a large and varied dataset that can provide
    reference patients to which the current patient can be meaningfully compared.
    During the treatment planning process, the system will allow radiation oncologists
    to detect anomalies in dose prescription and structure delineation, as well as
    obtain patient-specific dosimetric objectives against which to evaluate treatment
    plan quality. Machine learning approaches will be used for anomaly detection,
    where deviations from the norm will be flagged as requiring examination. Dosimetric
    objectives will be obtained using a search procedure that considers the geometric
    relationships between each targeted volume and each organ at risk. Automated peer-review
    will allow plan assessment during the treatment planning process itself rather
    than it being a retrospective step after the initiation of a patient's treatment
    course. Prospective review allows for customization based on individual patient
    characteristics and thus expands the role of peer review from quality assurance
    to the personalization of radiation treatments.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory
    mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's

- abstractText: "his SBIR Phase I project will develop an innovative application,
    geared towards the growing emergent bilingual population which enters the educational
    system. Despite their growing size (approximately 20 percent of the total US population),
    emergent bilinguals still do not have adequate support to succeed in an academic
    setting, and are often victims of a subtractive bilingualism process, which eventually
    favors the acquisition of English at the expense of the home language. When this
    happens, the individual child loses a valuable economic and cultural resource,
    as well as the cognitive benefits associated with bilingualism. In turn, society
    loses its multilingual resources and a wealth of cultural knowledge, which is
    necessary for trade and diplomacy with foreign nations, among other things. Therefore,
    the goal of the project is to track the progress of bilingual students throughout
    their education. It aims to support the students' bilingual development by providing
    a research-based, standard-aligned, and child-friendly bilingual literacy and
    cognitive skills assessment tool accompanied by an educational platform where
    teachers, parents, and students can collectively collaborate to promote bilingualism.
    \n\n\nThe project consists of a mobile-device and/or web-based automated bilingual
    assessment of reading, writing and oral skills, that provides real-time results
    to teachers (and parents) of emergent bilinguals. The assessment is intuitive,
    adapting to each child, and is complemented by recommended activities that are
    automatically tailored to each student's needs. The goal is to help teachers gain
    an in-depth understanding of the bilingual student's strengths and weaknesses,
    and to rule out cognitive deficits that are usually wrongly ascribed to bilinguals.
    It is also to help teachers and parents gauge, develop, and nurture the specific
    skill set that emergent bilinguals bring with them and that strongly benefit many
    aspects of society. The R&D plan aims at developing an innovative product that
    stands out from other existing solutions. The key differentiating features are:
    its focus on bilingual children and its adaptability in accepting bilingual answers
    for the assessments, its capacity of assessing oral skills in children thanks
    to the integration of a speech recognizer that will be refined by integrating
    machine learning algorithms trained on children speech data, and the option for
    each student to receive a personalized bundle of analytics and activities that
    fit his/her profile.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been

    the context of how students relate to mathematics in traditional rote fashions,
    and how many populations negatively self-identify with math. It proposes that
    a dynamic visual interface of design and game-based activities can transform the
    way math is perceived, making it more accessible, enjoyable, and impactful. This

    parents, and students (ranging from Kindergarten to a project-centered college
    course) have all recognized the project's ability to engage users of all ages
    and catalyze this transformation. This project is aimed at proof-of-impact for
    early learners (Pre-K through 2nd grade) and helping students appreciate the elegance
    of math, especially for those with very little mathematical background. This will
    establish a foundation for expanded offerings for all ages and will pave clearer
    paths to STEAM careers through positive math identification and improved performance.
    This balance of engagement and transformational impact will establish a sustainable

    will require cross-platform development for Google, Android, and iOS devices.
    Design Mode will allow students to efficiently create beautiful and complex patterns
    and allow teachers to customize lectures that can be reinforced by game mode.
    Game Mode will allow students to solve puzzles that improve their spatial and
    numeracy skills through engaging mechanics and representations. It will focus
    on finding ways of assessing if students are improving their higher order thinking
    skills by measuring the efficiency of their paths to solving problems with multiple

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to empower American workers to compete with low-wage workers abroad by providing a lower cost, more flexible way to fabricate complex aerospace structures than labor-intensive manual drilling. Increases in global demand for aircraft are putting pressure on large Original Equipment Manufacturers to increase rates of production. For example: A large aircraft manufacturer increased production of one of their aircraft from 47 to 52 aircraft per month in 2018 and is anticipated to continue to increase this rate to 57 in March 2019. These rate increases are not just putting pressure on the OEMs but also on their sub-tier suppliers who must increase their rates as well. Many of these smaller companies operate on tight budgets in rural areas with smaller employment pools. They are experiencing difficulty keeping up. By enhancing American worker productivity and quality with robotic systems that rural manufacturers can afford, this project will help keep quality manufacturing jobs in America for the next generation.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will design, build and validate a mobile, agile robotic drilling system for aircraft manufacturing. This system will be capable of interfacing with and operating on existing aircraft assembly jigs broadly used in the industry for manual drilling. The system will deliver 90% reduction in drilling cycle time from 60 to six seconds per hole and eliminate repeat motion injury from hand drilling, while eliminating hole quality and positional accuracy defects associated with hand drilled holes. The system will seek to implement human-robot collaboration through a speed-and-separation monitoring approach.

    This SBIR Phase I project focuses on the development of a smart hydrocephalus shunt system. Senseer's sensor technology is widely applicable to implantable and external catheters for many clinical indications; however, the company's first target application is hydrocephalus, a life-long, incurable disease characterized by a buildup of CSF in the brain's ventricles. It is treatable by chronically implanting a shunt to divert CSF from the brain into the abdominal cavity. Around 90,000 shunts are implanted in the US each year. However, these shunts fail or become obstructed at alarming rates (40% after 1st year of use), quickly leading to permanent brain damage and death without clinical intervention, i.e., shunt replacement. Diagnosing shunt failure is difficult and involves a prolonged assessment period with costly imaging studies and invasive shunt taps. Patients and doctors alike seek an accurate, reliable method for the timely detection of shunt failure. Senseer's MultiSense shunt system, integrated with the company's patented impedimetric sensor technologies, will allow remote, on-demand measurement of shunt status, therapeutic efficacy, and patient health.

    To surpass the limitations of existing implantable sensors, Senseer has patented impedimetric sensors, which are designed to interact directly with physiological fluid and be chronically implanted in  the human body. A combination of sensors (pressure, flow, catheter patency, temperature, and cerebral blood flow waveform) will generate an unprecedented diagnostic data set for data analytics. This will significantly advance the scientific/medical understanding of hydrocephalus, which is limited today by the paucity of data on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hydrodynamics over time. Senseer's system would include several significant first-to-market capabilities, include chronic repeated measurement of cerebrospinal fluid dynamics and automated wireless transduction from multiple sensors to a cloud-based database for analyses and disseminations. Scientific milestones include development of an integrated multi-sensor array for up to five biometric measurements; wireless electronics for inductive power and signal transmission for interrogating implantable sensors; miniaturized packaging with implantable form factor; software for sensor calibration, data storage, and data analysis; and a benchtop hydrocephalus model for system validation.

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase I project will develop and test a minimally invasive
    method and device that blocks pain. The device will offer patients and physicians
    a new non-addictive way of controlling severe pain with the ultimate goal of reducing
    or eliminating society's need for opioids and other narcotics. More than 350,000
    Americans died from opioid overdose during 1999-2016, and the societal cost of
    opioid misuse exceeds $75 billion per year. The number one risk factor of opiate
    addiction is receiving a prescription for opiates. The technology developed in
    this project uses gentle warm and cool temperatures to block the transmission
    of nerve signals without drugs or electric stimulation. Uniquely, this method
    appears to block pain signals across all mammalian and amphibian nerves. The device
    developed in this project will reduce human suffering and risk of addiction by
    giving patients the ability to rapidly adjust how much of a nerve's firing is
    felt. The device will also provide researchers studying neurological mechanisms
    with precise control over nerve conduction. Thermal nerve blocks represent a powerful
    new way of blocking pain and has broad applicability following surgery and across
    a number of disorders and diseases.\n \nGently warming a short section of nerve
    tissue to 45C and then cooling it to 15C can quickly initiate complete nerve block
    that can be maintained by cycling between these temperatures while avoiding nerve
    damage from exposure to higher or lower temperatures. Thermal nerve block will
    be delivered by the minimally invasive device developed in this project, which
    includes an inserted thermal probe and an external microfluidic controller. The
    drug-free, non-addictive, device will provide continuous block of severe pain
    initially for peri- and post-operative pain management. This project will build
    prototype thermal tips that can be inserted via 5mm introducer sheath, refine
    the device implantation technique and optimize thermal performance in vitro before
    demonstrating the utility of the system for thermal block of intercostal pain
    in C-fiber evoked potential experiments in anesthetized felines. The thermal tips
    will be held in place with non-permanent anchoring silicone tynes, while the external
    wearable controller will have battery-powered micro-piezo pump, thermoelectric
    heater/cooler, and microcontroller. This minimally invasive design offers an effective
    alternative for controlling severe pain that does not attenuate over time and
    brings no risk of addiction.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
    has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual
    merit and broader impacts review criteria."

    This SBIR Phase I project aims to improve the surgical treatment used for patients suffering from open angle glaucoma (OAG), through the development and testing of the world's thinnest ocular implant. OAG is the most common form of glaucoma, the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world. By 2020, glaucoma will affect 3.4 million people in the U.S. and 80 million people globally. In the U.S., glaucoma incurs over $4 billion in medical and societal costs per year. For patients with glaucoma, elevated eye pressure must be lowered to protect the optic nerve from damage. However, conventional surgical implant treatments are bulky, highly invasive, and cause chronic discomfort. While newer, smaller devices are less invasive, they present issues with long-term efficacy as they inadequately sustain lower eye pressure when scarring occurs. This project will develop an implant many times thinner than a human hair to safely reduce eye pressure while minimizing the risk of patient discomfort and failure from scarring. The nanotechnology-enabled device will be designed to facilitate biocompatibility, patient comfort, and physician insertion through a combination of mechanical and materials engineering. Beyond the application in glaucoma, the technology developed will play a key role in future permanent and efficacious ocular implants - a rapidly growing component of vision care.

    This innovation involves careful engineering of the materials composition and microarchitecture of an ultrathin implant to treat glaucoma. Specifically, the project will optimize a novel corrugated microstructure for a unique combination of mechanical and fluid flow properties. Specific corrugations will provide the stiffness required for handling by physicians, as well as the flexibility to conform to soft eye tissues. Microchannels from the corrugations will also be patterned to provide adequate flow for reducing intraocular pressure, while providing enough resistance to prevent overly low pressure. Microscale architecture and materials will first be engineered through experimental testing of tensile stiffness, bending stiffness, shear strength, aqueous stability, and pressure flow characteristics. The implant with the optimal materials microarchitecture will subsequently be studied in an in vivo leporine eye model. This study will monitor intraocular pressure, scar tissue formation, levels of inflammation, adverse events, and implant stability. Together, the bench and pre-clinical tests will provide critical data for further refinement of this implant and facilitate progress towards realizing an optimal defense against blindness.

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase I project will address key hurdles for commercialization
    of an injectable breast tissue replacement for use immediately following breast
    conserving surgery, otherwise known as lumpectomy. Surgeons using this procedure
    today have limited options for predictably restoring normal breast size, shape,
    and consistency following tumor removal. Because of this, many women are left
    with breast deformities or must undergo multiple surgical procedures. These issues
    compromise their psychological well-being and quality of life and increase healthcare
    costs. With these challenges in mind, this project will evaluate the ability of
    a patented, liquid, fibril-forming collagen to serve as an injectable, breast
    tissue replacement. Upon injection, this liquid biopolymer self-assembles into
    a physically stable and persistent natural fibrillar scaffold, meaning it can
    be used to fill patient-specific tissue voids. Project results will provide early-stage
    preclinical evidence of this biopolymer's effectiveness for filling and regenerating
    breast tissue in a large animal lumpectomy model. If successfully translated to
    the clinic, this therapy would provide breast cancer surgeons with a much-needed
    regenerative breast tissue solution. This in turn, would boost surgeons' confidence
    when working to achieve complete tumor removal, improve quality of life for breast
    cancer survivors, and decrease overall costs of care. \n\nThe liquid collagen
    polymers evaluated in this proposal preserve several natural features of the collagen
    protein as it exists in the body, thus giving rise to three key advantages. First,
    this biomaterial has the ability to rapidly transition from liquid to solid, forming
    natural collagen-fibril scaffolds just like those in the body's tissues. Second,
    it is amenable to customization and advanced biofabrication with tailorable geometries,
    fibril architectures, and mechanical properties. And finally, these scaffolds
    stably integrate and persist in vivo, inducing site-appropriate tissue generation
    without evoking immune or inflammatory response. This project seeks to overcome
    technical hurdles associated with identifying compatible and scalable sterilization
    and manufacturing processes for this unique, liquid biomaterial. Additionally,
    project activities will seek to specify biopolymer formulations that support surgeon
    ease-of-use, provide efficacy for breast tissue replacement, and do not interfere
    with standard clinical practices (e.g. radiation and re-excision procedures).
    The outcomes of this proposal will provide valuable proof-of-concept for a viable
    medical-grade manufacturing process and early preclinical validation that these
    collagen polymers can address breast cancer patient-specific needs. Finally, this
    project will lay the foundation for this natural collagen polymer to serve as
    an enabling tool for next generation personalized regenerative medicine therapies.\n\nThis

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is an opportunity to open up new applications
    that depend on mobile power and dramatically lower the cost of residential, commercial,
    and utility-scale solar power. The project will develop lightweight, flexible,
    and extremely efficient photovoltaic (PV) modules using perovskite absorbers.
    Double-junction or tandem solar cells can reach far higher power conversion efficiencies
    than traditional single-junction cells (45% vs. 32%) by using two absorbing layers
    that absorb complementary parts of the solar spectrum; however, tandem cells have
    previously been too expensive for mainstream applications. This project uses perovskite
    materials to make tandem solar cells on flexible substrates at a lower cost than
    conventional cells by using high-throughput manufacturing and lower-cost materials.
    These efficient, lightweight, and flexible modules will open the door to long-endurance
    unmanned aerial vehicles, supplemental charging for electric cars, solar power
    for commercial buildings with roofs too weak for typical panels, and lower installation,
    module, and total system costs for residential, commercial, and utility-scale
    solar plants. \n\nThe proposed project addresses the technical challenges associated
    with making flexible perovskite tandem solar cells efficient, stable, and low
    cost. Perovskite tandem solar cells have been demonstrated previously, but never
    in a lightweight and flexible format. Such a format creates unique technical challenges
    associated with delamination of the many layers in the tandem device stack, and
    further requires every layer to be robust to fracture. A critical area of work
    for flexible perovskite tandem solar cells is in developing robust, flexible,
    and dense diffusion barrier layers that can both conduct current and block the
    migration of ionic species between various layers. Much of the proposed work focuses
    on optimizing these barrier layers to prevent various degradation modes, some
    general to all perovskite solar cells and some unique to perovskite tandem solar
    cells. Other key focus areas include developing a flexible device architecture
    with improved adhesion between layers and a flexible encapsulation strategy. Realizing
    these goals will pave the way for highly efficient and flexible solar cells at
    substantially lower costs than today?s leading solar technologies.\n\nThis award

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is a technology that enables the development of novel therapeutics to treat a range of serious genetic neurodegenerative diseases. The proposed drug delivery platform would help improve the understanding of the root cause of certain genetic neurodegenerative diseases. Further, new therapeutics to treat the root cause of severe neurogenerative disorders would have strong commercial potential. Currently, patients have limited treatment options and require significant and costly supportive care. New therapeutics would both improve the lives of patients and create value for insurance providers by reducing the need for costly care.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to demonstrate proof-of-concept for a genomic targeting drug-delivery platform. Unstable nucleotide repeats in the genome have been identified as the root cause of over 20 neurodegenerative conditions. These are debilitating disorders with high disease burden impacting millions of lives. Most nucleotide repeat expansion diseases are caused by a toxic gain-of-function mutation in a single allele. These diseases show dominant inheritance where most patients have a normal, unaffected copy. Silencing expression of the disease allele would address the root cause of the disease, completely halt progression of degenerative symptoms, and likely enable patients to regain lost function. The proposed effort seeks to develop a proof-of-concept allele-specific gene modulator that silences the mutant allele in myotonic dystrophy 1 (DMPK). Using this drug delivery platform, the objective is to synthesize molecules that would target transcriptional repressors specifically to the diseased DMPK allele. Using patient cells, the plan is to test for molecules that silence expression from the repeat containing diseased DMPK allele without impacting the healthy copy.

    This SBIR Phase I project seeks to develop a novel software solution to treat convergence insufficiency (CI), a binocular vision disorder that affects 5% of the general population, as well as 50% of patients with post concussive syndrome. Typical symptoms of CI include double/blurry vision, headaches, dizziness, eye stress and strain, and nausea when performing tasks close to the face, such as reading. In addition, a childhood diagnosis of CI is correlated with the diagnosis of an attention disorder and difficulty in school. This project aims to build a software platform that turns any game playable in supported virtual reality (VR) headsets into a therapeutic experience that will treat CI. While current therapy protocols are generally effective in treating CI, patient engagement can be particularly low in pediatric populations especially within the home setting, due to the repetitive nature of common therapeutic activities. By allowing pediatric patients to play any VR game of their choosing, this project will increase engagement in the therapeutic intervention, and permit patients to complete schoolwork without visual symptoms sooner than with traditional therapy protocols.

    The software designed during this project is unique in both function and implementation. Functionally, this software effectively breaks the elements of VR that create visual comfort for binocularly normal players. To do this for any VR game on a supported headset, this software interacts with core device parameters, transforming any delivered content into a therapeutic experience. This project will develop a fully functional prototype software capable of delivering vision therapy in this novel way. Specific goals of the project include creating software specifications, prototype development, and multiple levels of software testing. As well, this project will evaluate the current and future VR ecosystem to design software that is robust to future updates and is useable on the primary dominant commercially available VR system.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this STTR project is to chemically recycle carbon dioxide, which would otherwise be released to the atmosphere, to useful fuels and products thus providing a closed loop for production and emissions for many common products. Virtually every industry uses petroleum and/or natural gas, either through transportation or plastics (e.g., packaging), and there is no current commercial CO2 /carbon recycling process. The current routes for CO2 conversion are crippled by one or more of the following challenges: (a) very low rates of CO2 conversion, (b) high temperature of operation, (c) non-selective product formation, and (d) issues with scalability of the process.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to re-purpose CO2 from a pollutant to a feedstock for fuels and chemicals. Recent research has achieved a proof-of-concept on reverse water-gas shift chemical looping (RWGS-CL). Carbon monoxide (CO), a major component of synthesis gas, is selectively produced, which can be used as the backbone to any chemical or fuel through existing processes. Preliminary performance results and literature findings indicate that this process operation could contribute to unprecedented efficiencies and potential scalability within a small footprint compared to other futuristic technologies that convert CO2. The RWGS-CL process operates at reasonable temperatures with high CO2 conversion rates and highly selective towards CO formation. The RWGS-CL process is thus, unique and transformative in that it addresses all of the major challenges and paves the way for a sustainable generation of greener hydrocarbon fuels at industrial scale. This project aims to enable prototype construction of the technology at 100 x scale of lab tests using formed materials (pellets) capable of operating at industrial scale, a reactor model to capture the performance and size of the RWGS-CL unit, and a techno-economic analysis.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to transform the manner in which people and entities engage in transfer of value.   In our current economy, many businesses operate as middlemen between the producer of a good or service and the consumer of that good or service. Examples of such businesses can be categorized as financial services, exchange services, and regulated utilities. These intermediaries create a large inefficiency on producers, consumers, and the economy as a whole. Many of these businesses can be replaced partly or in whole by open source public blockchains. Over time, open-source public blockchains will competitively evolve to deliver the highest economic value for all market participants at the lowest cost. Although blockchain technology has enormous promise to positively impact society, current public blockchains have not been able to scale sufficiently to meet the needs of most enterprise applications.


    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop BlockReduce: a scalable, trustless, public blockchain for enterprise applications. BlockReduce presents a new blockchain topology to offer 3+ orders of magnitude improvement in transaction throughput while avoiding the introduction of hierarchical power structures and centralization. Additionally, BlockReduce is able to provide low-cost transactions with stable fees, which is key to enabling countless enterprise applications. By answering the issues of scale, cost, and access to public blockchains, BlockReduce will be the catalyst for enterprises moving from proof-of-concept (PoC) blockchain demonstrations to full scale deployments. If successful, BlockReduce could serve as fundamental infrastructure for digital value exchanges much like ethernet was technological infrastructure for digital information exchange.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project includes advances in scientific understanding and substantial societal and commercial impacts. In an era with seemingly endless data breaches, the project offers a way of applying the power of machine learning while never disclosing sensitive raw data. Decentralized computation can increase the scale of models that may be trained, which will allow the use of deep learning on more complicated problems across a range of fields. Additionally, allowing confidential data to be used will allow more rapid research advances in fields with sensitive data, such as biomedicine. Furthermore, decentralized computation offers the promise of lower cost than existing computational infrastructures such as cloud providers. This greater, and more democratic, power will push the boundaries of the state-of-the-art and also enable more people to leverage large-scale machine learning.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to advance knowledge in the area of coordinating decentralized secure machine learning with a blockchain in a manner that maintains data confidentiality and ensures verifiability. The R&D will also advance understanding and practicality of zero knowledge computational verification and homomorphic neural networks. While deep neural networks have yielded astounding results in recent years, there has been limited progress towards achieving a practical solution to training models in a decentralized context while both maintaining data confidentiality and ensuring verifiability. This is the key challenge and it is anticipated that this project will yield a solution. The proposed approach involves defining a protocol for training amongst untrusted parties that is mediated by a decentralized ledger and involves the use of homomorphic encryption and a computational verification technique.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will be to advance cryopreservation technologies for the development of a seed banking product for commercially important aquaculture species.  Genetic banking of plant cells, tissues, seeds, and embryos is common practice in agriculture to ensure important genetic lines are not lost due to disease outbreak or environmental catastrophe. However, genetic banking of embryos and larvae within the aquaculture industry is nonexistent to date, and the investments made toward genetic improvements are susceptible to catastrophic loss without a proper seed banking product. The inability to reliably preserve seed for long periods of time is currently a barrier to the formation of an aquaculture seed storage product. This research will enhance scientific and technological understanding for the cryopreservation of aquatic organisms and be a transformative step to protect genetic resources vital to the commercial aquaculture industry.  These technological advancements also can be adapted for the conservation of threatened or endangered aquatic organisms important to food security and ecosystem health domestically and abroad.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a technology to implement a genetic banking product that allows aquaculture facilities to "cryobank" thousands of seeds from family lines developed over years of selective breeding programs.  Recent advancements in rapid cooling for storage at liquid nitrogen temperatures (-196 degrees C) and ultra-rapid rewarming (~107  degrees C/min) have led to major breakthroughs in cryopreservation research. These advancements will be utilized to develop a low throughput, high efficacy strategy for the successful cryopreservation of an important aquaculture species, Litopenaeus vannamei or Pacific white shrimp.  Protocol optimization for cryoprotective agent loading/unloading, vitrification, and ultra-rapid warming will result in high revival, survival, and grow out to post larval stages.  Once proven, the technique will be scaled up to develop a high throughput process to successfully cryopreserve >10,000 samples per day.  This technology will enable the commercial aquaculture industry to conserve important genetic strains and stockpile cryopreserved seed at the levels necessary to avoid interruptions to food supply commonly caused by disease outbreaks and environmental catastrophe.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology
    Transfer (STTR) project is the integration of energy conversion and energy storage
    technologies into a single ribbon called the Solar Supercapacitor (SolarCap).
    The innovative aspect of SolarCap technology is that it is a self-powering ribbon
    which can be weaved along with cotton fibers to make a fabric. Batteries are currently
    being employed for powering wearable electronics used in remote places during
    multiple day trips with limited supplies and resources. However, most batteries
    are heavy, have a short life span, and are expensive, and transporting them to
    hostile locations can be difficult and dangerous. The SolarCap ribbons will have
    a considerable commercial impact since it can be used to charge the wearable electronics
    devices while woven on the user's backpack, clothing, etc. The proposed study
    will answer several key scientific questions including energy storage capability,
    stability, charge-recharge cycle life and durability of the SolarCap ribbons.
    The core value of the proposed SolarCap is that it can provide soldiers, firefighters,
    first responders, and outdoor personals increased mobility, comfort, flexibility,
    and peace of mind concerning device's electrical power while in the field. It
    can also reduce the physical load carried by the user. \n\n\nThis Small Business
    Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project eliminates the requirement of distinct
    devices for energy harvesting and storage. Using distinct devices for energy harvesting
    and storage can be a significant issue for those who are working at remote outdoor
    places. This is because, once the battery power of a device is drained, the outdoor
    personnel should find a place to charge the battery. The objective of this proposal
    is to develop a wearable self-powering SolarCap ribbon by integrating solar cells
    and supercapacitors on a ribbon. To accomplish this goal, a flexible perovskite
    solar cell (PSC) will be developed on a conductive ribbon. A hybrid supercapacitor
    device will be integrated with the PSC to store the harvested energy. These two
    devices will be so integrated that a direct electric charge transfer can take
    place from solar cell to the storage device. The proposed SolarCap ribbons are
    anticipated to deliver more than 8% solar power conversion efficiency and an energy
    density of more than 20WhKg -1. The size of the ribbons will be so designed to
    weave along with cotton filaments to make a self-powering fabric.\n\nThis award
    reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
    evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review

    protection of municipal-level first responders and local communities from radiological
    hazards through affordable continuous wide-area radiation monitoring (RM). Radiological
    threats range from the ultimate high-consequence-rare-event posed by radiological
    dispersal devices and stolen or unaccounted for special nuclear material to more
    common and routine radiological events triggered by radiological sources from
    construction, power, medicine, and industry. Regardless of the threat, current
    radiological equipment and training is inadequate, and first responders are ill-equipped
    to deal with radiological incidents that occur in urban environments. Due to technology
    and training costs, comprehensive radiation surveillance systems can be adopted
    by only the largest and wealthiest cities, leaving most municipalities and local
    first responders unprotected. The project will develop an RM system that is easily
    deployed, alerts to spectral anomalies as well as radiation levels, requires no
    specialized training for front-line operators, and is vastly more cost effective
    than existing systems. This RM system can be deployed in a variety of complex
    environments regardless of size or density. The end result is accurate, real-time
    mapping of large geographical areas that can be used to detect, analyze, and interpret
    radiation levels in a variety of environments. \n\nThis Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase I project provides innovative approaches in building a spatial-temporal-spectral
    database of gamma radiation to monitor change detection over large urban areas.
    The concept is to improve general radiation awareness as well as source detection
    capability by having continuous monitoring. Rather than attempting to identify
    specific isotopes in spectral observations ? which is difficult at long distances
    and requires highly sensitive detectors ? it is possible to detect temporal anomalies
    in spectral shape by keeping a database of past observations. This provides for
    profound increases in detection distance or likewise, in faint source detection.
    For successful commercialization of the RM system, innovative research is needed
    in two main areas: 1) universal multi-sensor integration through boot-strapped
    autocalibration and integrated continuous health monitoring, which this proposal
    will address via field deployment of multiple sensors to characterize with novel
    sensor-to-sensor fusion methodologies; and 2) municipal infrastructure optimization
    that will permit surveys to be conducted in a distributed fashion without dedicated
    survey vehicles, which this proposal will address by collecting data and building
    operational research optimization models for key aspects of the mobile sensor
    deployment concept, answering critical questions on the economic viability of
    the approach.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the development of a high-power GaN half-bridge (HPGHB) module which is a generic building block for most power-electronic systems. Hence, HPGHB can be used in most high current converter applications. This project will start with high electric-vehicle (EV) application in collaboration with a well-known automotive parts maker. EVs need to be widely adopted in advanced cities and in the rural/underdeveloped world. High-power off-board charger may not always be available; hence high-power on-board charger (OBC), which is the topic of this STTR, is a critical enabler for wider adoption of EV leading to reduced carbon emission. On the educational front, this STTR will help train graduate students at the University to use GaN for power electronics which is a high demand area. Companies will be able to recruit and benefit from training of graduate students. Finally, regarding knowledge dissemination, technology developed under this proposal will be showcased in an exhibition booth at IEEE conferences like APEC and ECCE.


    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project aims to develop a robust and high-current HPGHB and a reference design for a fast-OBC by incorporating HPGHB. High-current integrated GaN HB is extraordinarily challenging from the point of high dV/dT control, short-circuit protection and thermal management. HPGHB is planned for areas where long-term reliability is important, such as in automotive/EV applications. This STTR plans to research design of HPGHB with various knobs to increase its reliability in demanding applications including EVs. Development of a fast-OBC with high efficiency and high-power density will accelerate the adoption of EVs. Planned OBC plans to use innovative multi-level topologies to enable use of low-cost 650V GaN-HEMT technology. Key challenges for this STTR project are a) protection against very-high dV/dt (of at least 150V/nS); b) protection against short circuit to prevent catastrophic damage; c) high efficiency to reduce cooling requirement and reduce size and weight; d) multilevel converter to enable usage of relatively-lower cost GaN-on-Si technology; e) good long-term reliability for automotive/EV market is addressed via dynamic high-temperature-operating-life (HTOL) test; and f) reduced overall system cost by minimizing the cost related to hot probing of the wafer which is the current practice.

    Research project is that the proposed chemical reactor utilizes methane from natural
    gas, a native resource, and waste carbon dioxide from industrial processes to
    create syngas, a widely used industrial gas. Syngas is a crucial resource for
    production of hydrogen, ammonia, methanol, and synthetic fuels. Hydrogen can be
    used as a clean alternative fuel to gasoline, ammonia is used in the production
    of fertilizer for food, and methanol can be used to produce olefins that are used
    to produce plastics. This chemical reactor uses LED light as an energy source
    instead of heat from burning fuel to consume two potent greenhouse gases and create
    a commercially relevant product at a competitive price. Using LED light allows
    for the use of renewable electricity, whenever available, to power the chemical
    reaction, in effect electrifying the chemical manufacturing process and reducing
    its carbon emissions. Some commercial benefits of this reactor are: (a) it is
    low-cost: built out of cost-effective materials such as glass, (b) it can startup
    and shut down on demand, (c) it can be made into large plants or efficiently scaled-down
    to build small-scale distributed reactor to produce syngas at the point-of-application.
    \n\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes to build and demonstrate a bench-scale
    photoreactor for dry methane reforming (DMR) reaction that uses LED light as its
    primary energy source. To date, DMR has not achieved commercialization due to
    very high temperature requirements and lack of commercially relevant stable catalyst.
    The presented photocatalyst overcomes the previous challenges with DMR. At lab-scale,
    it has has shown unprecedented high reaction rate, selectivity, and stability
    after long duration testing. This 6-month project will focus on three foundational
    aspects critical to this technology development: (a) develop a multi-physics thermal
    model of the bench-scale reactor in COMSOL to understand the energetic effects
    of the incident light and the endothermicity of the reaction on the catalyst bed,
    (b) build a bench-scale reactor and perform photocatalysis experiments to measure
    and optimize reaction rates and energy efficiency, (c) build a techno-economic
    model that can be used to determine the feasibility of this reactor for commercialization.
    Upon successful completion of the project, the reactor will be ready for a larger

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is the development of an ambient-temperature nucleic acid sample management system that can efficiently and cost-effectively scale to meet the demands of life science and data science needs. Recent market trends show a significant expansion in DNA archival and access requirements, with applications in personal genomics services for health and ancestry; forensic, precision medicine, and agricultural sample storage; and future digital information storage using DNA sequences. Current market-available DNA storage methods rely on cold-temperature storage in room-size chambers, with the DNA typically kept in biologically active media that is prone to degradation by freeze-thaw cycling, power failure, sample contamination, or sample loss. The goal of this work is to develop a method of DNA sample management that allows ambient sample storage combined with rapid access with native chemical and thermal protection. This work will lead to a device-based approach for sample management that will scale with the growing demands of industry.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop technological and engineering requirements for scalable bead-based encapsulation of DNA samples, retrievable with molecular-biology grade purity for downstream cloning and sequencing. Micron-scale DNA sample archival and access will be accomplished by a two-stage method for protecting and barcoding individual samples. New processes and protocols will be developed for the precise and reliable encapsulation of DNA in 10 micrometer condensed particles that additionally allow for barcode identification. Methods will be specifically developed such that the retrieval of the sample out of the particle will be nondestructive and of high quality for downstream applications. Random access will be achieved by enrichment of those particles displaying the barcode of interest. This research will lead to a revolutionary micron-scale DNA management architecture for archival, offering massive improvement in capacity, decreased operating costs and increased sample integrity. Specific technical innovations include DNA encapsulation methods for long-term DNA archival and molecular barcoding of microparticles for retrieval.

    technology application for the development of emotional literacy among adolescent
    and adult learners. Emotional literacy is increasingly recognized as a universal
    need that is critical to one's academic and professional success and psychological
    health, as well as for society's cohesion and tolerance. At the same time, modern
    emotion science indicates that emotions operate on the basis of certain basic,
    universal principles, which represent the deep structure of our social and emotional
    life. The present application will focus on teaching these fundamental principles,
    encapsulated by a comprehensive emotion system model developed based on the latest
    scientific research. To foster deep learning, the training will emphasize inference-making
    and the use of simulations, while being grounded in high quality narrative such
    as literature and film. Training exercise generation will be partially automated
    to provide content variability. The project has the potential to have a broader
    impact on education practice and outcomes by leading to more robust, transferable,
    and measurable learning of social-emotional concepts and skills. It promises to
    make a further valuable societal contribution by offering an affordable, effective
    and engaging mobile solution for enhancing emotional literacy among the general
    population, helping to build a more aware, tolerant, just, and peaceful society.
    At the same time, the application has the potential to capture a significant portion
    of a combined $1.5 billion social-emotional learning and consumer emotional wellness
    market, resulting in a self-sustaining business generating jobs and significant
    income for tax revenue. \n\n\nThe project entails a number of technical innovations,
    including: a data model and management system for the encoding of emotion episodes
    in literature and film; an emotion exercise generation engine for automating the
    creation of training exercises; an effective user interface for the presentation
    of emotion principles and the associated training exercises, particularly those
    involving emotion system simulation; and emotion knowledge performance analytics
    dashboard(s). The main goals of the proposed R&D include: assessing the viability
    of developing the emotion exercise generation engine and a production-ready version
    of the application; evaluating the benefits of the training for application users;
    and assessing the commercial viability of the product in the educational and consumer
    markets. The technical goals will be achieved through rapid, agile development
    using technologies such as python, a cross-platform mobile development framework
    such as React Native, and a graph database like Neo4J. Platform training benefits
    will be evaluated using randomized control studies at multiple stages of product
    development to allow for iteration and improvement. Commercial viability will
    be assessed through direct outreach to schools and other educational institutions,
    as well as a beta launch aimed at the consumer market.\n\nThis award reflects

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the improvements to the strength, durability, and longevity of concrete infrastructure and construction materials with novel graphene-rich carbon nanomaterial additives. Advancement of this technology area (advanced materials/nanomaterials for infrastructure applications) will directly reduce the costs of construction and maintenance ($165B/year in public spending) while supporting the nation's core economic activities ($14T/year in transported goods). The enhanced strength and longevity of nanocarbon coatings and concrete composites will reduce the amount of raw material required to meet specifications resulting in a net reduction of greenhouse gas emissions (concrete production is responsible for 7% of global GHG emissions). The innovation will enhance scientific understanding of the effect of graphene-rich additives on the permeability and strength of concrete and coating composites using both advanced analytical techniques (x-ray tomography) and industry standard procedures (ASTM testing). It will also enhance understanding of the processing required (e.g. functionalization and dispersion) to integrate graphene-rich additives into polyurethane materials and concrete. Additionally, the project will help refine the plasma-based process conditions to produce carbon materials optimized for these applications.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will demonstrate enhancement of mechanical properties and impermeability of construction materials' concrete and concrete coatings using graphene-rich nanocarbon additives derived from microwave plasma conversion of natural gas. The permeability of concrete is its primary pitfall and is responsible for the two most common causes of failure: carbonation and chloride contamination. Sealants can extend concrete's lifespan but are expensive to apply and often deteriorate rapidly due to environmental effects (UV, chemicals, mechanical abrasion). Graphene additives can enhance the barrier properties and mechanical strength of concrete and sealants, but are currently too costly for construction and infrastructure applications. The objective of this project is to enhance the barrier and mechanical properties of concrete and sealants using a novel graphene-based carbon nanomaterial produced using a cost-effective, scalable, plasma-based process. Carbon nanomaterials will be produced at varied process conditions and, following post-treatment and functionalization, will be incorporated into polyurethane formulations and concrete mixtures. Water and chloride penetration into composites will be examined using advanced x-ray tomographic 3D imaging. Composites will undergo further testing in accordance with AASHTO/ASTM-standards. The anticipated results will establish the technical benefits of using graphene-based nanocarbon additives in concrete and sealants.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to develop technology to address a significant pain point for farmers associated with reducing nitrogen fertilizer input costs. The technology is based on in-planta sensor technology that will allow farmers to more carefully and precisely tailor nitrogen applications to each part of each field. By monitoring nitrate accumulation within plants, farmers will receive real time readouts of which fields and which portions of fields are nutrient constrained and could produce more yield following the application of additional nitrogen fertilizer.  These readouts also will identify those fields that already have sufficient nitrogen, meaning that further applications would simply reduce farmer profit and environmental sustainability. Widescale adoption and use of these sensors will not only improve farmer profitability, but also improve water quality and ecosystem health via reductions in agricultural losses of reactive nitrogen.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop an in-planta sensor for monitoring nitrate concentrations in plants at low cost and in near real time. Existing stalk nitrogen measurement must be conducted in a laboratory setting, requiring farmers to collect samples, mail them to a testing lab, and wait from one to two weeks to receive test results. The cost of the laboratory testing is high enough that only a fraction of farmers conducts nitrogen testing. The in-planta nitrate sensor technology will allow farmers to appropriately sample their fields and provide rapid feedback, allowing farmers (or their crop advisors) to incorporate the data into real-time decisions. This project seeks to develop an in-planta sensor through the fusion of silicon-based microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology and novel nanomaterials. The project will overcome major technical challenges through improving materials, fabrications, packaging, and validation, including optimizing MEMS fabrication processes to minimize sensors at low cost, improving packaging robustness for sensors, and validating sensor prototypes in a greenhouse. The in-planta sensor will directly detect stalk nitrate concentrations with minimal invasion, while being robust to interference from other ions present in the plant stem or stalk.

    Research (SBIR) project will be a platform to identify new immunotherpeutics for
    the treatment of cancer. For a variety of human diseases, cancer in particular,
    several recently approved immunotherapeutics can effectively treat and, in some
    cases, cure several forms of cancer that were considered fatal. Unfortunately,
    there are only a handful of these treatments currently available, and the cost
    is high. This project aims to develop a new technology that may empower biopharma

    to benefit patients with unmet medical needs. \n\nThis SBIR Phase I is a proposal
    to evaluate a cutting-edge single-cell-interaction platform technology for its
    potential to accelerate the discovery of immunotherapeutics, specifically, the
    bispecific T cell engagers (BiTEs), a clinically validated class of bispecific
    antibodies. BiTEs consist of two distinct domains that can simultaneously bind
    to a T cell target and a tumor target.  BiTEs' unique ability to link T cells
    to tumor cells allows them to exhibit improved specificity and efficacy, in part
    through a novel mode of action, by activating T cells to kill tumor cells. However,
    the development process for BiTEs has been very slow, limiting their clinical
    availability for a broad range of devastating diseases. A recurring challenge
    in the field is the lack of a robust platform that is capable of rapid and efficient
    identification of lead BiTE candidates in a cost-effective manner. The current
    proposal aims to prove the technical and operational feasibility of the proposed
    microfluidic-based single-cell-interaction platform technology that can directly
    interrogate the functions of many individual BiTE variants in a compartmentalized
    assay format.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project will be to improve the safety testing of new drugs for approval by the FDA.  By decreasing the time and costs associated with safety testing, the product will make all classes of new drugs safer, less expensive and available to patients sooner.  All new drugs must demonstrate that they are safe.  One common and critical point at which new candidate treatments fail is because they have the serious side effect of promoting sudden cardiac death through lethal arrhythmias. This product combines advanced biological techniques with advanced computing to develop a system that will enable pharma and biotech companies to more rapidly and accurately identify pro-arrhythmic drugs earlier in the development process, thus saving drug companies significant costs associated with drug development. Drugs that ultimately fail cardiac safety screening need to be eliminated as soon as possible from the development pipeline, and certainly pre-clinically. A drug that makes it to clinical trials before cardiac side effects are identified can result in significant wasted costs, in addition to the human cost. Conversely, a drug incorrectly eliminated also can be costly, both in terms of lost revenue and benefit to society.

    This STTR Phase I is a proposal to improve the extraction of key data from experiments on the HERG ion channel and its interpretation through computational modeling in the new FDA CiPA initiative. Preclinical safety testing currently focuses on two interdependent questions: 1) Does the drug block the HERG channel? and 2) Does the drug prolong the action potential? The CiPA initiative proposes to integrate this process systematically, through screening of a defined set of cloned ion channels in high throughput systems and combing this with action potential modelling through the qNet index. The HERG channel is handled separately using a complex state-dependent block model that due to its complexity requires very difficult and time consuming manual measurements. This proposal will automate this process by using a real-time interface to computer model block and evaluate the information coming from voltage clamp experiments as they occur.  As such it will be an artificial intelligence that will substitute for the judgement of a human experimenter by focusing only on protocols and exposure times that define the kinetics of a particular drug.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project involves the advancement of biomaterials development for nerve repair. Each year in the U.S. alone, surgeons perform around 550,000 procedures to repair peripheral nerves affected by traumatic or iatrogenic nerve injury, which are associated with an economic burden due to loss in employee productivity in excess of $150B per year. Peripheral Nerve Injury (PNI) can severely impact the quality of life, productivity, and interpersonal relationships of injured patients. Existing materials are primarily indicated for use as passive support or to prevent complications (e.g., mechanical instability, neuroma, or donor site morbidity associated with autograft). None of these products has shown clinical improvement in functional outcomes. As such, any technology or method that can accelerate or improve nerve repair is of significant interest as it can improve quality of life for those with nerve injuries and reduce the economic burden associated with long term disability for those with nerve injuries.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to undertake the initial development and testing of a porcine tissue-based nerve conduit.  The objective of this proposal is to fabricate conduits that have suitable mechanical, structural, and biological properties to provide an ideal environment for nerve repair and regeneration in nerve gap injuries. The proposed work includes the development and in vitro characterization of the conduit, as well as in vivo testing in a small animal model of nerve gap repair. The animal study will compare the functional outcomes obtained with the proposed conduits with those obtained with commercially available conduits and autografts. Pilot studies have suggested that the proposed conduits have the potential to promote key early events in the nerve regeneration process leading to the formation of functional nerve tissue. The expected outcome is that the proposed conduits will be superior to existing nerve guides and allografts, enabling improvements in nerve repair and providing improvements in the clinical care of affected patients.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to advance the development of a new method for rapid and accurate DNA synthesis. The ability to synthesize "gene-length" DNA molecules (>500 bases) is invaluable for biological and biomedical research and is a key enabling technology for the rapidly growing field of synthetic biology. Existing methods for producing DNA sequences rely on organic chemistry and are generally limited to the direct synthesis of 200 base molecules, necessitating further assembly into gene-length products. However, the assembly process used is failure-prone and not compatible with all desired sequences. The technology being developed in this project will demonstrate the development of a new DNA synthesis method based on enzymes, which, in contrast to organic chemistry, promises to enable the direct synthesis of gene-length DNA molecules. An additional benefit of enzymatic DNA synthesis is that it is performed in aqueous conditions using nontoxic reagents, whereas chemical DNA synthesis uses toxic reagents and produces hazardous waste. The enzymatic DNA synthesis method, once fully developed, will be the core technology supporting a rapid DNA synthesis service that will accelerate research in life sciences and synthetic biology.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop optimized "TdT-dNTP conjugate" reagents for a new enzymatic DNA synthesis method. The exquisite specificity of enzymes promises to enable the direct synthesis of much longer DNA constructs than is possible with the industry-standard chemical DNA synthesis method in use today, accelerating workflows in synthetic biology. A TdT-dNTP conjugate consists of the "template-independent polymerase" enzyme TdT with a tethered nucleoside triphosphate substrate that can be incorporated into a DNA molecule by TdT. After adding the tethered nucleotide to a DNA molecule, the polymerase remains attached to the end of the DNA molecule via the tether to the added nucleotide, blocking other conjugate molecules from further extending the DNA molecule, and thus ensuring that the molecule only gets extended by one nucleotide. The linkage can then be cleaved to release the polymerase and expose the DNA molecule for subsequent extension. Previous research has demonstrated that TdT-dNTP conjugates based on a photocleavable linker can be used for stepwise de novo DNA synthesis. This project proposes to develop new TdT-dNTP conjugates based on a linker that can be rapidly and specifically cleaved using a hydrolase enzyme, finally realizing the promise of a fully-enzymatic DNA synthesis method.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) project will be a method to improve shrimp farming using sonar
    and analytical software.  The $45 billion shrimp industry operates with little
    understanding of how many shrimp are in a pond. Farmers take a \"best guess\"
    type of approach using incomplete and often inaccurate information to make daily
    decisions that results in poor feed to biomass conversion rates, suboptimal harvest
    timing and a variety of supply chain traceability and management issues. The goal
    of this project is to develop a noninvasive sonar-based assessment system to improve
    the accuracy and convenience of estimating shrimp abundance and growth in-situ.
    The proposed system will provide the farmer with actionable data that lead to
    the following value propositions: reducing the feed conversion ratio (feed titration),
    increasing profitability (determine harvest time), accounting controls (farmers
    with multiple sites controlling production), maximizing growth conditions (stocking
    density), reducing risk factors (biosecurity), and taking emergency action (crop
    triage). \n\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a sensor and analytics
    platform that would allow for estimation of shrimp biomass and behavior in real-time,
    informing decision making and best practices in shrimp aquaculture. By optimizing
    a series of networked underwater sonar sensors, it will be possible to non-invasively
    capture the species-specific abundance of shrimp in the challenging of environment
    of a highly aerated farm. In addition, algorithms will produce improved estimates
    of abundance, size, growth and behavioral abnormalities to the end user and informing
    go/no-go decisions as well as reducing sunk costs associated with uncertainty-based
    inefficiencies. Making \"big data\" available to the farmer, the buyers, as well
    as the scientific community. The controlled setting aquaculture provides for research
    is an untapped resource because the data are not standardized across ponds, regions
    or countries. The development of the proposed technology would be key in disseminating
    important research to the public via peer-reviewed publications on sensor optimization,
    animal growth, production, behavior and disease. Though the scope of this research
    and this product focuses on the shrimp sector, the model can be extended to other
    cultured species and applications (i.e., salmon and tilapia).\n\nThis award reflects

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project involves the evolution of wireless technologies for sensing, communication and control in modern laboratory and manufacturing processes.  pH is a fundamental measurement in numerous processes and this project will bring the technology involved in creating a wireless pH sensing stir bar to the prototype stage, ready to be transitioned to manufacturing. It will also provide the technological foundation to develop wireless sensing capabilities that will fundamentally change the measurement paradigm in the wet laboratory. Wireless sensing and communication will allow for in situ measurements that have not been previously convenient or even possible as well as remote monitoring and control. This will increase quality, safety, productivity, and convenience in both laboratory and manufacturing environments. Scientists and technicians will benefit from easier processes and data acquisition. Companies will benefit from increased quality assurance and yield cost savings. Consumers will benefit from better quality control of staples such as food, water, pharmaceuticals and medical devices.

    The proposed project will develop a wireless pH and temperature sensing magnetic stir bar that will communicate wirelessly with a base chemical workstation. The goal of the project is to produce a prototype pH sensing stir bar that is ready to be transitioned to manufacturing. A completely submersible pH sensor is not available on the market and will provide unparalleled convenience. The technical hurdles involve developing and incorporating the sensor and reference electrode portions of the stir bar, designing an electronic circuit that can sense in a high rf field used for communication and power, and sealing all components in a completely submersible form factor. Custom sensing and reference electrodes will be evaluated and tested independently. Circuits will be designed and shielding options will be investigated. Sealing methods will be evaluated to protect the system from harsh environments.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project is to enhance the well-being of babies and the quality of life of their caregivers and/or parents. Each week more than 2.5 million members of "Generation Alpha" are born globally to parents who expect and require technology driven feedback and support. Currently, this is not available in the area of sleep-time clothing choices, and so the ambiguous burden of these "art"-based decisions bears heavily on the minds of new parents. Medical bodies warn about limited capacity for infants to thermoregulate and the link between overheating and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). Under-dressing is also problematic and can result in serious infant hypothermia. Caregivers are educated that they must dress babies optimally, as over or under-dressing babies can lead to significant problems, but they are not armed with any technologies to do so. We will develop a system of advanced technologies to scientifically guide and quantify the right sleep-time choices, leading to optimal conditions for safe, regenerative and developmental growth, while alleviating the burden of doubt from the caregiver. Uniquely, we will couple advanced technologies with an engaging education platform to deliver a highly impactful product, designed to immediately capture a sizable portion of the rapidly growing $23 billion USA baby care industry.

    The proposed project will develop advanced technologies capable of determining the thermal resistance of baby sleep clothes and sleep-sacks, and evaluating suitability with respect to the measured conditions of the sleep environment. Developed technologies will be deployed at the consumer level, in-home. Current technologies for measuring the thermal resistance of fabrics are prohibitively expensive, time consuming and laboratory based. Rapidly and robustly approximating to this technology for in-home and portable deployment is extremely complex. Research objectives include exploring and developing a variety of novel ways to characterize the physical properties of fabrics as they relate to thermal resistance, using complementary sensor-based suites to create new technologies, and creating powerful multifaceted algorithms that synergistically combine inputs and make deterministic conclusions. Results will be comparatively analyzed and the user will be provided with guidance to assist their choices through a graphical interface that also provides other state-of-the-art sleep-time education information, reaffirming best practices, right where they are vitally needed, at the point of sleep-time.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to help manage and prevent non-communicable chronic diseases by developing a passive health and wellness monitoring system for personalized dietary recommendations, early disease diagnosis, and remote patient monitoring. According to the 2019 Global Burden of Disease Update, suboptimal dietary intake is responsible for more than 1 out of every 5 deaths globally, making it the greatest preventable disease risk factor. Decades of research have shown that tracking nutritional intake can lead to better awareness of dietary intake patterns and improve nutritional health. Yet diet-tracking mobile apps, despite their popularity, are inaccurate and overly burdensome and thus often lead to quitting. In addition, waiting for health complications to develop before diagnosing most chronic diseases reduces healthspans and leads to more costly healthcare interventions. There is a societal need for a passive nutrition and health-monitoring device for helping individuals recognize patterns of malnutrition on a routine basis for guiding lifelong behavior change and identifying biomarkers of disease early. This platform technology will reduce morbidity and mortality associated with most major chronic diseases, decrease healthcare costs, and reduce lost productivity.

    The proposed project will address the feasibility of integrating a wireless, electrochemical biosensor testing platform into a toilet for passive urinalysis testing. Better preventative healthcare requires individuals to monitor health and wellbeing routinely, long before clinical problems arise. Yet getting individuals to perform consistent, routine diagnostic evaluations is exceedingly difficult. The most effective route for routine monitoring of health data is through pervasive testing where the individual?s burden is as nonexistent as possible. There is a clinical and commercial opportunity for ubiquitous, passive, and routine home urine testing using an internet-connected smart-toilet equipped with biosensors for accurate urine-testing. Key technical hurdles include the development of a system capable of reliable urine collection and dilution normalization, contamination accounting, the development of a robust mechatronic sub-assembly for passively retrieving, translating, testing, and storing disposable electrochemical biosensors, biometric user identification, and integration of wireless data transfer capabilities with smart power management. Error rates associated with false test cycle starts, faulty biosensor manipulation, dilution and contamination accounting, and false user identification will be quantified, and the electrochemical biosensors? in situ test results will be compared against benchtop equivalents.?

    Phase I project addresses the clinical needs for tissue approximation and closure
    of large gastrointestinal defects in endoscopic surgery through the development
    of a novel image-guided full-thickness suturing device that is simple and easy
    to use while cost-effective. Full-thickness gastrointestinal defects such as perforation,
    anastomotic leak, and fistula are severe conditions caused by various types of
    pathologies. They are more likely to require intensive care and a long hospital
    stay and have high rates of morbidity and mortality. Managing gastrointestinal
    defects endoscopically has obvious advantages over surgical intervention, including
    shorter hospital stays, reduced post procedure pain, faster recovery, and reduced
    total cost of care. \n\nThe proposed project, if successful, will lead to demonstrating
    the feasibility of a novel, low cost, image-guided suturing device that is simple
    and intuitive to use. Currently, no good solutions exist for tissue approximation
    and closure of large gastrointestinal (GI) defects. Endoscopic clips are only
    effective for mucosa closure and small size defects and the only endoscopic suturing
    device on the market is very cumbersome, difficult to use, and its high cost often
    precludes usage. The technical innovation of the proposed device comprises a circular
    needle and a novel needle drive mechanism which allows for a simplified suturing
    technique. The device is single use, disposable, and an attachment to an endoscope
    (such as colonoscope, gastroscope). The technical goals of this project focus
    on developing and building a proof of concept prototype which includes custom
    needle and needle drive mechanism, suture anchors, and suture exchange mechanism;
    testing the prototype in a gastric model; proving the simplicity of this novel
    suturing technique through a physician feedback study; and validating the viability
    and scalability of design features for a commercialized product at a low cost.\n\nThis

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is a shift towards both accuracy and affordability
    within the world of energy sub-metering.  This metering system will have a dramatic
    impact on the market for submetering commercial real estate. By drastically reducing
    the cost and knowledge hurdles associated with accurate submetering and bringing
    the costs of submetering in line with value, this technology opens the door for
    a mass-market approach to circuit-level energy use data. The market for this commercial
    submetering is expected to reach $2.5 billion annually within six years, but could
    grow substantially larger with the introduction of low-cost, high-accuracy technologies.
    Additionally, it is estimated that access to metering data alone can reduce energy
    consumption within a building between 5% and 15%, meaning a wide deployment of
    these technologies could have wide-reaching environmental and energy security
    benefits.  \n\nThe proposed project will advance the state-of-the-art in true
    power metering by providing revenue quality AC power submetering using an energy-harvesting,
    as opposed to plug-in, design. Doing so requires fundamental improvements in circuit
    design, embedded software architecture and signal analysis. The result is a self-contained
    system that drastically reduces deployment and installation costs. This project
    will simplify the system implementation and reduce the cost of production, and
    the ability for Triumvi meters to share data and, more importantly, energy harvested.
    Specific key technical objectives include creating a daisy-chain framework through
    which individual nodes within a metering system can share energy and data, improving
    accuracy in the myriad of potential field conditions, and creating a system of
    runtime-diagnostics to identify, and fix, human error in real time. Study and
    pursuit of these objectives will take place both in the lab, as well is in the
    field, where installation and accuracy can be benchmarked against conventional
    hardwired metering solutions.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and

    The broader market impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to foster the mainstream use of decentralized database solutions in place of centrally owned and operated data centers and cloud services offered by companies like Amazon, Google and Facebook. Data security breaches involving tens or hundreds of millions of customers are now commonplace, as are high-profile news stories related to questionable uses of customer-supplied data.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to solve the key problem of developing a new network protocol that allows for a low-latency, secure, persistent and highly-available, decentralized No-SQL database which may operate at Internet scale. Key objectives include: development of a novel P2P overlay network which combines a zero-hop Distributed Hash Table (DHT) as a base routing layer and any number of traditional Kademlia DHTs as application specific leaf networks, all of which may communicate through a variety of transport protocols; constructing a new proof-of-space for use  both as the consensus layer of a proof-of-space blockchain and as a proof-of-capacity for storage nodes; creating a secure Decentralized Storage Network utilizing a proof of replication based on verifiable delay functions; and implementing and testing the protocol across common host devices and client runtimes. The end goal of the project is to validate the technical feasibility, scalability, and market interest for the subspace protocol.

    Transfer (STTR) project will be a low-cost, high-performance nanofiltration membrane
    technology for removing oils, pollutants, and organic materials from highly contaminated
    wastewater. Industrial activity in the U.S. produces more than 25 billion gallons
    of wastewater every day, much of contaminated with oils, greases, solvents, and
    other harmful chemical compounds. Existing filtration membranes are easily clogged
    and damaged by these oily materials, suffering a rapid decline in performance.
    Safely processing this wastewater by conventional means costs U.S. industrial
    facilities more than $40B per year. A breakthrough in nanofiltration technology
    will allow industries across the country - such as food processors, landfills,
    power plants, and paper mills - to easily and affordably clean their wastewater.
    \n\nThis STTR Phase I project proposes to develop the technology and processes
    to produce commercial-scale anti-fouling nanofiltration membranes for use with
    highly contaminated industrial wastewater. The project will combine large-scale
    manufacturing techniques such as high-precision spray coating with a novel chemistry
    platform based on zwitterionic copolymers to produce high-performance, low-cost
    membranes. These polymers exhibit extraordinary resistance to organic fouling
    as well as pore self-assembly at the nanometer scale. To achieve the required
    performance, the project will develop the process and materials to achieve a thickness
    of less than one micron in the selective layer of a thin-film composite. Currently,
    layers of this thickness are only achievable using in-situ polymerization of nylon-based
    polymers, which are costly, have low permeability, and are intolerant of oxidizing
    conditions. This project will overcome these limitations by exploiting the unique
    self-assembly behavior of zwitterionic copolymers to achieve ultrathin, uniformly
    porous films in both flat sheet and hollow fiber forms. The project will furthermore
    demonstrate the chemical robustness of these membranes with accelerated lifecycle
    testing relevant to industrial conditions. Commercial-scale production of self-assembling
    polymer membranes will represent a significant breakthrough for materials in this
    class.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to place the power of genetic identification in the hands of those who need it, at the front lines of conservation. The DNA Barcode Scanner will enable anyone, anywhere, to perform a low-cost, rapid, automated DNA test to validate the identity of a tissue sample, without specialized training, expensive lab-based equipment, reagents, or reliable power, where it is needed most - in the field. This technological advance has the potential to revolutionize species identification to prevent species extinction, to protect consumers and our food supply, and to combat threats to global biodiversity. The innovation's commercial potential includes improving the safety and sustainability of our supply chains, combatting costly environmental fraud, and detecting pests and pathogens that threaten our nation's economy, security, and health. The initial market opportunity is to address unmet demand from seafood suppliers, distributors, and retailers; government regulators and enforcement agents; and conservation and natural resources entities, for increased transparency and integrity of seafood supply chains by ending seafood mislabeling and fraud, which occurs in over 30% the $17.1 billion dollar U.S. seafood market and is worth up to $250,000 per illegal import.

    The proposed project will develop the customizable DNA collection, extraction, and amplification cartridge that enables a user to go from tissue sample to species identification in a single device. This project focuses on the scientific and technical challenge of automating sample preparation. The company's goal is to create an integrated device that will validate seafood products (our first market) from sample collection to DNA extraction, DNA amplification, and, ultimately, species identification. The goals of this project are to 1) determine a reliable and intuitive method for collecting DNA from a seafood product and create a prototype collection tool, 2) prototype an easy-to-use and highly flexible DNA extraction and sample preparation component to provide DNA suitable for analysis, and 3) fully integrate microfluidic processes and molecular chemistry (DNA amplification and analysis) with clear validation of multiple species. They will design and test several prototypes of the collection, extraction, and amplification cartridge and test these with users to identify the most robust and simplest method for delivering confident species identification. Their objective is to deliver a fully functional prototype that is intuitive for users and can perform a seafood species validation test in multiple field environments.

    This STTR Phase I project aims to pioneer a novel approach for the sustained delivery of peptide therapeutics using nano-composite microparticles. Peptide therapeutics tend to suffer from rapid enzymatic degradation and clearance, with half-lives on the order of minutes, and require frequent injections. The goal of a sustained release formulation is to reduce the frequency of injections by slowly releasing the therapeutic over a period of weeks to months. This will result in improved patient compliance and quality of life. Patient non-compliance is an economic burden that is estimated to cost the healthcare system over $100 billion/year. The lack of commercial success of existing sustained release technologies is due to low loading efficiencies, lack of controlled release at higher loading, and complex manufacturing. These limitations can be overcome with the newly-developed inverse Flash NanoPrecipitation (iFNP) process to produce nano-composite microparticles. This project aims to develop and test a once-monthly injectable formulation of a peptide therapeutic for type 2 diabetes that is currently injected daily. This research will aid in the understanding of the fundamental materials science and engineering principles that control therapeutic release from nano-composite microparticles. The rules for controlling release will apply broadly to other peptides, and this research will help to more rapidly develop future long-acting formulations.

    Current methods to produce peptide-loaded microparticles suffer from low drug loadings and poor encapsulation efficiencies, two of the most important factors for commercial viability. In contrast to existing methods, the iFNP technology allows for the assembly of nanoparticles with peptide loadings greater than 50wt% and encapsulation efficiencies greater than 90% in a fully scalable process. The nanoparticles are then assembled into microparticles to create the final sustained release formulation. Each drug-containing pore inside the microparticle is surrounded by a dense hydrophobic polymer layer which allows for therapeutic loadings 10x higher than competing technologies. The iFNP process has been demonstrated on a number of proof-of-concept molecules. In this project, iFNP will be used to produce a formulation of a peptide for diabetes therapy with a month-long release profile. The first goal of this project is to develop an understanding of the physical parameters that control the peptide stability and release. Supporting this goal, the peptide will be formulated with polymers of varying glass transition temperatures and degradation rates, and the release profiles will be measured in vitro. The efficacy of the optimal in vitro formulation will then be tested in a rat model. These studies are an important step in developing a commercial product that can positively impact patient care.

    Research (SBIR) project is to improve the current spraying practices in agriculture.
    Inefficient crop spraying causes drift which can lead to crop damage or unwanted
    pesticide use in neighboring non-target crop areas. It may contaminate nearby
    bodies of water or be an issue for human health.  Our company would solve this
    through the implementation of a closed loop sensor system which would remotely
    determine the efficiency of sprayer machines and the spray pattern of the material
    continuously and in real time. Farmers will benefit through reduced costs of wasted
    materials resulting from over-spraying, while feeling safe against pest and fungus
    infestation resulting from under-spraying. The initial intended customers are
    large orchards, vineyards and tree farms. Those farmers generally use airblast
    sprayers which are highly inefficient and waste about 45% of the material. Those
    chemicals either hit the ground and contaminate it or pollute the air.  An owner
    of a large farm that implements our proposed device will save a significant amount
    on chemical costs and also avoids the consequences due to drift of chemicals onto
    neighboring farms, public roads, or non-agricultural areas. \n\nThis SBIR Phase
    I project proposes to introduce a new technology to the agricultural sector. This
    technology has been previously built for complex and sophisticated applications
    in mostly academia and government sectors. We look to provide a new functionality
    while reducing the size and cost of the technology. It would be used as a new
    and improved method of calibration, replacing a tedious and often ignored current
    process. Furthermore, the sensor would be integrated as a closed loop system for
    autonomous sprayer adjustments. A complete software solution would accompany the
    hardware in order to make it approachable to the non-scientific community. This
    project will prove the potential of our technology as a competitive player in
    the rapidly growing ag-tech field.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is increased revenue and processing potential for scrap recyclers in the US. The artificially-intelligent algorithm designed in this project will enable domestic scrap processors to become more competitive within the material supply chain by giving them the ability to adapt, in real-time, to an ever-changing material consumption climate. With unstable international commodity trade, US scrap processors must reduce reliance on exporting low-value scrap to maintain profitable business models. Additionally, US scrap must exercise optimal processing schedules to prevent scrap surplus domestically while providing consumers with recycled products that are functionally equivalent to new products. The latter offers an environmentally-friendly scrap-to-product option that reduces the energy required for production and the amount of harmful CO2 released. Aluminum scrap recycling has been practiced for decades; however, the majority of post-consumer scrap is downcycled leaving revenue and environmental benefits untapped. Non-ferrous auto-shred was, on average, sold for $0.33/lb. less than its actual value in 2017, which equates to nearly $1 billion in opportunity cost. Artificially intelligent sorting systems will enable scrap processors to reach higher profit margins and meet environmental goals.

    The proposed project will completely automate scrap sortation. The advent of multi-sort capability encourages the need for preliminary research to identify how to operate sensor-based sorters optimally. Artificial intelligence can meet this need. The intellectual merit of this project is the development of an artificially-intelligent algorithm that is capable of optimizing scrap sortation in real-time. The research objectives include:&#8239;(1) identify all data sources in the scrap recycling process that &#8239;can &#8239;influence intelligent decision making (2)&#8239;design a database to host identified data sources such as compositional, market, inventory, and sales data and (3) design a customized artificially-intelligent algorithm for the&#8239; scrap &#8239;recycling industry to develop sorting criteria in real-time. To meet these objectives, a dynamic material flow model will be designed to analyze and host all relevant sensor, market, and experimental data streams to minimize data pre-processing requirements. Concurrently, aluminum scrap will be characterized to investigate how frequently and to what degree composition fluctuates. The database that hosts all supportive data streams will be designed to store and integrate all relevant data streams seamlessly. Finally, using an 80/20 training/testing data split with 5-fold cross-validation, the machine learning algorithm will be selected and optimized to provide the lowest error rate for suggested sorting criteria.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to increase yields and save irrigation water and costs for farmers of perennial crops and high intensity annual crops.  In order to maximize yields while simultaneously minimizing irrigation water usage, farmers need to understand, predict, and manage plant water stress, which is the yield reducing stress plants undergo when they struggle to draw water from the soil.  If successful, this project will demonstrate to farmers that low-cost measurement and forecasting of plant water stress is possible, and that Machine Learning (ML)-based recommendations for irrigation scheduling reduce water and energy usage, eliminate plant water stress, and increase crop yields.  Research and Development activities completed will enhance the understanding of the relationship of plant water stress to microenvironmental conditions and how plant water stress and microenvironmental conditions can be accurately measured and forecast with low cost sensing capabilities.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to perform research and development to validate the concept of a low-cost synthetic sensor for plant water stress.  The objective of this project is to field test the low-cost sensor arrays, compare the output to data from high-cost scientific grade sensors, and utilize the data gathered during the field test to train ML models. These ML models will perform sensor fusion on the data from the low-cost sensor arrays and output a plant water stress measurement.  These ML models can then forecast future plant water stress, which will be compared to actual field measurements for accuracy assessment and refinement.  Once refined, the ML models will determine the minimal amount of irrigation water necessary to mitigate the predicted plant water stress.  This optimized amount of irrigation water will be allocated into a recommend irrigation schedule for farmers to review and implement.  The relevance and ease of use of the recommended irrigation schedule will then be assessed by farmers.

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase I project involves the creation of particles that
    will allow one to see a map of temperature within a Magnetic Resonance Imaging
    (MRI) measurement.  This is a significant advancement because conventional thermometry
    is usually invasive, allows only single point temperature measurements, and may
    interfere with the therapeutic and imaging instrument. The proposed technology
    is designed to be biocompatible and minimally invasive, leading to fast 3D temperature
    mapping deep in the human body. The proposed materials and techniques can be used
    with MRI-guided thermal procedures which can replace scalpel-based surgery for
    a variety of cancers, improving patient outcomes and reducing surgical time. The
    method can also be used to improve treatments for essential tremor, uterine fibrosis
    and arteriovenous malformation. In these treatments, the temperature in the entire
    affected region must be constantly monitored. Due to the limitations of the currently
    used temperature measurement methods, these minimally invasive MRI-guided procedures
    are not frequently used or take considerably longer time than desired because
    surgeons often must work around failed temperature measurements. The work in this
    proposal could transform current methods of MRI-guided thermometry, significantly
    reducing surgery time and cost as well as improving patient outcomes.  \n\nThis
    proposal develops a novel, minimally-invasive method of creating temperature maps
    superimposed on anatomical MRI images. The technology uses a new type of temperature-sensitive
    sensor, in the form of magnetic nanoparticles, and could ultimately be used within
    human or other tissues.  The key idea is that magnetic particles embedded in tissue
    will create a local dipole magnetic field that will modulate (statically or dynamically)
    the homogeneity of the main static magnetic field of the MRI scanner.  This changes
    the nuclear relaxation times of the tissue and broadens the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
    (NMR) linewidth, ultimately leading to local changes in the brightness of the
    MRI image.  The magnetization of the particles is engineered to change with temperature,
    and therefore the results are temperature dependent. Different shades of gray
    in the weighted gradient echo MR images, can then be calibrated to obtain a spatial
    map of temperature. This has immediate application in providing real-time temperature
    information to the surgeon during MRI-guided thermal interventional procedures
    to treat cancer, for example. These new contrast sensors can operate in a wide
    temperature range both below and above the human body temperature, producing spatial
    maps of temperature with an accuracy better than 1 degree Celsius.\n\nThis award

    This SBIR Phase I project is developing a breakthrough technology to non-invasively monitor fetal oxygen levels in utero, to enable the more accurately detection of fetuses in distress and facilitate safer births for mothers and babies. Currently, obstetricians struggle with a 50-year old monitoring technology, which reports fetal heart rate and maternal contractions, and that is associated with an 89% false positive rate for detecting babies in distress. This is a major contributor to high cesarean section rates worldwide and up to 40% in some US hospitals. Because of the costs, risks for mothers and negative implications for babies' health, C-section rates are coming under scrutiny from insurers and accreditors, however, clinicians lack the means to accurately identify oxygenation starvation and, to date, no non-invasive means of directly measuring fetal oxygenation has been developed. Raydiant's system builds off traditional pulse oximetry and will employ safe levels of light, through the mother's abdomen, to monitor fetal pulse and report oxygen saturation, the crucial, but missing diagnostic. This technology will be applicable to over 2.9 million births per year in the US as an enhancement to traditional monitoring whenever a heart rate signal of concern is observed. Both the absolute oxygenation value and its trend over time will enable more informed decision making throughout the birth process.

    This project pushes the fundamental boundaries of pulse oximetry and bio-photonics. Unlike traditional finger pulse oximetry, sensing non-invasively through the maternal abdomen presents a body in a body problem, where the fetal pulse signal is orders of magnitude weaker than and intertwined with the maternal. Photons are scattered and absorbed by multiple tissue layers and there are tradeoffs between signal strength, noise and the ratio of fetal to maternal signal. Non-homogeneities from subject to subject makes calibration difficult. Addressing these challenges will require innovation in photonics hardware and signal processing and this proposal has a three specific aims: the development of a specific sensor hardware architecture that will facilitate detection of the fetal signal; development of Raydiant's algorithm to separate fetal from maternal signal, reject noise and report saturation; and validation of the combined system in a pregnant animal model, where fetal oxygenation levels are actively controlled and compared to the device reading. This proposal encompasses developing a second generation prototype system and represents critical technology de-risking aiming towards a commercial system for integration with current monitoring technology and clinical practice.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to boost the power output of solar cells by
    5-6% and reduce manufacturing costs by ~5%. By commercializing the proposed effectively
    transparent contact (ETC) technology the levelized costs of electricity (LCOE)
    of solar energy systems could be dramatically reduced, resulting in accelerated
    adoption of solar energy to address greenhouse gas emission and to become independent
    of fossil fuels. Improving power output of solar cells is one of the most effective
    means to drive down LCOE, and the ETC technology is broadly applicable to improve
    the power output of nearly all types of solar cells. Lower-cost solar cells can
    also be expected to benefit the developing world as well as disadvantaged communities
    that lack access to the power grid. In the near term, the proposed ETC technology
    will unlock higher power output and new applications for III-V photovoltaics,
    which are used predominantly in aerospace, defense, high performance consumer
    electronics and automotive. These rapidly growing markets require higher power
    output solar cells to add functionality (RADAR, LIDAR and surveillance) by increasing
    the payload capacity that is currently limited by the available space to mount
    the solar cells. \n\nThe proposed project will demonstrate the commercial viability
    of the ETC technology by demonstrating a new world record solar cell and scalable
    fabrication on commercial III-V solar cells. Metal contacts are required for charge
    extraction from solar cells, typically covering 5-6% of the front surface and
    blocking sunlight from reaching the photovoltaic material below. These losses
    due to blocking of incoming sunlight by the metal contacts are the largest single
    contribution to the performance loss in most solar cells. The proposed ETC technology
    eliminates these losses and thereby boost the solar cell power output by 5-6%.
    The ETC technology has been demonstrated at lab scale and is world's highest performing
    front contact technology. During the research project, ETCs will be integrated
    with commercial III-V solar cells supplied by prospective initial customers and
    world-leading research partners. The technical viability of ETCs will be established
    by achieving dramatic improvements in cell efficiency for each cell type, whereas
    the commercial viability will be established by successfully integrating the ETCs
    using techniques, materials, and tools suitable for commercial scale-up. Completion
    of these objectives will accelerate the efforts to commercialize the ETC technology,
    which will broadly increase power output and reduce cost of solar energy.\n\nThis

    This SBIR Phase I project will further the development of an orally administered gene delivery vehicle called the Crypt-Reaching Particle (CRP) that is able to overcome the physical barriers of the mucus to deliver DNA-based drugs to the cells of the gastrointestinal tract. The therapeutic agent will then be expressed as a protein locally in the gastrointestinal tract or be secreted into the bloodstream to treat the full body. Development of this vehicle will lead to novel scientific insights on DNA delivery that will benefit and educate the field of fundamental science and engineering. Successful commercialization would benefit pharmaceutical companies by providing an oral drug delivery platform for approved and novel drugs, U.S. patients by reducing the need for injectable drugs and thereby increasing compliance and quality of life, and payers by reducing costs associated with injectable drugs and improving outcomes by increasing patient compliance via oral administration. The drug-agnostic feature provides broad and diverse market opportunities within the rapidly expanding market for biologics, among other therapeutic agents leading to substantial job creation. As an example, a potential addressable market in four areas (i.e., delivering TNF inhibitors, protein replacement, peptide hormones, and blood factors) exceeds $90 billion per year.

    This project is designed to prepare a stable oral formulation of the Crypt-Reaching Particle (CRP), a novel drug-agnostic drug delivery vehicle, and demonstrate that it can deliver a functional DNA cargo for expression and secretion in intestinal epithelial cells in vitro and in vivo. This project focuses on the technical challenges associated with preserving the functionality of a DNA cargo as an example of a challenging drug delivery scenario that is difficult to replicate. The innovation is the design of the vehicle to penetrate through the mucus and transfect underlying epithelial cells by mimicking the enteric poliovirus. This will lay the foundation for the first oral gene therapy. Briefly, the project will address three objectives. First, preparation of a formulation for the CRP for oral administration via lyophilization with analyses to assess formulation and DNA stability as a function of time, temperature, and pH. Second, testing the ability of the orally formulated CRP to deliver a functional DNA plasmid encoding Gaussia luciferase to Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells in vitro by measuring both cellular and secreted expression. Finally, testing the ability of the orally formulated and administered CRP to deliver a functional Gaussia luciferase plasmid to intestinal epithelial cells in vivo in Fischer 344 rats to assess expression and secretion.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is that it will reskill those being displaced by the disruption caused by the impending AI and automation that is sweeping every industry. By providing training and fully integrated career services platforms at significantly lower cost than traditional models, Expercoin Republics will make education more accessible to organizations seeking to upskill their employees and professionals looking to reskill. According to Harvard Business School professor Clayton Christensen, 50% of all American colleges are bound for bankruptcy in the next few decades. Due to the rapid pace of technological change and new employment requirements, we are moving away from credentialing to continuous learning. This project will allow organizations of all kinds to use its protocol to create expert networks and content platforms, while leveraging tokens to reward participation among their users.  400 to 800 million people globally need to be reskilled. This is estimated to translate to $8.5 trillion in unrealized revenue due to lack of talent by 2030.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to embrace a novel intellectual approach and business model that empowers employees and employers through upskilling, continuous learning, and skill verification. The mission of Expercoin Republics is to instantly allow anyone to create a specialized community with marketplaces for training, assessments, mentorship and work opportunities. Expercoin will use blockchain to create decentralized autonomous organizations that advance learning and facilitate employment through the creation of thousands of specialized learning communities. A notable achievement of Expercoin would be to create the underlying infrastructure that helps businesses and governments launch learning economies that consist of self-regulated decentralized entities with features such as transparent voting, effective governance, fraud adjudication, spam prevention, account verification and rewards. An Expercoin token will provide a wide range of functions necessary to create a decentralized economy that is not governed by any central authority.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project addresses the immediate need to develop advanced air conditioning technology that increases energy efficiency and will have a significant and positive impact on reducing Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions. As Room Air Conditioning (RAC) demand increases by an estimated 5x over the next 30 years, it is crucial that newly established scientific and technological approaches be developed which lessen the requirement of 'peaker' power plants to supply electricity for their operation. Nativus is engineering an energy-efficient 12,000 BTU Room Air Conditioner (RAC) for residential and light-commercial consumers, capable of cooling 500 ft2. Through a complete architectural redesign, our proprietary technology offers customers a solution to their air conditioning needs which is cheaper to operate, quieter, filters the air, and is easier to install than currently available commercial offerings.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a novel, rotating air conditioning design which combines the main components of an air conditioner into a single, packaged device to drastically increase air conditioner performance.  The roughly one billion air conditioners in operation globally operate at 5-10% of their theoretical ultimate Carnot efficiency, as industry focuses on "first-cost" and has not demonstrated meaningful, radical improvements since the inception of the air conditioner. The current state-of-the-art technology in the HVAC industry is based upon the 'fan plus finned-tube' (FPFT) Heat Exchanger in which a fan blows air across either hot or cold heat exchanger fins. This architecture results in the formation of an insulative 'boundary layer', severely degrading heat exchanger performance. Through the use of one high-efficiency motor, instead of two or three motors commonly found on state-of-the-art technology, our proprietary design rotationally-shears the boundary layer from the surface of the heat exchanger, thereby increasing efficiency while decreasing power consumption. Our research objectives include air conditioner component and system-level validation, supported by three milestones which include Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory (NRTL) performance validation, system reliability through prototype testing, and economic analysis.  The tasks involved in our project include design, manufacture, assemble, and testing of a complete system.

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase I project addresses the unacceptable incidence of
    orthopedic device-related infections, as well as the dangerous rise of antibiotic
    resistant bacteria. More than 100,000 implanted orthopedic fixation devices (pins,
    plates, and screws) acquire bacterial infections each year in the US, accounting
    for approximately $1.5 trillion in associated medical and surgical treatment costs.
    Furthermore, the overuse and misuse of antibiotics to treat these infections has
    led to a dramatic rise in antibiotic resistance, which poses a severe risk to
    human health. This project aims to develop and optimize a commercially viable
    process to impart orthopedic fixation devices with a unique surface nanotexture
    designed to inhibit bacterial attachment and disrupt the biofilm cycle while simultaneously
    stimulating robust implant integration with adjacent bone. Importantly, this treatment
    acts via topography alone and does not incorporate antimicrobial agents or pharmaceuticals.
    Due to the ubiquity and gravity of the infection epidemic, this first-of-its-kind
    antibacterial surface technology is expected to rapidly infiltrate the orthopedic
    device market and drive a dramatic market shift towards the development of products
    with enhanced biological activity. Ultimately, this project has the potential
    to alleviate significant clinical and economic burdens while stimulating technological
    advances in a competitive market. \n\nThe proposed work aims to create an antibacterial
    surface nanotexture by utilizing a proprietary modified atomic deposition technique.
    The fabrication parameters used during this deposition process are closely linked
    to the resulting surface characteristics (and thus its antimicrobial efficacy).
    However, the link between fabrication parameters and antimicrobial efficacy is
    inadequately understood currently. Therefore, the proposed work employs a systematic
    strategy to elucidate the relationships involved and establish control over the
    fabrication process and resulting surface properties. The project is separated
    into four stages, each designed to explore the effect of a specific fabrication
    parameter on performance outcomes, including bacterial colonization, bone cell
    functions, and trends in certain surface properties that often correlate with
    cell-substrate interactions (e.g. surface energy, roughness, skewness, etc.).
    The relationships revealed through testing will be used to build a set of equations
    that describe how the properties of the nanotextured surface vary as a function
    of the fabrication parameters. This set of equations will then be used to optimize
    the system, enabling consistent and controllable operation of the deposition process
    as manufacturing specifications evolve. In addition to advancing the development
    of a market-changing product, the proposed research will contribute to the growing
    understanding of cell and bacteria responses on nanostructured surfaces in an
    ongoing effort to mitigate infection associated with orthopedic implants.\n\nThis
    award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) project is the potential to deploy a powerful tool for carbon
    capture.  CO2-capture is the foundation of greenhouse gas mitigation.  The high
    cost of current processes for CO2-capture have prevented their widespread deployment.
    \ High-pressure, Density-driven Separator (HDS) technology efficiently and continuously
    captures CO2 from gas streams, including both flue gas and fuel gas.  An HDS module
    produces nearly Pure High-pressure CO2 (PH-CO2).  HDS technology has transformational
    operating expense enabled by innovative strategies for compression, expansion,
    energy recovery, and subsequent use of the dense and light fractions.  An HDS
    module has no moving parts, membranes, pressure swings or temperature swings.
    \ Therefore, HDS technology has the potential for very low capital expense.  These
    low costs allow access to financial markets.  Other revenue sources are also facilitated
    by low capture cost.  For instance, PH-CO2 is food grade, valued in excess of
    $100/ton.  PH-CO2 is suitable for enhanced oil recovery.  HDS technology separates
    CO2 from fuel gas, producing a valuable high-pressure vapor, in addition to PH-CO2.
    \ HDS technology dramatically reduces the CO2-capture cost and provides a purity
    that enables a profitable B2B model. \n\nThis STTR Phase I project proposes to
    develop HDS technology.  Quantitative metrics will be refined and employed to
    develop detailed capital expense and operating cost models.  Two technical hurdles
    must be overcome to reduce these costs.  These hurdles are also opportunities
    for innovation.  The first opportunity is to achieve sufficient volumetric efficiency
    in the pressure vessel for commercial deployment.  The equilibrium state inside
    the HDS module is perfect separation.  Increasing the rate of approach to that
    equilibrium state reduces the size and cost of the HDS module. This will be accomplished
    by exploiting the synergy between fluid state, surface state, fluid motion, and
    gravity.  This synergy coalesces CO2, allowing its rapid separation from the remaining
    components of flue gas and fuel gas.  The second opportunity is to achieve sufficient
    overall process efficiency for commercial deployment.  The power required for
    compression determines operating expense.  Our strategy involves operating the
    near-isothermal cold compression train and near-isothermal hot expansion train
    as a heat engine (an approximation of the Ericsson cycle).  In this manner, innovative
    gerotor compressors and expanders work together with heat exchangers using waste
    heat to reduce or eliminate operating costs.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory
    mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to commercially develop an in vitro (cell culture) platform to enhance the efficiency of drug discovery. Every drug delivered to a human engages the network of blood vessels for delivery to the target tissue or as part of the removal. An essential feature of the blood vessel network is an extensive network of small vessels surrounded by smooth muscle which can contract and dilate to control blood flow, and thus drug delivery. There are no in vitro human platforms that can mimic this biological function, despite the fact that cardiovascular toxicity is the leading cause of failure in clinical trials. As such, a pre-clinical tool to assess vascular toxicity would significantly impact the drug development process. Developing a successful drug averages 10-12 years and nearly $2.6 billion. Despite the fact that ~60% of the total development costs are spent on human clinical trials, fewer than 1 in 10 entering clinical trials will succeed. There is a significant opportunity to improve the accuracy of preclinical drug screening which, in turn, will generate dramatic cost savings and shorten time-to-market. The company's proposed vasoactive human vascular network represents a leap forward in technology to simulate the human response to new and existing drugs. Furthermore, the platform technology has broad future applications including the incorporation of tissue specific function (e.g, human tumor cells) and patient specificity which will further advance drug development and precision medicine.

    There are currently no in vitro platforms that can mimic vasoconstriction or vasorelaxation, processes which require vasoresponsive smooth muscle cells. Competing technologies line prefabricated tubes or membranes with endothelial cells to mimic the vasculature which will never be able to simulate vasoactivity. Since the company's platform is comprised of living dynamic microvessels, the company is uniquely positioned to create a platform with this functionality. The primary objective is to develop a 3D perfused human vascular network with smooth muscle providing the capacity to characterize vasoactive substances. The company will achieve the primary objective by completing two specific aims: 1) Incorporate human smooth muscle cells into a 3D in vitro vascular network; and 2) Quantify the dose-response of the 3D perfused vessel network to a panel of vasoactive drugs. Achieving vasoactive functionality in an in vitro vascular network will be the first demonstration of this critical biological phenomenon, and will meet an important commercial need in the pharmaceutical industry.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the advancement
    of battery technologies. The race for the perfect battery is intensifying due
    to growing global demand for both the electric vehicle (EV) and stationary storage
    industries. The search is on for new ways to improve energy and power density,
    reduce charging time, and extend battery life. The project will create a diagnostic
    tool that provides an unprecedented glimpse inside the battery and has the potential
    to accelerate scientific understanding of how batteries age. A more accurate assessment
    of battery degradation in real time can inform on-board algorithms, can improve
    overall battery pack efficiency, and has major cost saving impacts for automakers
    and stationary storage users. This predictability enables more cost-effective
    warranty management, improved charging and safety algorithms, and ever more efficient
    battery pack designs.  Having a sense of remaining useful life also enables the
    battery to be re-used in a secondary application - creating new business opportunities
    while a new revenue stream making batteries more sustainable.  Ultimately, this
    reduces costs for both consumers and manufacturers, and contributes to greener
    use of resources for society. \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
    Phase I project unlocks key insights for large-format lithium batteries. Today?s
    battery management systems (BMS) do not track a battery?s actual degradation metrics
    so it cannot forecast remaining useful life. This makes it hard to predict the
    ?cliff?, a sudden and steep drop in capacity near a battery?s end of life.  This
    forces battery makers to overdesign battery systems to reduce chances of premature
    failure before the warranty expiration. The proposed research employs electrochemical
    impedance spectroscopy (EIS) onboard a BMS.  EIS is a diagnostic tool that measures
    battery impedance - something only possible in a lab setting today. Tracking impedance
    unlocks a lifetime of degradation data and helps battery engineers better understand
    the long-term degradation behavior of high voltage battery packs. The project
    will focus on 1) minimizing the required hardware to measure impedance of each
    cell in a series-connected battery pack, and 2) reducing the down-time associated
    with the impedance measurement. The proposed innovation blends a unique hardware
    architecture with wide-bandgap semiconductors and adaptive charge-control algorithms
    to minimize hardware size. These help to reduce overall system cost and unlocks
    orders of magnitude improvement in hardware scalability over existing EIS methods.\n\nThis

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is as diverse as the laser technology itself.  Lasers have become the true facilitator of the data-based society.  It is tool of choice for future smart factories and on-demand manufacturing.  It serves as the fundamental building block of optical sensing systems used to collect large volumes of critical data to be used for decision making in every facet of society.  The myriad of new applications for laser systems echoes the same demand ? higher power.  The bottleneck in the power generation is often the capability of optical components of the laser to withstand the power without degradation.  So the greater potential of lasers can be unleashed if there would be a way to break through the power handling capability of laser components starting with the nonlinear optical crystals indispensable in creating these powerful energy sources.  This research project is precisely designed to address this need and the successful completion of this project would enable the next generation of miniaturized electronic devices, expand our horizon of biological imagery and precision surgery, and explore our universe with instruments that are currently confined to our laboratories.

    The proposed project targets the most common material used to generate high power visible and UV light ? Lithium Triborate (LBO) crystal.  Able to handle power density up to 45GW/cm2, LBO is currently the material of choice for high energy industrial lasers.  However, optical surfaces where the light enter and exit LBO often get damaged well before the actual bulk material.  Traditional dielectric anti-reflective (AR)  coatings on these surfaces are typically made using a limited selection of materials of lower damage threshold in a process highly susceptible to contamination, resulting in significantly lower damage threshold than the bulk LBO crystal.  In this proposal, state-of-the-art surface-texturing processes on LBO will be developed to eliminate the use of these dielectric films while still providing the necessary AR functionality.  A variety of processes and materials on LBO surfaces will be attempted and studied with resulting surfaces tested for absorption and damage threshold.

    Research (SBIR) project is the development and widespread adaptation of next generation
    energy storage devices. With high energy density advanced materials, these devices
    can store significantly higher electric power per single charge. Particularly,
    rechargeable batteries with significantly higher energy density will improve;
    the range of electric vehicles on a single charge, operating time of defense platforms

    production of novel, pure graphene anode material by Chemical Vapor Deposition
    technique using readily available material resources. Currently, graphite anode-based
    LIBs are the most commonly used and the most reliable energy storage devices for
    portable electronics, electric vehicles and electric grid storage due to their
    stability, low cost, and safety. However, graphite's low capacity (theoretically,
    372 mAh/g) prohibits the development of higher energy density batteries. The problem
    is that graphite's internal structure limits lithium diffusion within interlayer
    spaces. We propose to replace graphite as the anode material. Our material is
    a newly-discovered high-quality graphene network, consisting of incommensurately-stacked
    multilayer graphene (IMLG) assembled in three-dimensional (3D) form. It exhibits
    unique structural and electrical properties that enable the reversible intercalation
    of large amounts of lithium within interlayer spaces of multilayer graphene. IMLG
    anode exhibits an extremely high reversible capacity of up to 1500 mAh/g tested

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is mainly
    in the area of machine condition monitoring. Vibration monitoring is an integral
    part of any machine condition monitoring regimen. All equipment that comprise
    belts, gears, bearings, drive motors, or other moving components have a specific
    vibration signature during normal operating cycles. Change in equipment vibration
    serves as an early warning of a decline in operating condition and signals the
    need for preventative maintenance to avoid more serious equipment faults and failure.
    \ Due to extremely small form-factor and wireless signal detection scheme of the
    sensing tag in the proposed vibration monitoring system of this project, simple
    and cost-effective direct measurement of vibration from hard-to-access parts of
    machinery (e.g. rotor in an electric motor) is enabled. This will have a significant
    impact on widespread use of such vibration monitoring techniques, hence improving

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project arises from bringing new materials to market for making improved rechargeable lithium ion batteries needed by the high-tech economy, medicine, and the military (batteries are the second largest military consumable). In today's world, everything, including medical devices (e.g., wireless implants and sensors), has an app; using apps requires batteries. This project will produce "Safer Energy for the Wireless World"; the resulting improved batteries will incorporate novel, lighter, and safer (no overheating) anode materials that will charge faster and store more energy than current versions. The new anode materials are estimated upon success to yield sales of $1B during the first 10 years from selling the materials to battery manufacturers to incorporate, initially, as composites in lithium ion battery anodes, and, later, as the entire active anode. Broader societal impacts include greater safety because the batteries do not overheat; lighter, more portable devices with longer battery life and faster recharging time; reduced need for backup batteries; and diverse STEM workforce development though applied research and entrepreneurship training.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop safer, more powerful ways to charge electronic devices by translating fundamental research from university to industry. The opportunity arises from an NSF-supported discovery of the first solid form of carbon monoxide known, a two-dimensional crystal structure: graphene monoxide (GmO). GmO and its first proposed application for anodes in lithium ion batteries are patented. Knowledge gaps to be addressed include identifying tailored materials for optimizing batteries for electronics, using theoretical and experimental approaches to identify the maximum energy storage capacity for lithium batteries, and determining the energy and power densities and safety properties under normal and extreme operating conditions. The technology must be demonstrated in 200-mAh pouch batteries, the first milestone needed for battery manufacturers to consider adopting the innovation through licensing or sales. The second milestone is to scale up materials to produce large quantities. The overall goal is to commercialize the GmO material into an active anode or additive material for extreme batteries. In sum, the project will yield prototype batteries made from the new materials, optimize properties for specific partner applications, simulate interactions between GmO and Li, and identify pathways for scaleup of materials production.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the development of drone-based technology to manage fires more safely, efficiently, and effectively.  Wildfires cause hundreds of billions of dollars in annual damages in the United States. As the size and number of wildfires increases, prescribed fires have emerged as one of the most cost-effective tools to reduce catastrophic damage by removing excess fuel for wildfires and controlling their evolution. Yet, to be most effective, prescribed fires require putting people in the proximity of fire and are often limited by the unavailability (due to cost or demand) of fast delivery mechanisms such as those provided by helicopters. This effort will result in technology that directly addresses both pain points by improving the intelligence of drone-based fire monitoring and ignition systems. This project has the potential to shape how fire management is conducted in the future, making it safer for fire personnel and enabling cost-effective prescribed fire practices that can help society to control catastrophic wildfires and better manage landscapes.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will enable the development of drone-based technology that will transform fire management. Current drone-based ignition and monitoring systems have the potential to change the field but are hampered by their extensive reliance on human controllers. This lack of automation limits these systems? potential applicability, scale, effectiveness, and unnecessarily increases their risk. The proposed work aims to make monitoring and ignition more intelligent and scalable through: 1) specialized machine learning pipelines to characterize fire fronts and identify ground assets; 2) light-weight fire simulation engine that can provide short-horizon prediction of the fire front evolution while executing on limited computer power; and 3) distributed planning algorithms that adjust the drone's trajectory and sphere drop strategy to manipulate fire intensity while keeping ground assets, vehicles, and personnel safe. These challenges are especially difficult to address given the harsh fire environment, the weight and power constraints of commercial drones preferred for these activities, and the integration of two distinct domains, drone navigation and fire management.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Project (SBIR) project is the development of a platform for pathogen identification and other genomic applications that achieves rapid, sensitive, multiplexed single-molecule detection.  The genomic diagnostics market is poised to grow to $40 billion by 2021.  The goal of this platform will be to offer multiplexed detection of more than 1,000 pathogens, allowing accurate point-of-care diagnosis of infectious diseases.  Other genomic applications that also are possible include assessment of the microbiome or monitoring opportunistic infections in pulmonary diseases.  In addition, the platform has the potential for use in genomic sequencing, a market that is expected to reach $9 billion by 2020.

    The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase I project is to develop a highly multiplexed, bioelectronic, label-free assay platform capable of real-time, label-free detection of thousands of nucleic acid targets without amplification. This will be accomplished  through the use of nanoscale single-molecule field-effect transistors (smFETs) on a complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) integrated-circuit platform, which fully leverages the economies of scale of modern semiconductor manufacturing. The initial target application for this technology is multiplexed pathogen identification at the point-of-need. This project will bring the technology to wafer-scale manufacturing, which will both improve device quality and lower the per device cost of manufacture, and demonstrate proof-of-concept for genomic detection (without amplification) on clinical samples.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will be to bring to the market a faster and cheaper means of gathering highly accurate local air quality.  This will be done through the use of miniaturization of chemical sensors that are carried by UAVs.  Not only will there be technical hurdles that will be overcome through the implementation of this means of gathering data, the use of UAVs in this manner pushes the boundaries of their use in urban areas in a way that has not been done before.  The societal and commercial impact will be to reduce cost and time in obtaining air quality at a point in time and space, thereby making air quality measurements less of a financial and technical burden to governments, organizations and corporations.  This progress will help ensure that communities can address air quality concerns through the data gathered.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to implement a novel means to couple a low-cost technology to detect when chemical components reach a given threshold in the air with the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles as a means of delivering the sensors to a specified location.  The sensor technology utilizes colorimetric detection of chemicals.  Off-the-shelf colorimetric sensors, combined with a unique algorithm, produce color difference maps for toxic industrial chemicals at their permissible exposure level (PEL) concentrations.  The objective of the research is to determine if the proposed approach will allow for accurate chemical sensing for a precise location.  It is anticipated that the technology to be utilized will allow for an accurate capture of a broad range of pollutants and chemical compounds along with concentration levels.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is significant. Agriculture is one of the most important industries impacting the economy, society, and the environment. By automating harvesting of fresh produce, society's ability to grow healthy and sustainable food will increase substantially. The innovation will enhance scientific and technological understanding of how to deploy commercially viable multi-robot coordinated groups performing complex automated tasks, in agriculture and beyond. The long-term opportunity for agricultural robotics is $150B+. This innovation focuses on controlled-environment methods, which are more intensive in terms of capital and labor, but far less intensive in terms of water, chemical use, and fertilizer use. If robots can reduce manual labor of large-scale production, and enhance human management precision, it will enable intensive agriculture practices to compete with, and in some cases supplant, traditional chemical-, labor-, and water-intensive approaches. This will make the US a more competitive global producer of high-quality produce, increase food security, increase access to healthy food for all people, and protect natural resources and the environment.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will advance the fields of Robotic Applications, including computer vision/machine learning and robotics controls, by solving critical problems faced when operating in highly dynamic yet precise biological environments like farms. 1) By evolving and combining approaches from the forefront of computer vision, the project will improve environment sensing of e.g. clusters of fruit, their locations, conditions, precise locations of stems and obstacles. 2) Using that information, the project will develop innovative approaches to complex planning problems where leaves, stems, and obstacles interfere with optimal harvesting but are movable. This will be done with millimeter-level precision, where current autonomous planning approaches operate on multi-centimeter precision. 3) Lastly, the project will combine environmental data with 3D reconstructions of grow operations and individual fruit tracking in order to provide better sampling data to forecast production on a 1-4-week basis, and eventually build a deep learning model. This project is critical to achieving the commercial threshold of performance for robotic harvesting services, including high percent of berries picked, acceptable speed of picking, and the provision of climate sensing and forecast information.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of a cost-effective high-performance platform to monitor and characterize phytoplankton and other microorganisms in water. Some of these aquatic microorganisms may be toxic or even fatal resulting in significant public health concerns (such as recent "red tide" events in Florida, USA) and drastic economic consequences (i.e. deadly effects of harmful algal blooms on the aquaculture industry). The current state of the art in monitoring technology includes laborious and expensive manual sample collection and evaluation using a benchtop microscope or optical digital imaging system. In contrast, the proposed platform will be transformative by enabling low-cost, portable and fast monitoring and automated characterization of aquatic microorganisms. Therefore, this platform will revolutionize monitoring of aquatic microorganisms and, being low cost, it will enable a much wider application of the technology to other markets. Some of these future applications include more efficient biofuels research and development (via algae monitoring), marine biology science and education, general monitoring of particles and pathogens at the water treatment facilities, production algae monitoring. Therefore, the potential societal impact and commercial potential of the proposed technology is transformative.

    The proposed project aims to develop and evaluate a portable, rapid, durable and environmentally-stable imaging flow-cytometry technology that will automatically monitor microorganisms, such as phytoplankton and pathogens present in the flowing water, and will be capable of specific classification. Existing optics-based flow-cytometry solutions are expensive and not durable for field use. Unlike lab-based flow cytometers or hand-held assays, the proposed system will not rely on reagents or labeling, and therefore will not need an expert/professional, and will keep the evaluated water unchanged. Thus, it can be installed for continual unattended operation and will be much more cost-effective per test due to elimination of an expert's time, costly reagents and fluorophores. Furthermore, the proposed system will also be integrated with a machine learning engine capable of automated identification of microorganisms as well as other micro-objects of interest. Finally, the proposed system will be evaluated on pre-collected samples of local coastal ocean water to determine the presence of three example types of phytoplankton microorganisms and to provide statistical distribution of all of the detected micro-objects. Therefore, the proposed system will be transformative and provide an innovative and unique capability to expediently survey samples of water and automatically characterize identified micro objects.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to develop a safe, natural, long-lasting and effective mosquito repellent product by exploiting the natural repellent compounds present in the skin microbiome.  Mosquito-borne illnesses affect 700M people worldwide and cause several million deaths each year.  Chikungunya, West Nile, Malaria, Zika, Dengue, are just some of the debilitating vectors spread by mosquitoes. Mosquito-derived diseases cost >$6.8B/year and the market for mosquito repellents is >$3.2B and growing. Many solutions are aimed at killing and disabling mosquitoes, but mosquitoes are a crucial part of the ecological food chain. Further, many repellents are extremely toxic, and mosquitoes are developing resistance. The proposed technology will be used to identify compounds that will drive the endogenous skin microbiome to a more mosquito repellent phenotype. Using these methods, it is possible to harness the biochemistry contained in the native skin microbiome to create an endogenous repellency that is a safe, natural, environmentally friendly, and effective barrier to mosquitoes. It is expected that this repellency approach may be used safely even with children and pregnant women. In addition, it may be possible to use this approach to develop repellents for multiple insects, repellent products for companion animals, and additional over-the-counter skin products.

    The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase I project is to develop a new class of topical insect repellents by influencing repellency in the skin microbiome.  This will be accomplished by developing and validating a platform technology to identify compounds produced by the microbiome that are associated with biochemical pathways of interest, and use the identified compounds to target those pathways whose end-products comprise natural mosquito-repellent compounds. The goal is to create a topical mosquito repellent product. For this project, the plan is to complete metagenome sequencing on skin samples collected from individuals that are either naturally repellent or attractive to Anopheles mosquitoes (the mosquito that carries Malaria). The next step is to predict metabolite compound turnover and use metabolomics to validate the results. In vitro assays and in silico models will be used to provide proof-of-concept for the use of those predicted compounds to induce the microbiota to produce mosquito repellent metabolites.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will address the challenge of developing students? empathy and emotional self-awareness with a mobile-based platform. Aligning with the NSF's mission to develop innovative education programs to enhance aspects of emotional intelligence, this project will address three major pain points for young learners with far-reaching implications. First, the need to develop emotional intelligence; which has been identified as a 21st-century literacy that is crucial for younger learners to thrive. Current school climate issues with bullying and violence consistently reinforce the need to address social and emotional learning. Next, the need to integrate social and emotional learning into regular classroom activities. With the demands placed on schools for testing, having a program that integrates with what schools are already responsible should support more widespread adoption. Finally, the program addresses a widespread need to combat the deleterious effects of the current uses of social media by young students. This project will bring a positive spin to social networking that can improve the emotional intelligence skills of students


    The proposed innovation is an augmented reality-based experience that immerses fourth and fifth-grade students in activities designed to build their skills of emotional intelligence; namely, emotional self-awareness and empathy, as they interact with a network of peers. The key technical challenges the project must solve include: refining core methods for developing emotional self-awareness and empathy, defining and refining a user experience that teachers/parents will find educationally compelling and with which learners will love to engage, designing a curating process for learner-generated content that will ensure the safety and security of all users and developing virtual interactions that engage students in emotional skill development, and connecting activities with the materials for which students are already responsible.

    This STTR Phase I project aims to bring together computational thinking, mechanism design, and design process to create a new framework for design-driven robotics education for K-12 schools and camps. This work would result in a platform for 1) teaching students Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) topics and 2) providing them critical hands-on experience designing, prototyping, and programming machines. By enabling students to exercise their creativity via an intuitive design interface and a minimalist novel robot kit, this project advances the students' ability to innovate and invent machines and robots. Driven by a need to keep pace with the evolving techno- and socio-economic requirements and remain competitive, schools and camps are increasingly adopting STEM and Robotics programs and products. This framework would fill that void that currently exists in the educational market. This project is closely aligned with the NSF's mandate to support development of a strong STEM workforce. The proposed design-driven educational robotics framework has the potential to fulfill these needs, improve public scientific literacy and engagement with science and technology, and positively impact the U.S. educational robotics market, which is expected to grow to $2.7 billion by 2021.

    The proposed research seeks to develop a novel design-driven educational robotics framework encompassing 1) a modular, customizable, and compatible with off-the shelf electronics hardware kit consisting of rigid and compliant parts for rapid prototyping of robot structures and mechanisms, 2) a multi-modal mobile app for synthesis and simulation of robot motions, 3) a web-based CAD interface for designing users' custom robot parts that interface seamlessly with the kit, and 4) instructional material and curriculum for middle and high-schools. The hardware would provide a suite of planar parts with unique design capabilities to support creation of 3D geometry of robots and structures. The novel structural elements would give rise to a new method of enforcing geometric and kinematic constraints and provide flexibility in choice of material and manufacturing process. While the new connection methods are much more intuitive and simpler, they also closely mirror the way engineered structures are created in practice. The mobile app based on the latest mechanism synthesis research imbued with a multi-modal graphical user interface will allow creation of robot assemblies and their motions before constructing their corresponding physical models and provide necessary skills and experience in the design process.

    This SBIR Phase I project will develop new methods for training and assessing the skill of providing and receiving constructive feedback in collaborative environments. The United States higher education system is failing to train collaboration skills, despite companies listing it as one of the most important skills for new hires to have. Past research has identified specific types of feedback that most effectively encourage peers to improve, but today's higher education instructors have no ready means to effectively assess students' abilities to use these peer feedback strategies. This project will develop simple-to-use software tools to help instructors train peer feedback skills and new methods for automatically assessing student ability to provide and receive constructive feedback. By democratizing the training of the collaborative skills most sought after by today's employers, this project aims to reduce underemployment of college graduates and increase the economic output and tax revenues of the United States by building a better trained and more productive workforce.

    This project will develop an innovative peer-assessment tool coupled with novel natural language processing methods producing accurate measurements of student ability to give and receive constructive feedback based on written feedback. The natural language processing methods will combine word vectors for efficient language processing, a generalizable neural net structure for sentence categorization outlined in existing research literature, and manually defined features based on existing peer feedback research. Research efforts will focus on gathering a large training dataset from partnering higher education classrooms, and iteratively refining a deep-learning natural language processing algorithm to achieve a target 90% accuracy. Automating this assessment process will allow broad and continuous assessment of student collaborative ability without requiring expensive and time-consuming retraining of the United States instructor workforce.

    This SBIR Phase I project will study and develop methods to provide adult professionals and young adult students with the skills and self-confidence to pursue studies and careers in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) fields. Today, a large segment of society identifies as being underrepresented in the technology sector. Some individuals experience low technology-related self-confidence as a result. At a time when the United States has an increasing demand for technology workers, the country needs contributions from all segments of society, and not simply those segments which have been privileged in the past, to meet this demand and maintain U.S. competitive advantage in the global innovation economy. Engaging people from the full spectrum of the United States population will enable innovative companies to leverage more diverse sources of creativity, build better solutions to today's problems, and create more jobs. When people see themselves as future practitioners of a technical skill, it is possible to learn topics in a deeper, more fulfilling, and more enduring manner. Commercializing this invention will increase online learning platform retention rates, driving revenue not only within educational companies but within the companies who hire the resulting talent.


    The proposed technology is innovative because no commercially-available software tools exist which support metacognitive development in tandem with technical skill acquisition. This innovation is risky because no one has proven that having a positive influence on metacognition through automated software is even possible during single learning session. The goal of this research is to deliver techniques for enhancing the self-efficacy of STEM learners within the context of online learning platforms. The project combines best practices in digital personalization and educational psychology research to deliver customized content responsive to learner preferences and learner attitude attributes. The proposed research will demonstrate, via a random trial, increased levels of motivation and engagement in students who receive targeted interventions as compared with a control population. Using survey instruments, the researchers will measure changes in self-efficacy, challenge-seeking, and goal-setting behavior. Because the research team has unique experience in developing proven educational interventions which enhance self-efficacy across a variety of learning domains, the algorithms and methods inside the proposed technology will be difficult for competitors to replicate. This SBIR project will deliver algorithms and automated, web-based interventions to help all STEM learners experience personal engagement with STEM topics and find empowerment in the task of learning.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will be the development of a robust capillary electrophoresis instrument with mass spectrometry detection for biomedical research, biopharmaceutical development, clinical diagnostics, and system biology.  Capillary electrophoresis (CE) is a powerful liquid separation technology with remarkable potentials for bioanalysis. It was the workhorse tool for the completion of human genome project that, in part, led to the DNA sequencing market.  A CE system with both optical and mass spectrometry detection will enable a deeper understanding of molecular dynamics governing biochemical processes, such as protein expression, deregulation, and interaction with other biochemical species, which could lead to breakthroughs in drug development, early diagnosis, and treatments for deadly human diseases such as cancer, diabetics, and neurodegenerative disorders. The proposed technology will offer benefits to biopharmaceutical drug development companies by increasing the efficiency of product characterization for quality improvement. It also will allow efficient routine proteomics analysis and other bioanalytical applications.

    The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase I project is to develop a next-generation capillary electrophoresis with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (CE-ESI-MS) for protein characterization. CE-ESI-MS allows high efficiency separation and characterization of several biochemical species including proteins. However, leveraging the intrinsic advantages of CE-ESI-MS has been difficult due to lack of robust, easy-to-use instrumentation, which has made adoption for routine applications uncommon. This research will develop and evaluate a novel CE-ESI-MS instrument for protein characterization. The proposed instrument will employ original innovations to overcome the limitations of the incumbent technologies and exceed their capabilities. A novel fluidic nanoport for sample and buffer manipulation will be developed to allow analysis from 1 microL or less sample volume. The nanoport will employ a fully automated design with less operator intervention. This will be useful for sample-limited applications such as in clinical analysis. In addition, the instrument will utilize a hybrid electrospray ionization interface for simultaneous optical and MS detection, which no existing technology offers. Combining CE's ultrahigh efficiency with robust quantitative characteristics of optical detection and the molecular identification of mass spectrometry will be a powerful tool for bioanalysis. This combination will represent a significant advancement over the state-of-the-art and enhance the means of interrogating proteins and their biochemical functions in biological samples. The proposed innovations will significantly enhance the robustness and capabilities of CE-ESI-MS for fast, efficient, and deep bioanalysis.

    This SBIR Phase I project advances a novel medical optical spectroscopy device to facilitate accurate diagnosis of middle ear infections.  The device uses a custom multi-LED microchip and photodetectors to illuminate the middle ear and collect reflected light in a familiar otoscope form-factor.   Reflected light signatures are analyzed to determine the presence or absence of middle ear fluid - a hallmark of middle ear infection.  The focus is to optimize product design and algorithm to enable gold standard accuracy across thousands of mass manufactured devices and millions of patients.  The device will be a cost effective means to achieving improved ear infection diagnosis in primary care where it is most needed.  Roughly 90% of children experience at least one ear infection before age 5 and misdiagnosis of suspected ear infection is the leading cause of unnecessary pediatric antibiotic use in the US.  Collectively, ear infection results in at least $5B direct healthcare costs annually in the US and billions more in lost parent productivity.  Improving ear infection diagnosis has the potential to eliminate millions of unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions - a crucial step in mitigating development of resistant microorganisms.  Addressing this challenge requires a product that is cost-effective and consistently accurate.

    This project will enable the first commercially available optical spectroscopy product for middle ear effusion and the only known method capable of accurately assessing ear health in very waxy ears.  Although optical spectroscopy as a scientific method is widely practiced, comparatively few commercial medical products exist.  High-cost, bulky spectrometer units are a primary limitation restricting development of products tailored to primary care and other low margin medical specialties where there is great need.  The proposed work enables cost-effective manufacture and deployment of the proposed device for ear infection and will be a platform for other next-generation, LED-based optical spectroscopy medical devices.  The investigators will develop an algorithmic scheme to correct variability in mass manufactured LED and photodiode components and design and construct test systems to automatically apply corrections to each completed medical device assembly.  The resultant methods and systems will enable deployment of medical optical spectroscopy systems at up to 100X lower unit cost as compared to spectrometer based systems.  The resultant device for ear infection will enable clinicians to more easily adhere to American Academy of Pediatrics and American Academy of Family Physicians guidelines for treating ear infections in primary care where there is greatest need.

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to accelerate the commercialization of organic
    light-emitting diode (OLED) technology.  For color displays (TV, cell phone, computer,
    virtual reality, watches, etc.) OLED is superior to all existing technologies
    in terms of energy usage, display color space, viewing angle, etc.  For lighting,
    OLED fixtures use very low energy, the light is soft, casts no shadow, and is
    architecturally flexible.  OLED is the display and lighting technology of the
    future.  However cost and short device lifetime has retarded commercial advancement.
    \ The introduction of an entirely new class of materials for OLED manufacturing
    will enable this advancement. \n\nThe proposed project will reduce OLED cost and
    improve performance by utilizing a new class of photoelectric materials for the
    nanometer thick layers that comprise an OLED.  OLED layers utilize single-component
    small molecules for the charge transporting and light-emitting layers.  These
    molecules tend to crystallize and are poor solvents for the emitting molecules
    leading to decreased light emission efficiency and shortened device lifetime.
    \ The innovation is using isomeric mixtures of designed molecules that are amorphous
    and non-crystallizable in all three layers.  These molecules are chemically designed
    to meet all the required photophysical and electrical characteristics necessary
    for superior OLED performance.  Preliminary device fabrication and testing has
    confirmed that these new materials dramatically improve both emission efficiency
    and device lifetime with the standard emitter molecules.  Due to the physics of
    charge recombination in the emitter layer there is only one technology which has
    the potential to harvest 100% of the injected charge as emitted light:  thermally
    activated delayed fluorescence (TADF).  OLEDs using TADF technology have demonstrated
    high efficiency but with very short device lifetime.  This project will couple
    the new non-crystallizable technology with TADF to design and fabricate OLED devices
    with both high efficiency and long life to meet commercialization requirements.\n\nThis

    on planar or curved surfaces that are either conducting (metals) or insulators
    (glass/plastic). Current multipoint touch sensing technologies are limited to
    transparent, insulating and planar surfaces. These technologies involve patterning
    multiple layers of semitransparent films on a glass or polyamide substrate then
    integrated with the display in a complex manufacturing process. The films? semitransparent

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is empowering the 68 million U.S. natural gas consumers to know their transaction status in real time, have more and continual control of their transactions, settle transactions in increments less than the industry?s current monthly accounting cycle and enjoy an extremely high level of security. Their transaction cost will be reduced and speed increased, freeing industry capacity and resources to be employed elsewhere at greater value. This innovation will allow others in the natural gas industry to better consider transaction processes and themselves innovate - employing many minds on industry efficiency. This innovation will also have application to other industries characterized by multiple complex, multi-party transactions; particularly the electric utility industry and possibly providing the catalyst for more extensive deregulation and consumer control.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to discover how to transform complex natural gas utility transaction management processes using Blockchain innovations and related technologies across production, transmission, distribution and consumption functions. The United States utility industry has operated in its present physical form for more than a century. Over the past four decades the industry has evolved through various policy and regulatory actions to open transaction participation to thousands of parties. During the past two decades, digital technologies enabled transaction functions to talk to each other and perform some functions automatically. Despite this progress, utility transaction management processes are essentially those created decades ago. They still require significant human intervention, remain highly segmented and employ little digital intelligence and security technology available today. The various technologies now supporting the industry?s seven step transaction processes will be mapped, assessed for Blockchain technology application and then consolidated into a single platform. The key challenge is to create transformative technology integrating the numerous other existing technology applications and data exchange formats and protocols without succumbing to customization which then mutes the transformative nature of the innovation and renders it ineffective as a platform to subsequent industry innovation by multiple parties.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) project is the development of a unique cloud computing platform
    with a novel database and bioinformatic software package to address the strong
    demand for transformative foundational resources crucial to interpret the biological
    function of DNA variation sequestered within and between genomes. The goal is
    to target a broad scope of laboratories investigating human genomics and disease,
    comparative and evolutionary genomics, systems biology, animal health and veterinary
    sciences, and wildlife biodiversity and conservation. The product will offer opportunities
    to advance cross-disciplinary research to keep pace with the accelerating rate
    of DNA sequence variant discoveries driving the extraordinary growth of the genomics
    industry.  This vision is founded on the continued rapid growth projections (in
    billions of dollars) for the genomics market and the concomitant increase in the
    need for integrative tools and services.  The technology will allow customers
    to save time and research costs, experience substantial increases in efficiency
    and accuracy, and explore, in precise detail, complex gene networks and pathways.
    \ \n\nThe intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase I project is to resolve a critical
    impasse in genomic workflow where inconsistent or unreliable identification of
    DNA variant function prevents actionable discoveries. Using the customized suite
    of bioinformatic tools provided by this technology development, the customer will
    be able to interrogate the database for any gene or gene system of interest, determine
    the normal range of DNA changes tolerated by the gene within functional space,
    and screen their own data against this baseline to identify variants causative
    in altered biological function and phenotypic traits. The research objectives
    include: Compiling proprietary and novel DNA sequences from thousands of genes,
    establishing and confirming the precise arrangement of these gene sequences guided
    by shared common ancestry to create the database framework, establishing a plan
    for product software and content to guide the user through proper use of the database
    and interpret variant function, and developing strategies to ensure product security
    and cloud-computing service data visualization and display to protect the processing
    of user data when passed within the software.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory
    mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the demonstration of the technical and economic feasibility of a photonic crystal enabled thermophotovoltaic (TPV) system at scales over 10 watts, which would have transformative effects in power generation for portable and remote applications. A small, high energy density TPV power source has the potential to transform multiple markets that currently rely on battery power by reducing the battery weight by 75%. For example, remote scientific instrumentation stations in polar regions rely on 1000-2000 pounds of batteries to operate through the six-month polar night, resulting in high installation costs. Dismounted warfighters carry 10-20 pounds of batteries and would have greater capability if they could carry ammunition and water instead. Small unmanned aerial vehicles would be more effective if they could fly themselves to remote and inaccessible locations, perform their mission for longer, and then return.

    The proposed project will develop a new approach to photonic crystal fabrication to greatly improve the efficiency of TPV energy generation - the conversion of fuel into electricity with heat and light as intermediaries. A TPV generator works by burning fuel to heat a selective emitter to incandescence, leading to infrared radiation which drives specialized photovoltaic cells to generate electricity. A photonic crystal selective emitter greatly improves the efficiency of the generator by almost perfectly matching its emission spectrum to the photovoltaic cell. Our photonic crystal is a square array of cylindrical micro-cavities etched into a refractory metal substrate. The research objectives of this project address the technical hurdles that limit the use of photonic crystals in TPV: scalable substrate preparation from commercial foils using a novel high-throughput process; nanofabrication over large flexible substrates using traditional semiconductor manufacturing tools; and integration with the generator by brazing. The anticipated technical results of this project are to develop a process capable of a breakthrough fifty-fold increase in photonic crystal emitter area, to enable photonic crystal fabrication on flexible substrates, and to reduce photonic crystal cost - all leading to a practical TPV generator that meets market demands.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to, firstly, shed light on the benefits and limitations of mm-wave backscatter technologies in challenging industrial environments. More importantly, the lessons learned during this project could, if successful, bring about the emergence of breakthrough energy-autonomous real-time tracking technologies that would significantly increase the efficiency and reduce the costs of worldwide container shipping as well as provide a direct value that could bring about the adoption of the smart container. The container shipping industry stands as one of the unsung heroes of the modern world which, from its birth in the 1960s, cut the cost of shipping goods across the globe by several orders of magnitude, thereby enabling global trade on a massive scale and catalyzing the world?s economic development. Nevertheless, this industry has remained largely unmoved by the advent of big data and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. This innovation could empower the general introduction and leveraging of such tools, further lower the costs and increase the accessibility of worldwide shipping, and significantly benefit the world and the United States? economies.

    The proposed project will require, on the road towards commercialization, the exploration of the properties of backscatter mm-wave localization approaches and channels in complex highly cluttered environments such as that of metallic-parts-crowded repair facilities and terminals covered with container stacks. While significant research efforts are currently invested in the characterization and mapping of mm-wave transmission channels necessary to the planning and rolling out of upcoming cellular 5G networks, no such work has yet been reported for their backscatter counterparts, nor for localization purposes. In addition, although the influence of channels for standard Radio Frequency IDentification-based localization systems has benefited from decades of investigation, that of its higher-frequency correspondent is virtually unexplored and should display different properties and present novel challenges and opportunities, due to major differences in clutter diffraction and absorption. The work will start with the finalization of tag and reader hardware in view of the gathering of detection data in the aforementioned environments, followed by the formulation of the high-performance signal processing schemes used to retrieve tag positions and identities, developed hand in hand with optimized communications modulation schemes for the tags. Finally, a tuning of the devised numerical processing schemes for high-speed embedded processing will take place.

    Nontechnical paragraph:
    This SBIR Phase I project presents an opportunity to develop and test an educational platform designed to improve motivation levels in students with respect to the STEM disciplines, especially Mathematics. The core activity of the proposed platform consists of live academic competition, students answering questions in a game-based, online arena. The platform will, in essence, borrow the features and structures found in popular athletic sports, from points, scoreboards and rankings to leagues, tournaments and championships, and reproduce them online so that students can compete academically in the classroom just like they compete athletically on the sports field, with similar performance gains and improvements to peer dynamics expected to follow. Leveraging classic game mechanics in an exciting online format, the platform has the potential to motivate students across the skill and demographic spectrums where offline academic competitions have historically failed. In past attempts to improve learning outcomes and close the achievement gap, the U.S. has focused on inputs, e.g., class-size, book counts, etc., and more recently, outputs, e.g., standardized test scores. This project offers the chance to approach learning improvement from a new angle or perspective. By focusing directly on student motivation with a structure only recently made possible by the advent of the internet age, this project leverages the power of competition in an effort to advance the stated NSF missions of developing a globally competitive STEM workforce and increasing economic competitiveness in the U.S.

    Technical paragraph:
    This project entails the development of a web and mobile platform with the ability to host and engage every student across the U.S. in robust, online competition activity. As such, the proposed activity is expansive in its breadth and scope and therefore presents an immense challenge, both from a technical and a design perspective. In the U.S., the vast majority of students are educated in a school district setting. Therefore, the platform must be designed in such a way as to fit neatly within the parameters of school district scheduling, processes and structures. It must be comprehensive in its design, seamlessly blending together the experiences of very different users. Three distinct roles are imagined: an administrator of the platform will have the ability to create leagues, tournaments, and championships, team-based and individual-based, for students across the school district/network; a teacher on the platform will be able to arrange matches for a team/class of students by dividing them into multiple teams that play against each other or challenging another team in the same school district/network to a match; a student on the platform will be able to arrange individual-based matches with other students in the same school district/network or play against a personal best avatar. Bringing all such activity together into a single platform, one that can be integrated with existing online education platforms and replicated from school district to school district across the U.S., satisfies NSF?s objective of supporting projects of high technical risk.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will provide new opportunities for purifying waters that cannot be economically treated using existing commercial membranes.  Increased market growth to include recycle and re-use of contaminated water that is currently slated for disposal or long term environmentally risky storage will increase water availability for industry and agriculture and reduce environmental impact from these same users.  More available water, especially in higher demand locations, will lead to higher production and lower costs for industrial and agriculture based consumers, leading to job growth.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to validate a new method of thin film composite membrane fabrication using new materials strategies to produce game changing anti-fouling and chlorine resistant reverse osmosis membranes.  Current market dominating polyamide thin film composite (TFC) membranes are inherently susceptible to fouling and degraded by chlorine disinfectants used to mitigate bio-fouling, which is the greatest challenge to membrane operation.  The established TFC production technique provides very thin active layers on the order of 100?s of nanometers but is limited to polyamides.  The proposed technology will produce TFCs with alternative polymers.  Polymers that are chlorine resistant and inherently non-fouling are targeted for use but the unmet challenge has been the opportunity to manufacture them with membrane thicknesses down to the 100?s of nm thickness regime necessary to challenge the flux properties of current commercial membranes.  Combining this new fabrication technology and new polymers is the technological breakthrough needed to develop innovative membranes.  The project will synthesize a target polymer composition, develop the formulation and fabrication parameters within the new process and produce TFC samples for testing.  TFC samples will undergo comparative testing of fouling and chlorine resistance, water flux and salt rejection in a variety of simulated test waters.

    This SBIR Phase I project will develop Virtual Reality (VR) based curriculum for first year university science courses. VR has the potential to create a step change in the way STEM education is taught and ultimately the way students learn. This project aims to build VR science curriculum to make science education more accessible, engaging and effective, and turn traditional STEM leavers into stayers which will positively impact STEM retention to meet the U.S. workforce demand. The VR science curriculum will be used alongside the existing curriculum at universities, with students participating in one 30-minute virtual lesson a week. The effect of these lessons on the students' performance will be measured to validate the ability of VR to positively impact learning outcomes. This project supports the NSF mission by progressing the science of education, by developing education tools using the scientific method, and measuring effectiveness. Moreover, the focus on improving university science education will improve the workforce pipeline, creating more and better prepared scientists. The products resulting from the proposed work will make science more accessible preparing today's students to be tomorrow's inventors, problem solvers and next great minds.

    The intellectual merit of this project is in the approach to developing VR curricula, and continually validating each curriculum by using data science to correlate student performance in the lesson to their performance in the classroom. Each lesson combines exposition, active learning, problem-based inquiry and assessment into self-contained modules which can be added to any existing curriculum. Student actions, and concept mastery are tracked within each lesson; ultimately, to correlate what the student is doing in a VR lesson to their learning outcome in real time. This enables the project team to validate which components of each lesson are working to improve student learning outcomes, and continually refine the VR pedagogy. This approach to developing each lesson and the cycle of refinement is the key innovation of the project team. The goal of the proposed research is to evaluate the magnitude of learning outcome improvement achieved when VR lessons are added to existing curricula, correlate the student actions in the VR lesson to their learning outcome as measured through in-class assessments, and evaluate perceived implementation hurdles for use of VR by instructors. This will be accomplished by integrating VR lessons in university curriculum and measuring the results against a control group. Instructor feedback will be gathered through a mixed methods study.

    This SBIR Phase I project is focused on demonstrating the feasibility of an innovative crowdfunding process to effectively support and grow the fourth sector economy at the local community level. This fourth sector economy, a blend of three traditional economic sectors (public, private and nonprofit) is poised to solve many of the world's most difficult and complex social problems; however, this sector cannot work effectively without a supportive ecosystem that enables the creation, funding, and operation of organizations within it. This project proposes an innovative Fourth Sector Ecosystem incubator that brings a coordinated suite of services to local communities to engage them, educate them, and provide financial capital through a crowdfunding platform. This project will engage four communities in a pilot study designed to engage and educate key leaders, energize advocacy for fourth-sector growth, and catalyze fourth-sector social enterprises by offering capital access through crowdfunding. The validation of this grass-roots scalable educational and participatory incubator will enable communities to support local for-benefit businesses who will improve the quality of life in their communities, create jobs, and contribute to the economy, leading to expansion of this model across the nation and globally.


    The innovation inherent in this educational platform is the synergy between the components of its scalable, turnkey process to provide a catalyst for fourth-sector business growth. Innovative components include a robust, secure crowdfunding platform, educational training for community leaders and businesses in fourth-sector principles, assessment methods to evaluate/provide continuous improvement of the process, gamification that rewards fourth-sector-supporting behaviors; and network-building processes. The goals of this research are to determine the performance, design and educational training specifications that will address the needs of all stakeholders (e.g., entrepreneurs, community leaders, contributors), and demonstrate the feasibility of this platform through a pilot study in four communities. Methods will focus on continuous evaluation and feedback from stakeholders in the four communities to determine best methods to teach communities to manage their incubators, activate their communities to participate, achieve campaign success, demonstrate improved learning outcomes from the training, and increase the density and reciprocity of networks in the pilot communities. Surveys and data will be collected and analyzed to determine the effectiveness of each component in the process, from planning to implementation to assessment, as shown through survey results, expansion of networks, and funding raised by fourth sector enterprises using the crowdfunding tool.

    This SBIR Phase I project is focused on continued development of a software platform that is used by students for peer to peer homework and studying help. After school help has historically been delivered by tutors and homework hotlines but those avenues have been proven to be inadequate in closing learning gaps for students after they exit the classroom. The proposed technology is expected to further democratize homework and studying help. Being peer to peer, the proposed technology can radically shrink the cost of personalized homework and studying help for students at their own time and pace - especially the ones from economically or socially more challenged backgrounds. The project will also explore use of an innovative business model to optimize commercial viability with impacting a broad range of students irrespective of their backgrounds. It is expected that when fully developed, the technology would emerge as a scalable low-cost option to help improve student learning outcomes both nationally and globally.

    The key intellectual merit of this project is in the development of a Smart Study Recommendations Engine. This involves harvesting the data from the class notes uploaded by students, analyze it to surface predictive insights and automatically deliver the notes or wide-ranging peer-reviewed study materials directly to the student users based on their learning styles, learning abilities, and learning gaps, without requiring them to perform a search. It will also provide them with an ability to connect them with peers who can provide additional support. Thus, this project seeks to provide personalized study playlists based on a student profile and pair them with a peer mentor who can provide deeper clarifications as required. The key outcome to be demonstrated is that 1 in 5 students engages favorably with the auto delivered math notes, helped by a peer who can provide clarity and tutoring as needed.

    This SBIR Phase I project will provide children ages 7-11 years with an interactive learning program that cultivates core leadership skills. This project goes deeper than many traditional socio-emotional programs by fortifying children with the behavioral skills and mindset they need to evolve as effective leaders. The educational curriculum was developed by psychologists who specialize in leadership development, and is based on cutting-edge child developmental, leadership, and educational research. This project aims to research the engagement and effectiveness of the program and its ability to enhance ten core leadership behaviors in youth, at home, in the community, and in academic settings. This program has the potential to make a long-term impact on the next generation of youth, promoting resilience in the face of adverse events, such as school violence and cyberbullying, and to positively shape the next generation of leaders, helping them form lifelong commitments to personal and professional development. The project has philanthropic aspirations to make the educational curriculum available to all children and schools, regardless of socio-economic standing, supporting the mission of NSF to promote the health, prosperity and welfare of the nation through science.


    This project is focused on the development of an interactive leadership program for children, that is proven to make a positive impact on leadership behaviors and that is also fun and engaging for youth and their adult caregivers and educators. What sets this program apart from others is that the research will provide evidence that the program builds the critical skills it intends on developing in children. The program is designed to be self-led or facilitated by an adult caregiver or educator, either using an online platform or physical materials.  As children move from one leadership competency to another, they are extrinsically and intrinsically rewarded for their efforts. Adult caregivers and educators are encouraged to participate and are provided mastery building exercises that help them take the child?s leadership understanding and skill to the next level. A database has been developed to track real-time participant feedback as curriculum elements are developed. The testing of educational content will focus on three aspects, which include maximizing content appropriateness, validating learning and skill retention, and assessing variances and preferences for mode of delivery. Results will be used to make modifications to the curriculum and product design for commercialization.

    Transfer (STTR) project is the advancement of improved lithium ion batteries.
    The project will evaluate new battery chemistry enabling more rapid charging rates
    then currently available in the worldwide energy storage marketplace. Such high
    power density batteries would cater to a major emerging battery segment where
    current lithium ion battery technologies fall dramatically short. Successful development
    of this innovation will provide benefits to both current and future applications.
    Clearly, large scale deployment of a markedly superior energy storage device will
    have significant societal benefits by accelerating the move away from fossil fuel
    in many applications and products. For instance, a viable regenerative braking
    energy storage technology based on the proposed technology would result in a tremendous
    reduction in electricity used by subway trains, with a concomitant reduction of
    CO2 emissions. \n\nThis STTR Phase I project proposes to address the core of the
    microstructure - performance relations in energy storing materials, answering
    a series of fundamental questions regarding how a charge carrier is reversibly
    or irreversibly stored at high rates in manganese oxide - carbon nanocomposite
    anodes. In conventional LIBs, it is the graphite-based anode that limits charging
    rates, with catastrophic lithium metal plating and dendrite growth occurring at
    increased currents. It is expected that many of the existing \"Graphite - Inherited\"
    paradigms regarding fast rate in anodes would be done away with, or substantially
    redefined with the proposed approach for designing high power lithium ion batteries
    based on an inexpensive hemp-derived carbon nanosheets and nanostructured manganese
    oxide anodes. A much clearer understanding of the synthesis - structure - property
    relations in such nanocomposites will have wide-reaching scientific and technological
    implications. Research and development activities will focus on structural optimization
    and manufacturing scalability along with fabrication and testing of near-commercial
    pouch cell form factors in order to demonstrate device-level performance and commercial
    viability of the proposed technology.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR)
    project is to improve outcomes and decrease costs in the mental health space by engaging
    patients starting with their first therapy session through objective progress reporting and
    post-session motivation. Patients and clinicians alike will be able to track and assess treatment
    progress through self-reported and physiological measures. This innovation builds upon the
    strong academic, government, and industry partnerships that will advance research and
    innovation in the field of biotechnology. By demonstrating improved outcomes and decreased
    costs associated with the utilization of technology, this will pave the way for insurance
    reimbursement (using existing CPT codes) to accelerate market adoption. Additionally, as
    education of patients and the public improves regarding mental health and PTSD in particular,
    the negative stigma surrounding these conditions will decrease and more people in need will
    seek help rather than resorting to unhealthy behavior or even suicide.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to represent an innovative approach that provides easy to
    interpret results tailored to mental health providers, patients, and other non-technical users.
    Current mental health treatment and assessment has lacked qualitative, scientifically-based
    measurement. The need for a scientific measurement is evident, as about 8 percent of all
    adults - 1 of 13 people in this country will develop PTSD during their lifetime. Currently, 60%
    of adults diagnosed with a mental illness don't receive mental health treatment; using proven
    science and physiologic measurements as the foundation for improving treatment and
    monitoring progress for PTSD can help to alleviate some of the stigma surrounding mental
    illnesses. This project aims to demonstrate how implementing a web-based platform can
    improve PTSD treatment by providing physiologically relevant feedback to the patient and by
    providing a tool for the clinician to tailor the therapy to the individual patient. Patients will have
    their subjective measures and physiological data visualized throughout treatment on a software
    platform, with progress being tracked through validated assessment scales. Patients will be
    compared to others in treatment as usual. Results should yield improved quality of life and
    decrease long term healthcare costs for those that use the platform.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this STTR project stems
    from the costs to U.S. food producers of outbreaks of animal diseases.  Producers
    of poultry, pork, and other food proteins lose more than $1B each year to infectious
    diseases, including some that are transmitted through the air.  For diseases having
    an airborne transmission route, protective technologies that are available are
    few and can be costly to implement and operate.  This project furthers the development
    of a new alternative technology, non-thermal plasmas, for the simultaneous removal
    and inactivation in air of the organisms responsible for the transmission of disease
    to livestock.  This project evaluates how conditions in the environment typically
    found near livestock affect the performance of non-thermal plasmas.  This project
    also pursues a technique for accelerating the process of improving non-thermal
    plasma performance, upon the completion of which new and improved non-thermal
    plasma devices can be developed for applications such as this more rapidly than
    is possible now.  Completion of the project will enable the development of lower-cost
    protective technologies for maintaining livestock health, making such technologies
    economically accessible to a larger segment of food protein producers, ultimately
    lowering food costs and increasing domestic food security.  \n\nThis STTR Phase
    I project proposes to experimentally demonstrate and evaluate the effectiveness
    of a non-thermal plasma (NTP) as a means of preventing disease-carrying particles
    in outside air from infecting livestock housed in animal confinement buildings.
    \  NTPs are stable electrical discharges that simultaneously contribute to the
    removal of airborne particles while also subjecting them to chemical attack capable
    of killing harmful viruses.  While NTPs have been demonstrated for disinfection
    of fixed surfaces, and to a lesser degree for the destruction of chemical contaminants
    or biological pathogens in air, the intellectual merit of this project stems from
    its evaluation of trace gases commonly present in the air around livestock, ammonia
    and hydrogen sulfide, and their potential to both enhance and diminish the performance
    of NTPs used in farm environments.   Additionally, this project will identify
    non-biological tracers suitable for use in NTP optimization testing which will
    accelerate the development of improved designs.  Two separate lab-scale NTP reactors
    will be used in the execution of the project.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory

    The broader impact/commercialization potential of this project is to address the need for a small, low-cost, and high-accuracy angular rate and angular orientation sensor (also known as a gyroscope) for a wide range of applications.  Gyroscopes are desired by many emerging applications such as inertial measurement units for small satellites such as CubeSats, autonomous vehicles, drones, and high-end wearable electronics.  These applications require a gyroscope with a similar price (< $10) but ~10,000 times better accuracy than those currently used in smartphones.  The birdbath resonator gyroscope (BRG) is a novel micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) gyroscope with a strong potential to satisfy the needs of these applications due to significantly better resonance quality and mechanical symmetry than current silicon gyroscopes.  The economic impact of BRGs will be enormous since many industries can utilize high-performance gyroscopes to monitor the dynamics of their systems, provide positional awareness, and improve the performance of other parts of these systems.  Availability of low-cost and high-performance gyroscopes will enable users to further understand their applications and explore their limits and applicability across a broad range of societal needs.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a new batch-level microfabrication technology to enable the commercialization of low-cost, very high-performance MEMS gyroscope from fused-silica.  Gyroscopes available today are either accurate but large and expensive (example: hemispherical resonator gyroscope), or small and cheap but inaccurate (example: smartphone gyroscopes).  High-accuracy silicon MEMS gyroscopes in research are small and accurate but expensive.  This is because silicon has fundamentally low mechanical resonance quality factor (Q) so it is difficult to manufacture high-accuracy gyroscopes with a high yield.  The BRG is a gyroscope made from fused-silica and capable of having low cost, small size, and high performance.  Its fused silica micro mechanical resonator can achieve significantly higher Q than silicon, which allows the BRG to be manufactured with a high yield.  The BRG fabrication process uses a blowtorch to reflow-mold a fused silica substrate into three-dimensional hollow shells with dimensions of several 10s of micrometers to several millimeters with high geometrical accuracy.  The proposed research will significantly enhance our understanding of the relationships among size, design, and process on the performance of the BRG as well as the relationship among detailed process parameters, yield and reproducibility on cost.

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase I project will develop a very long-acting buprenorphine
    formulation to increase patient compliance and address the opioid crisis. Poor
    medication compliance is a significant driver of health care costs. The US would
    save an estimated 290 billion dollars yearly or 13% of the total health care budget
    if patients took their medications as directed. Patients with chronic diseases
    are the least compliant with medication. There is an evolving consensus that Opioid
    Misuse Disorder (OMD) is also a chronic disease, and its treatment is also plagued
    by poor compliance. There are an estimated 2.5 million people in the United States
    with OMD. Complete abstinence therapy fails about 80% of the time. Medication-assisted
    therapy using methadone, naltrexone or buprenorphine is far more successful. More
    opioid misuse patients are treated with buprenorphine than methadone, and retention
    in treatment is up to 78% with additional counseling. Still, 80% of all people
    who misuse opioids never obtain any therapy for their disorder, risking overdose,
    other diseases, including HIV and Hepatitis, and amyloidosis. Extended-release
    medications for opioid maintenance therapy would open up more options to get people
    into therapy. A 3-month release formulation of buprenorphine would be a part of
    that strategy.  \n\nBuprenorphine is a partial agonist opioid drug that is used
    for treatment of pain in human and animal patients and for opioid addiction maintenance.
    A platform technology has been developed that can be used to formulate extended-release
    preparations of drugs that are weak bases and are mildly lipophilic. Preparations
    of buprenorphine, naltrexone and doxycycline have been developed using this method.
    The initial proposed product is an injectable formulation of buprenorphine that
    releases over a period of 3 months. This project will address the occurrence of
    a brief peak of early drug release in the 3-month duration buprenorphine formulation.
    The experiments in the current proposal will examine three different methods of
    decreasing the early peak by manipulating the amount of lipid engulfed by macrophages
    at a given dose of drug or by preventing macrophage engulfment of the lipid particles
    entirely by coating the lipid particles with chemicals that make them unlikely
    to be phagocytized. Preliminary results indicate that changing the drug to lipid
    ratio as described in the current proposal will reduce the peak of early release.
    Reducing the early peak will prevent sedative effects, improve the pharmacokinetics
    of the preparation and make dose escalation studies easier and more straight forward.\n\nThis

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project scales the production of renewable monomers that give access to performance nylon polyamides with tailorable functional properties for applications in the automotive, food & beverage packaging, textiles, and other industries. The revolutionary technology will be a disruptive force to the $40 billion nylon polyamide industry by addressing nylon?s weaknesses such as undesired moisture adsorption, which results in loss of dimensional stability and tensile strength. These shortcomings lead industries to make compromises in selecting their materials; for instance, longer chain polyamides are used for moisture resistance but at the expense of desired viscoelastic properties. The proposed bio-advantaged monomers will 1) help ease reliance on petroleum-based chemicals resulting in greener production processes and a cleaner environment, 2) present new opportunities for innovation and use of performance plastics due to the platform that bio-advantaged monomers offer. This is expected to generate new jobs at multiple points in the value chain. Demand for agricultural goods by fermentation facilities will increase. Sumatra Biorenewables and its partners will create jobs to meet demand for monomer production and purification. Finally, polymer producers and the manufacturing industry will produce superior products, increasing the competitiveness of the U.S. chemical industry.

    The intellectual merit of this project is to combine fermentation and chemical conversion for the production of bio-advantaged monomers and their corresponding performance-enhanced polyamides. The inexpensive, robust, and efficient monomer production process in conjunction with the customizable nature of bio-advantaged monomers to yield nylon derivatives that are hydrophobic, flame retardant, anti-static, or otherwise tailorable, afford opportunities to meet a number of needs in the manufacturing sector. The innovation?s success hinges on a monomer production process that utilizes an inexpensive electrochemical conversion that operates near 100% efficiency and that only uses water as a reactant and electricity as an energy source. In addition, the monomer production process is insensitive to the feedstock source and the impurities present in fermentation broths. Therefore, separation and purification is only required after monomer production, resulting in huge cost savings. Laboratory-tested samples of hydrophobic nylon perform equally well as dry nylon, but without the disadvantage of moisture sensitivity. This project will enable Sumatra Biorenewables to transition to a continuous flow, kilogram-scale, production process and supply potential customers with samples for performance testing.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I is the improvement of public transportation services for people with disabilities, specifically people with visual impairments. Individuals with visual impairments are heavily dependent on public transit as an essential service for engaging in daily life and social activities. However, they often face challenges with (1) determining which bus to board, especially at busy bus stops when multiple buses approach, and (2) boarding the correct bus in a timely fashion before they leave the stop. By developing an advanced notification service for alerting bus drivers, SeeingBus will address the societal and market needs to mitigate these challenges and thereby promote independent use of public transportation among people with visual impairments. Improving accessibility of public transportation to people with disabilities along with enhancing perception of their service will boost ridership resulting in increased revenue for agencies. The project will contribute to the scientific community as well as society in general by advancing understanding of Smart City services needed for independent travel of people with disabilities.

    The proposed project will develop and commercialize a Smart City service to improve public transportation for people with visual impairments. The service, SeeingBus, provides an advanced notification to bus drivers about users waiting at their next stop. People with visual impairments often miss buses due to challenges they face with boarding the correct bus. SeeingBus aims to improve accessibility of public transportation by engaging bus drivers even before the bus arrives at the stop where riders with visual impairments are waiting. As part of the smart city vision, SeeingBus will enhance connectivity of public transportation systems through greater communication between riders, bus stops, and bus drivers by means of smart sensors. Using big data, SeeingBus alerts bus drivers about users with disabilities, so the drivers can assist individuals in boarding the bus safely. The research objective of this project is to develop and test the feasibility of the SeeingBus system. Advancing public transportation, essential to promoting the travel and independence of individuals, aligns with the NSF mission to advance prosperity and welfare through scientific advancements.

    This SBIR Phase I project will develop text, speech and image analysis technologies to transform a set of educational lecture videos into an interactive learning companion. A lecture video will be presented as a series of topically cohesive sections, each represented by a textual summary, a visual summary, and a video segment. Students will be able to query a series of lecture videos with the answers presented as a combination of text, images, speech with transcript, and video, along with links to additional relevant resources. These technological enhancements will drive the development of the lecture video management system with capabilities well beyond commercial state of the art. The students will gain the ability to instantly access any information in a semester long course, with little overhead for the instructor. The business plan focuses on a freemium model designed for wide adoption with no cost to instructors and a very low cost to students. The ultimate potential societal benefit is a significantly better learning experience and learning outcomes for higher education students.


    The key innovations in this project are summarization of video segments and a Questions & Answers (QA) system customized for a series of lecture videos. These are formidable challenges despite existing substantial related research in text mining and image analysis. The information content of a lecture video spans multiple modalities, specifically, screen text, images, and speech. Further, each modality has unique characteristics. Screen text is typically unstructured and includes Optical Character Recognition errors. Transcripts from classroom lecture videos contain informal classroom interactions and suffer from speech recognition errors. The images in a lecture video can represent a variety of concepts including illustrative examples, graphs and charts, and camera images. Innovative approaches to topic modeling will be developed to handle the unique nature of the input compared to most documents. The project will employ representation learning approaches to map from each modality to a common semantic space that will drive the matching between student questions and the content of lecture videos. Since the best answer to a student question may not be fully contained in a lecture video, external resources including textbooks, message boards, and actual quizzes and exams will also be analyzed to drive the QA module.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project covers a myriad of domains including wireless health-care, remote education, supply-chain management, public safety, anti-poverty initiatives, market-places, and entertainment. However, a more immediate work product from this effort is a powerful fully-digital mmWave software defined radio (SDR) platform that will be made available to academic researchers at very affordable rates; this will spur further research and make mmWave testbed experimentation within the reach of lightly-funded academic research groups. The ambitious goal of making this transformative technology the reference design of future mmWave radios represents a massive commercial opportunity which is not limited to the cellular ecosystem (base station, tablets and smartphones), but rather extends to new connected players such as cars, drones, virtual reality (VR) headsets and beyond.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project focuses on the development of millimeter-wave (mmWave) radio technologies for next generation wireless systems. The mmWave frequencies of above 28 GHz are necessary to alleviate the spectrum crunch in the traditional cellular bands, and to make ultra-fast 5th Generation (5G) cellular a reality. However, the uniquely challenging propagation characteristics at these frequencies necessitates the use of transceivers that not only operate over low power budgets, but also deliver the robustness that the cellular ecosystem demands. While existing transceivers allow the radio to look (i.e., transmit or receive) in only one direction or a small number of directions at a time, the proposed transceiver design allows the radio to look in all directions simultaneously. While seemingly simple, this unique ability - combined with a top-down implementation ? will provide enormous benefits to cellular systems at reasonable power budgets. The proposed technology forms the key technological bridge between the theoretical promise of mmWave and actually achieving it in the real world.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) project is the development of an effective and sustainable alternative
    to antibiotics and biocides used in animal feed, which will help mitigate the
    global health threat of multidrug-resistant bacteria. The beef cattle industry
    is under increasing regulatory and public pressure to reduce or eliminate the
    use of antibiotic feed additives as they are considered a major factor driving
    the proliferation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. However, in-feed antibiotics
    provide significant economic and animal welfare benefits to the cattle industry
    by reducing the incidence and severity of liver abscesses. This project provides
    an alternative for these conflicting concerns by providing a cost-effective alternative
    to in-feed antibiotics. Further, with sufficient understanding of how the rumen
    microbiome impacts animal physiology and performance, this technology could be
    easily adapted to selectively target microbial species that reduce animal growth
    or feed efficiency, or that produce methane, increasing the economic and environmental
    sustainability of livestock agriculture. \n\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes
    to develop a low-dose, bacteriophage-based feed additive that can be prophylactically
    administered to control the growth of pathogenic Fusobacterium necrophorum in
    cattle rumen. F. necrophorum is a causative agent of liver abscesses in grain-fed
    cattle, and antibiotics are currently added to feed to prevent its growth and
    limit abscess occurrence. However, in-feed antibiotics promote the proliferation
    of antibiotic resistant bacteria, and can cause undesirable off-target effects
    to the rumen microbiome. This research seeks to develop broad host-range (polyvalent)
    bacteriophages as an economical means of controlling cattle pathogens. Polyvalent
    bacteriophages will be isolated using specialized methods that select for those
    with a predetermined host-range based on rumen microbial composition. Each bacteriophage
    will then be characterized and tested for efficacy within a bioreactor operated
    to simulate the cattle rumen. Bacteriophage cocktails will be formulated and tested
    for their ability to minimize the development of bacteriophage resistance. The
    expected outcome of the proposed research is a library of polyvalent bacteriophages
    that can effectively control F. necrophorum under rumen-like conditions, and which
    will be further tested in animal studies.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory
    mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
    intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in improving the quality of general and task lighting and reducing the amount of wasted light, thus reducing energy consumption. Solid state lighting has caused a paradigm shift in the lighting industry. However, the rapid growth of the LED has surpassed our understanding of its effects on human health and productivity, as well as the environment. Developing systems that put light only where it is needed can reduce energy consumption and improve well-being by eliminating glare and wasted light. Full control over where artificial lights shine may also reduce the disruption of natural ecosystems and agriculture caused by light pollution.? Unfortunately, a compact and low-cost solution to spatially controllable illumination is not available. Should one be brought to market, the industry could be tailored to meet the needs of each street lamp, each office worker and the entertainment industry among others. The ubiquitous nature of artificial illumination provides a unique commercial opportunity with multiple market segments for growth potential.

    The proposed project will focus on a microsystems solution to steerable lighting using a low-power, low-cost, silicon-based mirror less than 1 mm in diameter. The mirror is capable of real-time adjustments that will steer incident light with significant angular range. It is controlled using digital electronics and easily combined with traditional smart home electronics. The objective of the research is to measure the optical output of varying system setups and optical components to determine what optics are necessary for proper light output shape, uniformity, and color temperature. The project will rely heavily on a combination of test measurements and simulations to cycle through experiments rapidly and efficiently in order to converge on a manufacturing plan.

    This SBIR Phase I project aims to demonstrate the technical feasibility of a first-of-its-kind injectable gel for treating osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis, a disease of the body's joints, affects greater than 27 million Americans, and the proposed activity will de-risk the proprietary gel technology to warrant continued development of a medical device for treating osteoarthritis. The product is a bioinspired polymer gel solution, to be administered by injection into the joint, which will lubricate, cushion, and protect the joint's cartilage from wear, and thereby slow the progression of osteoarthritis. Upon successful completion of this project, the company aims to complete the preclinical and clinical studies required to gain regulatory approval for the product emanating from the proposed activity. From this project, a deeper fundamental understanding of body-biomaterial interactions will be gained, benefiting engineers, clinicians, and ultimately patients. The anticipated commercial success of this product will result in job creation both before and after completion of product development. As joint pain is one of the leading causes of missed work, disability, and general depreciation of quality of life, successful completion of the proposed high-technical-risk project will lay the foundation for development of an impactful medical device which will treat the highly prevalent disease osteoarthritis.

    The innovation of this project's technology lies in the patented synthetic techniques and composition of a tissue-protective gel solution that remains in the joint capsule at therapeutic concentrations for significantly longer than current injectable gels remain. All injectable viscoelastics approved in the United States for treating osteoarthritis are comprised of hyaluronic acid, a biopolymer which degrades rapidly upon injection; in contrast, the product in this project uses a synthetic, bioinspired polymer which resists degradation and maintains effective viscoelastic properties for four months, whereas current products' viscoelasticity is degraded after one week. The project's first objective will, through a radiolabeled biodistribution study, ascertain the gel's distribution throughout the body following injection into rodent knees, to demonstrate 100% clearance out of the animal and no accumulation within any tissues or organs. The project's second objective will develop the material processing techniques and syringe filling protocol for formulating the gel into its final product form and ensuring product performance and safety specifications are met. Completion of these objectives will allow product to be made under FDA-compliant Design Control for a pivotal large animal study to be conducted following this project, along with completion of formal biocompatibility testing for submission to FDA to seek approval for a First-in-Human clinical trial.

    The broader impact / commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to enable electrification of remote oil & gas processes to reduce methane emissions, improve on-site safety, and provide leak-detection and monitoring capabilities. This will be achieved by developing a robust, efficient, small-scale power generator capable of converting on-site fuel to electricity. Beyond the entry opportunity in the oil & gas sector, this technology has other applications in large markets such as residential and commercial power generation and heating, transportation, and military. For example, our proposed generators would allow consumers in moderate/cold climates to efficiently match their time-dependent heating and electrical demands using natural gas (accessible to 70 million households). For a typical household in those regions, we estimate a 45% reduction in primary energy use and CO2 emissions by deploying our generators. The energy reduction translates to an annual savings of about $650 per household. Widespread deployment of our technology would grow the domestic natural gas economy, strengthen the US technological lead in semiconductor manufacturing, and facilitate renewables by providing a dispatchable supply.?

    The proposed project will investigate the fundamental heat-to-electric conversion process and address key issues around the stability and robustness of the technology, through a synergistic effort to develop generators capable of high performance and a manufacturing process to reduce cost. The project will focus on device optimization and durability, and process repeatability. This involves the fabrication and integration of multiple frequency-selective components including a thermal emitter, optical filter, photovoltaic cell, and back surface reflector. Each component, as well as the integrated system, will undergo rigorous thermal testing to prove both resistance to elevated temperatures and temperature swings. Additionally, novel manufacturing techniques will be developed to enable cost-competitive devices relative to conventional generators. If the technical objectives are met, this project will demonstrate record-breaking performance for thermophotovoltaics and accelerate the commercialization of thermophotovoltaic devices in many different markets.?

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer(STTR) project is to develop a bio-based manufacturing process for glucaric acid and its intermediate, glucuronic acid. Microbial fermentation represents an attractive option for production of fuels and valuable chemicals from renewable resources, and glucaric acid can be produced from glucose, a renewable biomass-derived resource.  The glucaric acid market was estimated at $550M in 2016, and has a plethora of uses ranging from detergents to food ingredients, corrosion inhibitors, and de-icing applications.  The proposed project will engineer improved productivity of the microbe using C5/C6 sugars, thus accelerating the production of low-cost, high-purity glucaric acid. Achieving these bioprocess improvements will facilitate widespread adoption of bio-based glucaric acid in a variety of markets, broadening opportunity for US products. These applications include coatings, foams and foaming aids, electrolytes, gels, polymers, and polymer additives.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to perform multi-omics studies to characterize the physiology of E. coli strains producing glucaric acid via fermentation, and develop strain engineering strategies to enable high yield and productivity. Most fermentation products are highly reduced compared to the starting sugar, and care must be taken to maintain cells in a reduced state, meaning high NADH/NAD ratio, to drive the NADH-consuming biosynthetic reactions. Products that are derived from sugar oxidation, in contrast, pose a much different challenge, and have been explored to a much lesser extent. Here, additional oxygen is needed to accept the excess electrons generated during glucose oxidation. It is well known that both S. cerevisiae and E. coli, two of the most common organisms for industrial application, are limited in their electron transport chain capacity, resulting in overflow products from high glucose uptake rates. Regardless of the oxygen transfer ability of the fermentation equipment, there is an inherent maximum production rate of these organisms. In this project, the plan is to develop E. coli strains with increased respiration capacity, thus increasing the maximum glucose oxidation rate. Glucaric acid, which can be produced from glucose via 3 enzymatic reaction steps, is an exemplary product.

    finding a practical and cost-effective protective cap for baseball pitchers susceptible
    to serious head injuries from impacts of batted baseballs. The new cap design
    satisfactorily addresses the shortcomings of previous commercialization efforts
    that were unable to meet the prescribed protective requirements; failed to pass
    both the players' fashion expectations and comfort evaluation; and carried a hefty
    purchase price. The acceptance and use of the new cap by professional baseball
    players will create widespread demand from collegiate, high school and Little
    League players, a market that is estimated to generate annual revenues of more
    than $18M. These market projections exclude consideration of the technology's
    Broader Impact potential in other sports or vocational and military applications,
    where there is a growing recognition of the need for improved head protection
    for athletes, soldiers, law enforcement officials and construction workers. Sports
    injuries are now highly scrutinized, especially those causing long-term medical
    issues from brain injury, blunt force trauma and repetitive concussive injury.
    The societal value of this innovation will be found in safer sports and work environments.
    Such equipment represents a rapidly growing segment of the apparel market and
    a unique commercial opportunity for the company. \n\nThe intellectual merit of
    this project is based on the company's patented design that provides head protection
    from the impact of a baseball. The novelty of the protective cap headliner is
    its flexible outer hard shell made with highly rigid interconnecting truncated
    icosahedron panels. This allows the headliner to conform to the shape of the head
    while maintaining the stiffness needed to diffuse impact loads.  Since the impact
    of a baseball represents a short duration point load, the energy-absorbing capacity
    of the layer beneath the outer shell can be minimized. The objective is to identify
    the material characteristics required to dissipate the impact load associated
    with a Severity Index of 1200 or greater when a head-form is struck by a baseball
    traveling at speeds up to 125 mph; and to identify the material combination(s)
    best suited to achieve this goal. Traditional foam materials as well as state-of-the-art
    material compositions will be used in unique configurations to produce solutions
    that are not too heavy, not too bulky nor too hot to wear. The outcomes of this
    study will determine the availability of materials that can be used within the
    ergonomic and mechanical constraints of the patented design to protect the head.\n\nThis

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the first time commercial development of a copper cable which can transmit and store energy. Currently, copper cables are used for transmitting electricity. Adding energy storage capability to these cables is transformative and has the potential to be employed in a myriad of electrical and electronic applications. Making these cables into spools of wires and custom sliced into a certain length to achieve a required capacitance will be very attractive to commercial applications. The proposed study enables to understand how energy transmission and storage can be simultaneously performed without mutual interference. These cables can find niche applications in the automotive, energy, defense, and IT industries. Moreover, when made into thin wires, it can be weaved into a matrix which can be used to charge wearable devices. For example, currently, a soldier carries about 30-40 pounds of battery for a three-day mission. However, if energy storage devices like the one proposed here can be made into an advanced textile form and can be worn as a uniform, the weight currently carried by the soldiers can be considerably reduced. A cable energy storage device developed can also be beneficial for storing energy for clean-energy technologies such as wind and solar.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project fills the gap of a cable-type capacitor which saves space and fits well with electrical and electronic devices. The objective of this proposal is to use nanotechnology-based fabrication techniques to grow nanowhiskers with a high surface area on a copper cable to make cable-type capacitors. These nanostructures considerably enhance the surface area necessary for the storage of electrical charges. Since nanostructures are developed only on the outside of the electrical cable to store energy, the inner part of the cable can still be used for electrical transmission. The focus of the proposed research is to develop the processes which can be used to make these nanostructured electrodes into a cable capacitor. The fabrication techniques for growing nanostructures will be so designed that making long lengths of the cables are feasible. The performance of the cable-based capacitors will be tested in terms of capacitance, cycle life, voltage output, etc. In addition, the flexibility of the cable will be tested at different bend-angles to evaluate its applications in flexible energy storage applications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project include enabling the minimally invasive treatment of a large variety of conditions. This is expected to be achieved through the development of a steerable needle that can reach arbitrary positions in the human body that are not reachable by a straight needle from a simple needle hole. The long term impact of the proposed technology is in targeted delivery of medicine, or the removal of tissue such as biopsies, or treatment mechanisms such as ablation devices. An overarching goal of the proposed project is the availability of minimally invasive procedures that can replace more drastic surgery options. The development of this device has the potential to also save lives, treating what otherwise would be inoperable conditions due to the location of tumors blocked by sensitive organs or bones.


    The proposed project, if successful, will lead to demonstrating the application of a device that utilizes the buckling behavior of semi-curved beams to controllably alter the stiffness in a needle for cancer treatment and measure its efficacy in terms of the advantages over straight needles. The objectives of this research include: developing a prototype and match to surgeon use cases (interventional radiologist) and testing and characterizing the steerability performance while delivering the medical payload. Specifically, it is expected that the first therapeutic application of this technology will be microwave ablation of cancer tumors.

    This SBIR Phase I project will study the development of a digitally configurable shape around which a shoe can be created. The results of this project will enable the mass-customization of shoes so they can precisely fit the feet of the individuals who wear them. Properly fitting shoes are intended to improve the quality of life of customers through reduced pain and improved musculoskeletal health. This development in shoe-making technology is of broad interest to the population of the United States, but particularly important to women, who often suffer from physical deformities and injuries caused by ill-fitting shoes. The proposed innovation relies on mass-customization methods and flexible robotics technology. Its anticipated success will provide additional jobs in the shoe industry and related fields, and improve productivity nationwide through reduced healthcare costs.


    The strong technical innovation in this project will be the adaptation of granular jamming technology for use in programmable shape technology. The driving goal of the proposed project is to develop a last for use in the mass-customization of shoes that is capable of changing shape in response to a digital representation of the customer's foot shape. After changing shape, it will lock into a rigid but smooth form appropriate for use in traditional shoe manufacturing methods. The scope of the research will cover the development of the last in a manner appropriate for use in manufacturing conditions (in terms of both physical and temperature durability) and the creation and implementation of algorithms for transforming foot shape data into an appropriately fitting shoe shape and for transforming a standard shoe pattern onto an arbitrary foot shape. Iterative design practices and just-in-time manufacturing techniques will facilitate the development of this new technology and manufacturing methodology.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to democratize access to scientific techniques in vehicle energy modeling, making them intuitively available to all car buyers across the country. Unfortunately, the typical car buyer does not currently have access to information to determine their fuel consumption, costs, and range viability for different vehicles they may be considering for purchase on their own driving conditions. Further, car buyers typically do not have measurements of their mobility patterns in their current vehicle, making it further difficult to compare cars. Thus, car buyers have limited ability to understand the economic value in choosing a fuel-efficient vehicle which may cost more upfront but save them significant money in the long run. By providing greater access to information on the fuel consumption and costs that car buyers will experience in any vehicle they are considering, this project can accelerate the uptake of fuel-efficient vehicles. By accelerating the uptake of fuel-efficient cars, the team projects this project can enable up to 30-50 billion gallons of avoided petroleum use, and up to $450-680 billion of avoided fueling costs.

    This SBIR Phase 1 project proposes to apply data science, machine learning, and convex optimization techniques to develop and apply vehicle energy models in circumstances where only sparse and disparate sources of data are available. These circumstances represent use cases that are typically encountered by the vast majority of car buyers. To overcome the challenges posed by only sparse and disparate sources of data being available during the car comparison process for car buyers, this project will develop techniques for formulation and calibration of vehicle energy models using time-resolved, trip-resolved, and tank-resolved fuel consumption data. Further, this project will develop probabilistic techniques for trip profile generation to create speed/terrain profiles for given trips using origin-destination-departure time data or intermittent measurements of speed-position along a trip. These probabilistic techniques for trip profile generation can be combined with vehicle energy models to allow car buyers to compare any car they are considering for purchase, on their own driving conditions. The techniques developed will be made available for use by car buyers through implementation in a smartphone app and web-based tools that are easy and intuitive for car buyers to use during their car shopping process.

    Research (SBIR) project is to create transparency around the business logic used
    by stakeholders in the healthcare system to make transactional decisions as well
    as create alignment around the current status of healthcare transactions that
    are part of the work in process. To most people who interact with the healthcare
    system, it functions more or less as a \"black box\" with decisions that sometimes
    defy logic and common sense. Our goal is to use Blockchain and Machine Learning
    technology to convert this \"black box\" into a \"glass box.\" The commercial
    impact of this project could be an up to 25% reduction in claims processing costs
    for healthcare providers by the elimination of redundant work, re-work and errors.
    \n\nThis STTR Phase 1 project proposes two innovations: 1) claims transaction
    and reason codes managed through a Blockchain so that Providers and Payers can
    confidently know the accurate status of a claim, and 2) sophisticated statistical
    and deep learning algorithms for predicting the likelihood of a claim denial with
    natural language processing of associated notes and appeals. Our product is a
    mathematically driven software service that utilizes and innovates with multiple
    technologies: Blockchain distributed ledgers, smart contracts and tokens, and
    prediction, recommendation, forecasting, non-linear optimization and natural language
    processing engines within a privacy-preserving data management system.\n\nThis

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase 1 Project will seek to solve the problem of how to
    incorporate a new and standardized approach to computer science instructional
    modeling experiences for students using a combination of video training, instructional
    materials, and assessment materials that can be accessed by teachers from an online
    platform. Models that simulate realistic behavior are usually inherently complex
    using mathematics such as calculus or differential equations. As a result, many
    teachers do not recognize the many possible ways that these models can be developed
    on spreadsheet programs. While teachers and students already can access and have
    baseline familiarity with spreadsheets, there exists many new computational modeling
    applications that can fundamentally change the nature of the way students learn
    Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) as separate subjects by unifying
    them into one instructional modeling experience. This project will develop and
    investigate methods of training inexperienced teachers in computational spreadsheet
    modeling that are designed to enable easy to follow pathways for teachers to deliver
    spreadsheet modeling experiences to their students with in-person training or
    having to develop and test their own student experiences. This will serve to expand
    the use of computer science in classrooms in compliance with the Next Generation
    Science Standards (NGSS) and open the realistic modeling capability intrinsic
    to calculus and differential equations, to high school students while exclusively
    using algebraic equations. Teachers will also be able to contribute newly developed
    ideas for authorship credit and compensation. \n\n\nThis proposal will seek to
    develop, adapt, and assess the effectiveness of an inexpensive video-based demonstration
    and teacher training regimen that is intended to make delivering this instructional
    methodology to students happen quickly, efficiently and become self-sourcing by
    teachers from many different schools. This will be done by automating the training
    to keep cost to a minimum and maximize teacher time savings and the value added
    to the student instructional experience of computational modeling on a spreadsheet.
    For typical spreadsheet modeling objective students follow procedures employing
    numerical methods (such as slope of lines, areas of trapezoids, difference equations,
    Euler's Method) incrementally over large numbers of cells (102-104) to build a
    realistic mathematical model on a spreadsheet. By doing this, the error associated
    with the numerical approach drops well below the error associated with model assumptions
    making it possible to model non-ideal continually changing variables with linearity
    assumptions. The computational power of the spreadsheet enables instantaneous
    replication of the linearized formulas, which when pattered properly with fixed
    and relative references, can produce pivot tables in which variables can be altered
    by students using inquiry and curiosity to investigate a model that they programmed
    starting from a blank spreadsheet. By building from a variety of curriculum aligned
    applications and crafting the instructional experience using a carefully tested
    pedagogy, teachers will be provided with high value skills to pass on to their
    students, so they will be able to first program, then simulate, experiment and
    solve problems on a variety of new quantitative spreadsheet modeling scenarios
    in STEM classes.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase 1 project will advance technology to significantly
    improve the standard of care within corrective surgery for spinal deformity. Approximately
    55,000 patients with spinal deformity seek improvement in their reduced quality
    of life through surgery each year in the US. The goal of these surgeries is to
    mechanically adjust and fix the spine into a biomechanically balanced position.
    \ It is common for surgeons to plan these intensive surgeries before the operation.
    \ However, the operating room environment introduces many challenges that make
    it difficult for the surgeon to measure the contour of the patient's spine as
    it changes during surgery.  Current commercial offerings rely on radiation-based
    imaging which involves significant operative delays, ionizing radiation exposure,
    and narrow 2-dimensional fields of view.  These suboptimal solutions contribute
    to the high rates of continued postoperative deformity along with the need for
    repeated surgeries. This project focuses on the development of imaging technology
    that will enable real-time, 3D, whole-spine assessments of a patient's spinal
    alignment with significant reduction in both time per alignment assessment and
    radiation exposure compared to current standards. By providing real-time, quantitative
    feedback to surgeons during these cases, the technology stands to greatly improve
    surgical outcomes and reduce the need for repeat operations. \n\nThis project
    repurposes the functionality of an off-the-shelf optical tracking system by coupling
    it with novel hardware and software registration algorithms.  When coupled with
    these enhancements, the camera system will enable rapidly-generated, quantitative
    measurements of a patient's spine while in the operating room.  By leveraging
    technology that is already present in the majority of surgical centers, the path
    to commercialization for this innovation is greatly accelerated. This removes
    the need for most centers to purchase additional capital equipment, while also
    integrating seamlessly into a system that is familiar to many surgeons. The expansion
    of this high-precision technology will also enable more data-driven and patient-specific
    decisions to be made for a variety of surgeries The project is led by a multidisciplinary
    team of scientists, engineers, and world-class neurosurgeons with experience in
    translating medical devices into impactful commercial products. The aims within
    this project include the development of novel tracking-system augmentation hardware,
    image-analysis algorithms, optimization of accuracy via benchtop testing, and
    validation via testing with cadaveric specimens.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's

    This SBIR Phase 1 project will study how communications feedback loops effect online learning, especially in group settings. The explosion of online learning experiences in recent years, in which many courses fail to engage learners or help them achieve their academic and professional goals, has put focus on the problem of engagement. Interest in online learning remains high, as it presents an opportunity to broaden the reach of institutions and companies, but success rates in broadly available learning experiences are low. Built upon foundational research in computational social science, the project will use specialized video and text chat tools to collect data from groups engaged in synchronous online learning, analyze and categorize patterns of communication, and give feedback to students to help them have better, more successful experiences online. In keeping with NSF's mission to promote the progress of science and advance national welfare, the project applies emerging innovations in artificial intelligence to the problem of delivering high-quality learning at scale. While most applications focus on individual learners and creating new personalized educational pathways, this project highlights the importance of collective learning and the power of peer engagement to help all members of a learning community reach their goals together.


    This project introduces several innovations in data capture and analytics, as well as feedback to learners while they are collaborating online. While many students use online collaboration tools such as discussion boards, chat, and video, this project focuses on providing interventions to change behavior in real-time. During conversations, such as those happening when people brainstorm to solve a problem or work on shared assignments, certain vocal patterns indicate engagement, reveal unstated agreements and discords, and expose individual biases. Using deep learning and data modeling, real-time feedback about conversational dominance is generated and shown to learners while they are speaking. The project further explores the effect of machine-generated insights about what happened during the collaboration, and makes recommendations about behavior modifications, based on predictive models. For more nuanced insights, these data are paired with facial-gestural data, such as nodding or raising one?s eyebrows. Together, these innovations combine data that has never been collected at scale before with social science data models uniquely applied to online learning. The goal of the research project is to prove that insights like these have a net positive effect on learning outcomes and raise the level of satisfaction with online learning experiences that incorporate these tools.

    The broader impact/commercial impact of this proposal is to reduce fraud in telecommunications.  Americans received approximately 26 billion so-called "robocalls" last year, and in March 2019, a new monthly record of 5 billion robocalls was reached, according to the FCC. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) reports the agency is on pace to receive 5+ million complaints about robocalls in 2019, a 30% increase over 2018. Robocalling scammers rely on relatively cheap technology that works on a large scale, and new schemes are getting smarter and pose a growing threat. Significantly, robocallers leverage artificial intelligence (A.I.), synthesized voice (so-called "deep fakes"), and caller ID spoofing, creating fraud of over $22 billion annually.  This proposed project will work to reduce robocalls and associated fraud by filtering at the telecommunications device level.

    The proposed innovation leverages new decentralized ledger technology with blockchain encryption, real-time parsing of records, and real-time machine algorithms to block robocalls and reduce connection delays. The goal of the proposed innovation is to dramatically reduce the volume of fraudulent phone calls.  This SBIR proposal focuses on filtering at the device level; initially applied to prevent robocalls, but potentially relevant for other secure applications.  The innovation leverages blockchain's shared storage and memory, ability to operate in a "trustless environment" (due to lack of cross-telecom network collaboration on centralized robocall lists), as well as advances in blockchain encryption, artificial intelligence and machine learning, and real-time parsing of records and machine algorithms to block robocalls and reduce connection delays.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this STTR project is to develop a novel drug delivery system composed of peptide-loaded hydrogel nanoparticles for targeted and sustained therapeutic peptide release to the intestine. The gastrointestinal system and gut microbiome have emerged as critical drivers of human health, offering new opportunities to treat diseases such as food allergies, fungal infections, inflammatory bowel disease, and hyperoxaluria. However, a new class of drug systems are required to target the local biology of these diseases. The first indication pursued is hyperoxaluria and associated recurrent kidney stones and kidney diseases. With over ~27M calcium oxalate kidney stone (KS) patients in the U.S. (affecting 1 in 5 men and 1 in 11 women) and even higher global incidence, KS is a healthcare epidemic with no effective medication. Recent discoveries at the University of Chicago revealed the opportunity to treat hyperoxaluria through novel peptides that require local action in the intestine. Thus, a unique peptide-loaded hydrogel nanoparticle drug delivery system can enable a first-in-class therapeutic for the millions of patients with hyperoxaluria. More importantly, this drug system opens the door for additional orally administered, locally delivered, peptide therapeutics for other difficult gastrointestinal conditions, creating substantial healthcare and economic gains.

    This STTR project is developing an innovative drug delivery system consisting of peptide-loaded hydrogel nanoparticles (PLHN) as a vehicle to deliver novel peptides to the intestinal epithelium, ultimately enabling a first-in-class oral pill to prevent and treat hyperoxaluria and related kidney stones (KS). Once delivered, the nanoparticles will adhere to the intestinal mucosa and slowly release the peptides, stimulating intestinal oxalate secretion, thereby lowering plasma and urine oxalate and hence preventing KS formation. Such delivery will enable peptides to immediately act on the intestinal epithelium to induce oxalate secretion, before being degraded by proteolytic enzymes, mimicking the behavior of a gut bacteria, from which peptides were derived. Research objectives are: 1. Develop PLHN for sustained and localized delivery of peptides to the intestinal epithelium. Peptide release kinetics will be quantified to ensure a 4-week release duration. 2. Show that the PLHN, given rectally as enemas and orally by gavage, will deliver the peptides to the intestinal epithelium in a localized/sustained manner, and that they will significantly reduce plasma and urine oxalate levels in hyperoxalemic and hyperoxaluric mice. Showing dosing once every 3 days similarly reduces urine and plasma oxalate levels compared to twice daily dosing will demonstrate sustained releasability.

- abstractText: "Bag-valve masks are simple, squeezable tools for manual ventilation
    of patients and are the most common manual method used in both emergencies and
    routine surgical procedures. The simplicity and minimal cost of BVMs have contributed
    to their widespread use and sales of approximately 13.1 million disposable resuscitators
    annually in the U.S. alone. Despite the regular use of BVMs, providers of any
    training level regularly deliver ineffective ventilation or uncontrolled, inadvertent,
    forced over-inflation. Studies show that, while using a standard BVM, 88.4% of
    trained users exceeding the recommended pressure and 73.8% exceeding the recommended
    volume range2 Improper ventilation for even short periods can lead to two major
    complications 1) Lung injury from over-stretching (called volutrauma); too much
    air and 2) Lung injury from over-pressurization (called barotrauma); too much
    pressure. These conditions can lead to life-threatening conditions as well as
    prolonged and expensive hospital stays with costs approaching $170,000 (CAD) per
    injury. \n\nWhen used in emergency situations, execution of proper BVM technique
    is required to provide optimal oxygenation during CPR. Devices to monitor the
    depth and rate of CPR compressions are widely available and are soon to be required
    in all training centers by the AHA.  However, no technologies exist to provide
    similar feedback for manual ventilation. It is likely that real-time feedback
    can reduce or eliminate the rate of dangerous ventilation among caregivers of
    all levels and that BVM training with feedback can lead to improved skill retention.
    Thus, a novel  technique and complementary device have been developed to provide
    real time feedback to trained and training personnel and ensure they meet guidelines
    from the American Heart Association (AHA) and European Resuscitation Council (ERC).
    This project is a comprehensive system development pathway composed of three aims
    that will refine our sensor system and initiate studies into the benefits of real-time
    feedback during BVM usage. This method utilizes a unique sensor system that can
    be coupled to a bag valve mask to measure the air pressure and volume delivered
    to a patient. Using these metrics for each squeeze of the bag, this device can
    alert users of both excessive pressure and volume in real time.\n\nThis award
    reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
    evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
    criteria."
