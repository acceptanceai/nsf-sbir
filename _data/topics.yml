    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project seeks to create an ultra-high-speed variable focus optical element meeting the robust performance needs associated with laser manufacturing.  The ability to change the focal spot location in laser processing is necessary to accommodate the rapid throughput and complex materials shapes and structures generally encountered in industrial manufacturing.  However, the state-of-the-art remains slow, mechanically moving lenses, which can lead to increased production times, reduced accuracy, increased system complexity and overall increased cost.  Instead, this work proposes a paradigm-shifting approach to variable focus by developing a new type of liquid lens that uses sound to shape and refocus light.  In order to implement this rapidly growing, high impact technology in the manufacturing arena, the key challenge is to manage and reduce laser heating of the device which can lead to undesirable optical effects.  By using a combination of experimental tests and numerical models we expect to determine the optimum design conditions that minimize heating effects and maximize refractive power of the lens. With the inclusion of passive and active cooling approaches we expect to enable lens operation for production-level laser manufacturing across different power and pulse duration scales.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will have significant repercussions in the laser manufacturing industry, an increasingly important industry which is in many ways responsible for the efficiency and economical cost of every day materials and devices.  Specifically, this project addresses a technological market need which will reduce the manufacturing cycle, and streamline processes by providing additional control of the laser beam in the z axis without effecting the x and y axis resolution; thereby, improving the manufacturing yield by increasing the precision, and speed of laser manufacturing systems. Improvements in manufacturing yield are incredibly important to both societal and environmental conditions as they lead to a reduction in waste, an increase in the quality of the parts produced, and a reduction in manufacturing costs. Additionally this proposal will increase scientific and technical understanding on how to applying ultra-high speed z-scanning optical devices in high power lasers systems for manufacturing operation.  This will not only lead to the incorporation of such devices in already existing systems but more importantly, enable new innovations such as the creation of entirely new manufacturing approaches with increased performance and capabilities.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in developing the world?s first ultra-high-speed variable focus optical lens that can be fully mass-produced with low manufacturing costs and high yield. The company?s proprietary tunable acoustic gradient lens technology provides versatile solutions for unmet market needs across multiple sectors, including health, security, and manufacturing. While valuable as an add-on to existing systems for imaging and processing applications, its use can be extended to other applications such as point of care medical diagnostic imaging and consumer optics/electronics.  The proposed second generation lens is expected to grow the existing market for variable focus optical lens by a factor of 5 to 10 and help transform this small business into a major original equipment components manufacturer and supplier.


    This project seeks to engineer a high volume manufacturing process that will increase product yield, reproducibility, and reliability for a novel ultra-high-speed variable focus device.  The company?s patented tunable acoustic gradient lens technology uses sound to shape light, which enables the change of focal position without any moving parts at rates that are 3 orders of magnitude faster than competing technologies.  The innovation is based on propagation of sound waves that can be controlled by the modification of the index of refraction by piezoelectric elements within the liquid lens. Phase II plan is focused on engineering and optimizing new lens designs that preserve the fundamental functionality and benefits of the first generation lens while also capturing the unique and industry leading benefits of the company's core technology. It also includes semi-automated prototype fabrication, careful system optimization, analysis and testing that pave  the path to a next generation product that can be scaled up for mass-production.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses two roadblocks to reducing the cost of wind energy: the labor-intensive construction process, and size limitations imposed by road or rail transport for turbine components. The former issue drives up manufacturing costs and reduces US competitiveness with countries with inexpensive labor, while the latter forces sub-optimized tower designs and prevents turbines from growing larger and taking advantage of faster, steadier winds at higher hub heights. This project addresses both of these problems by adapting spiral welding - a well understood system for pipe and piling manufacturing - to wind tower production. Spiral welding is highly automated, requiring as little as 10% of the labor of the equivalent manual process. It also combines multiple operations into a single machine that can be operated on-site, eliminating transport costs and barriers. This project's innovation is to adapt existing spiral welders - which can manufacture only straight, constant wall-thickness pipe - to producing tapered, variable wall thickness towers. A novel material geometry and automated control of machine parameters are the keys to transforming the standard system to one optimized for turbine tower production. With on-site spiral welding of turbine towers, significant reductions in cost of wind energy are possible.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be felt in many areas: technical, commercial and environmental. The system?s major contribution is an increase in the use of wind energy for US electricity, enabled by both reduction in energy cost and increase in the number of cost effective wind sites. Reducing the cost of tall towers enables increases in the height and size of wind turbines, allowing them to reach and be optimized for steadier, higher speed winds. With these increase in size and optimization, decreases in cost of wind energy of 12% (for 120m tall towers) or more are possible. In addition, the US land area for which wind energy is cost effective can be doubled at 120m hub heights. Spiral-welding of turbine towers also provides US jobs and increases American competitiveness with overseas producers. Because on-site production is inherently local, manufacturing jobs are created in the communities where wind turbines are installed. Also, this method gives local production a major cost advantage over imports by producing towers that are too large to transport from port to wind farm. This allows domestic manufacturing to not only compete, but dominate in a domestic tower market worth roughly $1B in 2011.

    generating electricity from waste heat, e.g., from vehicle exhausts and factories.
    \ The low efficiency (measured by ZT) of presently used thermoelectric materials

    of pnictogen chalcogenides with ZT ~ 1.  Our materials synthesis and processing
    scale up efforts will be guided by thermoelectric property measurements and materials
    characterization. The structure-processing-property correlations unearthed during
    our studies will identify the synthesis and processing parameters needed to retain
    the high ZT during scale-up, and will provide clues to further increase ZT (e.g.,

    cooling or power generation.  Thermoelectric materials already represent a billion-dollar

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project searches for better materials to efficiently and safely store gases used in semiconductor manufacturing. Currently these gases are stored in tanks at low pressures in dilute concentrations for safety reasons, which requires the use of many tanks that need to be frequently refilled. This increases the cost of semiconductor manufacturing which drives up the cost of consumer electronics. Porous materials, which soak up gases like bath sponges soak up water, can be used to store these gases in larger concentrations while maintaining safety. However, the number of porous materials that we can use to potentially store these gases is enormous (i.e., hundreds of millions) and so quickly finding the best material requires advanced computational screening methods. This project will computationally generate millions of hypothetical porous materials and screen them for their ability to store gases used in semiconductor manufacturing at industrially relevant temperatures and pressures. The computationally screening data will be used to synthesize and test an optimal material in the laboratory, which could subsequently be manufactured at larger scale.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be the cheaper production of electronics and a safer working environment in semiconductor manufacturing facilities. This will open the door to designing porous materials for other gas storage applications in such areas such as adsorptive heat exchange, carbon capture, and commodity gas transportation. Even more broadly, the successful determination of an optimal material via large-scale computational screening will further validate the utility of ?big data? in the modern scientific enterprise.

    Gas Storage'
- abstractText: |-
    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in the development of a new hazardous gas storage and delivery system for semiconductor fabrication that will significantly promote worker health and safety benefits at a reduced cost. The new system incorporates a new class of ultra-high performing absorbents, namely Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs), that will greatly mitigate the environmental and public health risks by reducing incidents of toxic gas release, chances of equipment damage, and fabrication facility evacuation. Moreover, the use of MOFs enables an increase in the storage capacity while providing savings in ventilation energy, and reducing the risk of leakages over both high pressure mechanical cylinders and sub-atmospheric carbon-based storage. Given the current vast market share of activated carbon cylinders, the higher capacity MOF filled cylinders offer the prospect of substantial decreased in per wafer production costs by minimizing gas cylinder change-outs and fabrication facility downtime. Furthermore, this technology represents the first large scale commercial application for MOFs, thus opening the doors for this promising class of materials for other gas storage applications.



    This project aims to increase the capacity of gas cylinders for the storage and delivery of highly toxic gases, such as arsine (AsH3), phosphine (PH3), and boron trifluoride (BF3), that are commonly used in semiconductor fabrication.  As a safety measure, these highly toxic gases are currently stored at low pressure in activated carbon-filled cylinders. However, the capacity of activated carbon adsorbents is severely limited by their ill-defined internal pore structure. NuMat is developing higher capacity gas cylinders by focusing on the following key technical objectives: 1) Design highly porous, well-defined, crystalline MOF absorbents to be integrated into cylinders, allowing for high capacity storage of these highly toxic gases at sub-atmospheric pressures, 2) Develop industrially relevant MOF scale-up procedures to minimize the cost of production, 3) Maximize the volumetric storage of MOFs in cylinders by developing high density MOF pellets, and 4) Integrate high density MOF pellets into cylinders to displace the lower performing activated carbon filled cylinders currently used this commercial application. Additionally, the technical milestones achieved in this project will help to establish the necessary foundation for incorporating this class of ultra-high performing materials (MOFs) into other gas storage applications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in the availability of an additive manufacturing (3D printing) process suitable for full-scale building construction. The construction industry represents a critical nexus in the American economy. Building construction impacts nearly every economic sector, particularly manufacturing, transportation, energy, consumer products and appliances, and real estate. Simply, a building is perhaps the most essential economic stimulus there is. Yet, the practice of building has seen little of the technological revolution that has transformed virtually every other industry. As a result, the construction industry produces significant material and financial waste, and its productivity has steadily declined over the past several decades. Additive manufacturing is the most efficient and cost-effective approach to creating custom products, of which buildings are by far the most valuable and most widely purchased. Customization is increasingly driving demand by today?s consumers. Additive manufacturing in construction could reduce costs and material waste while providing unparalleled design freedom and driving innovation through the consolidation of many isolated industrial activities into one highly flexible and efficient manufacturing process, which directly serves industry professionals and clients at an individual level.

    The intellectual merit of this project stems from the vast potential of Additive Manufacturing to transform design and making. In a broad sense, the proposed method of construction aims to make the complexity, efficiency, and freedom of digital architectural design accessible to the average consumer. Phase I research will serve to scale and develop a new large-scale additive manufacturing process, and to evaluate the performance of the physical products in their functions as building components. The proposed method may potentially impact other types of large-scale manufacturing as well, including aerospace and automotive. Our technology is rooted in observations of the processes in which forms are created in the natural world. Structures in nature have long fascinated scientists and engineers, due to their remarkable efficiency and complex forms. 3D printing now allows us to manufacture products of similar efficiency and complexity which reflect our observations of nature. We believe that if the genius of natural organisms can be applied to the way we create shelter, provide transportation, design infrastructure, or construct cities, the resulting innovations could profoundly, and very literally, shape the way our societies develop, and transform our relationship with the natural world.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is in support of Branch Technology's novel Additive Manufacturing (AM) process that combines 3D printing technology and conventional construction materials to enable a new way to create buildings. The construction market in the US is approximately 8% of GDP.  Any portion of the market that could be enhanced would have a large impact in the US economy.  To that end, Branch is creating a process similar to building found in the natural world.  In the formation of natural systems, material is the most expensive commodity; a structure is derived by the efficient use of material, but shape is free to be created in almost any form.  Branch can approach this efficiency with additive manufacturing, where form is created and material is deposited only when needed and little waste is created. At the core of Branch's method of AM-based construction are three key developments: a three-dimensional freeform structure (the cellular matrix or lattice) which serves as a scaffold for other materials, a robotically- controlled extrusion mechanism by which the cellular matrix is produced, and the algorithms necessary to control the robot for successful production.  The proof of concept for this process and more have already been demonstrated by Branch in Phase I of this grant.

    The technical objectives for Phase II focus on improving the procedures and technology already created. The focus areas for this phase are algorithm development, hardware improvements, the application of finishing materials, code compliance testing, and material science experiments. Algorithm development consists of refining and creating the software necessary to extrude the printed matrix and support a client base. Hardware improvements are necessary to improve the speed and efficiency of the process to create a commercially viable workflow. This research will necessitate the purchase of extra hardware for experimentation.  American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) testing for load bearing capacity is necessary to enter the market and provide code compliant construction. Experimentation in the application of finished materials to the 3D printed lattice such as spray foam and concrete are vital to the realization of complete buildings.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate the technical and commercial viability of a high-brightness ultraviolet light-emitting diode (UVLED) system for inducing an involuntary avoidance response of birds and bats.  The purpose of this system is to reduce the mortality rates of birds and bats by deterring them from entering the active rotor zone area of an operating wind turbine and thus minimizing the risk of mortality or injury from direct collision or barotrauma.  Many avian and bat species have spectral sensitivity to ultraviolet light and are known to react to signal colors and bright light sources, whereas humans do not have spectral sensitivity to ultraviolet light and would not have an overall awareness to the operation of a UVLED system.  Strict regulations for species protection by the Endangered Species Act as well as general bird and bat mortality are guiding the permitting approval process for siting new wind farms (both on land and off-shore) and the operations of existing wind farms.

    The broader/commercial potential of this project is that it addresses a major problem affecting the permitting of new and existing wind farms.  In addition, there are other numerous additional potential applications for the UVLED system.  These applications include protecting airports? landing and take-off airspaces from bird strikes; integrating UVLEDs into airplane landing lights to protect against bird strikes; mounting on radio/TV and other towers to minimize bird mortality; mounting on large buildings where bird mortality is known to be high; protecting tar pits and similar hazards from bird mortality; and protecting bridges, rooftops, and similar spaces from the nuisance of bird droppings.  Also, bats save farmers about $74 per acre by providing natural pest control.  Pest control services provided by insect-eating bats in the U.S. likely save the U.S. agricultural industry at least $3 billion a year.

- abstractText: "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project represents
    a new development in man?s ability to keep birds away from the airspace surrounding
    an airplane or out of the way of the massive rotors of wind turbines. Animals
    respond to a bright ultraviolet light in the same way as humans respond to a bright
    flashlight in their eyes. If the light is strong enough, it causes an involuntary
    behavioral response resulting in the animal being deterred from the area of the
    light source. Ultraviolet light has the advantage of being visible to most species
    of animals while being invisible to humans. This Phase II project builds on the
    Phase I project that demonstrated with 98% confidence that bird behavior is influenced
    by the presence of the wildlife deterrence system?s bright ultraviolet light in
    a completely natural environment with no human presence. \n\n\nThe broader impact/commercial
    potential of this project is focused on three high value applications of the wildlife
    deterrence system. They are renewable alternative energy (wind farms), air transportation
    (planes and airports), and agriculture (aquaculture and agriculture). Renewable
    energy is at the top of the U.S. priority list. Wind energy is one of the most
    promising forms of alternative energy. At the same time, there is an immediate
    and pressing need to reduce the mortality rate of endangered and protected species
    at wind farms. A compelling global need for the wildlife deterrence system is
    exemplified by the aviation industry and the incidence of bird strikes. The U.S.
    Department of Transportation Inspector General reported in August 2012 that in
    the past two decades, wildlife strikes have increased from 1,770 reported in 1990
    to 9,840 reported in 2011, a greater than five-fold increase. Thirdly, although
    not at the level of importance as protection of aircraft and deterrence of birds
    from wind farm turbine rotors, worldwide seafood demand has grown annually by
    8.3 percent since 1970. This means that worldwide aquaculture production has rapidly
    expanded. Of particularly promising potential are solutions to the mussel farming
    problems of the international aquaculture industry which is well established in
    many parts of the world. All producing locations in North America and Europe share
    a common problem of severe predation loss from diving ducks such as the Common
    Eider that can be devastating to the mussel producer, with the potential to wipe
    out an entire crop (100%)."

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II Project of ?No Heat Spray Drying? fundamentally changes the process of spray drying liquids to powders by eliminating the use of heat.  Typically, a liquid emulsion consists of a high value liquid ingredient that is emulsified with a carrier system that when dried captures the liquid ingredient in a powdered form.  High temperature spray drying remains the preferred method of drying many thermally sensitive materials such as foods, chemicals, probiotics, pharmaceuticals, and in many other applications where the production of a free-flowing powder is required.  The current spray drying process employs air heated up to 400° Fahrenheit to dry the liquid into a powder.  Exposing sensitive, volatile liquid ingredients to high temperatures causes molecular degradation that negatively impacts performance.  By eliminating the use of heat the end result is a significantly improved powder in terms of product quality, solubility, stability and overall performance.  Our research will be focused on improving our proprietary technology through dryer optimization and atomization development.  This research should yield an innovative, commercially viable ?no heat? spray drying technology with the ability to manufacture significant amounts of powdered products.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project spans markets including food & beverage, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, infant formula, coffee, vitamins and numerous other segments where the production of a free flowing powder ingredient is desired.  The challenge:  how to eliminate the use of heat in converting liquids to powders.  By eliminating the use of heat in the manufacturing process, we create significantly improved powder products.  Our process is more economical, delivers products with longer shelf life, better encapsulation and improves solubility. Our technology has several societal benefits including decreasing energy consumption and preventing the evaporation of volatile ingredients into the atmosphere.  Our technology may be able impact the bioavailability of drugs, decrease tablet sizes, deliver stable Omega 3 ingredients and improve dried milk powder.  We are only beginning to explore the potential applications of our revolutionary process technology

    to solve the problems of limited voltage, energy density, and lifetime in Electric
    Double Layer Capacitors (EDLCs). These issues have largely lead to the failure
    of EDLCs to become a significant part of the energy storage landscape. Over the
    years, many different efforts have focused on developing new carbon materials
    for EDLCs, including those focused on exotic and expensive materials such as carbon
    nanotubes, carbide derived carbons and Graphene.  None of these have so far succeeded
    at matching the energy density, lifetime, or voltage range of 15 year old commercial
    carbon materials. This project will attempt to prove that this is related to functional
    groups on the carbon surface that, when assembled in an EDLC and charged, are
    REDOX active to form water in the electrolyte. The objective of the research will
    be to eliminate these species and other surface functional groups, while maintaining
    the exceptionally high surface area necessary for high capacitance, through precisely
    controlled thermal treatment of activated carbon.  This will result in dramatic
    increases in the voltage, energy density, and life of current EDLC products. \n\nThe
    broader impact/commercial potential of this project will involve dramatically

    fact that this technology could eliminate the requirement for exotic and expensive
    precursors for carbon production, allowing, for the first time, the use of inexpensive
    water filtration carbons. The combined lower cost and improved performance would
    expand EDLCs use in applications like hybrid cars, buses, wind turbine pitch control

    Cost Activated Carbon Materials for Supercapacitors'
- abstractText: |-
    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in significantly increasing the ways supercapacitors and lithium ion batteries are used today.  Supercapacitors offer very high power capabilities and high energy efficiency and have been used in many renewable energy applications such as hybrid buses and wind turbines.  Currently, their use is limited due to high cost and low energy density relative to Li-ion batteries.  Coulometrics has developed a proprietary process that can modify low cost activated carbon materials into supercapacitor grade carbons with 25% higher energy density and twice the current lifespan of existing materials.   These critical developments will lower the overall system cost and improve cell life allowing for more widespread use of supercapacitors in renewable energy applications.  Coulometrics has also shown that a very similar process can be used to convert natural graphite to lithium ion grade anode materials with higher energy density and significantly lower cost.  This process will also enable a Northern American company to become the first producer of graphite for lithium ion batteries on the continent which can significantly reduce lithium ion battery cost for applications such as electric vehicles.   Both projects will have additional environmental benefits including reduced greenhouse gas emissions, less burning of fossil fuels, and help protect the environment.



    The project seeks to break through a significant barrier that has kept ultracapacitor voltage and energy density stagnant for over a decade and significantly reduce costs of lithium ion battery carbon materials.  Supercapacitor companies all produce products with different carbons, electrolytes, cell construction, etc. and yet are all confined to the same performance specifications. We believe that this is related to oxidation/reduction reactions that occur on the carbon surface; a fairly intuitive hypothesis; however attempts at solutions have been futile. The surface treatment we developed in Phase I has resulted in a reduction of these oxidation/reduction currents by more than 50%. This technology will lead to the largest performance gains in the ultracapacitor industry in over 10 years.  Additionally, one of the most challenging factors limiting market growth for ultracapacitors is their high cost, of which activated carbon accounts for 27%. Coulometrics' treatment applied to inexpensive water filtration carbon, also developed in Phase I, has shown very similar performance enhancements, and will cost up to 95% less than commercial activated carbon materials.  The surface modification process for graphitic carbons will enable the low cost and high quality production of carbon anode materials for lithium ion batteries based on natural graphite.  This breakthrough can significantly reduce lithium ion battery cost which is a key element for more wide spread adoption of electric vehicles which will help reduce our nation's dependence on the need to import foreign oil.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a novel soft magnetic material for electric motor cores, a fabrication process to make components from the material, and an electric motor configuration leveraging the benefits of the material and fabrication process. The approach is to utilize a new single-step net-shape fabrication technique based on uniform-droplet spray deposition in a reactive atmosphere to produce an isotropic metal microstructure characterized by small domains of high permeability and low coercivity with a controlled formation of insulation boundaries that limit electrical conductivity between neighboring domains.  This design is expected to provide a superior magnetic path while minimizing losses due to eddy currents, and eliminating design constraints associated with anisotropic laminated cores of conventional motors.

    The broader/commercial impact of this project will be the potential to provide spray-formed winding cores for hybrid-field motors to increase output, improve efficiency and reduce material scrap during fabrication, thus lowering the cost of electric motors. Considering the extensive use of electric motors in numerous applications, including industrial machinery and automation, robotics, heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems, appliances, power tools, medical devices, automotive applications, electric vehicles, military equipment etc., there is an increasing need for electric motors with improved performance, higher efficiency, and lower cost. This project is expected to have a significant commercial and environmental impact by providing low-cost and high-efficiency electric motor cores.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop a novel soft magnetic material and fabrication process for magnetic circuits of electric machines, such as winding cores of electric motors. The technology utilizes a unique single-step near net-shape fabrication process based on metal spray deposition to produce an isotropic metal microstructure characterized by small domains with high permeability, high saturation and low coercivity with a controlled formation of insulation boundaries that limit electric conductivity between neighboring domains. The resulting material provides an excellent three-dimensional magnetic path while minimizing energy losses associated with eddy currents. It can replace anisotropic laminated winding cores, which currently constrain the design of conventional electric motors to geometries with two-dimensional magnetic paths. As a further objective of the project, a new hybrid-field motor topology, with three-dimensional magnetic paths enabled by the proposed material and fabrication process, is being developed.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to enable production of electric motors with improved performance and efficiency while reducing cost and material scrap associated with manufacturing of motor winding cores. Electric motors are used extensively in a growing number of applications, including robotics, semiconductor and LED process equipment, industrial automation, electric vehicles, heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems, appliances, power tools, medical devices, and military and space exploration applications.  These markets drive an increasing demand for electric motors with improved performance, higher efficiency, and lower cost. Considering the extensive use of electric motors globally, the disruptive change resulting from the proposed hybrid-field motor technology with spray-formed winding cores is expected to provide significant commercial, societal and environmental benefits, including improved manufacturing efficiency, waste reduction, and energy conservation.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to develop a hydraulic regenerative shock absorber and charge system for hybrid trucks. An appreciable amount of energy is lost in a typical suspension as heat, especially in heavy vehicles. Existing technologies have been unable to efficiently capture this energy in a cost-effective manner. This project will entail the modeling, design, fabrication, and testing of a hydraulic-electric energy harvesting unit, along with the power electronics and energy storage subsystem to charge hybrid truck batteries. The objective of the project is to study and prove the feasibility of a regenerative shock absorber as a disruptive hydraulic energy harvesting mechanism on heavy trucks. Emphasis will be on the specific challenges of converting high force small amplitude oscillations into electricity that can interface with hybrid charge systems. Work will focus on a proof-of-concept demonstration and a determination of the increased efficiency possible on a hybrid vehicle using the internal piston/integrated-generator regenerative shock absorber mechanism.


    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is significant as the foundational technology can be applied to a wide range of vehicles, systems and industrial applications in diverse industries. The technology has the potential to save millions of dollars per year in fuel for fleet operators, and simultaneously reduce carbon emissions across the United States. Hybrid vehicles traditionally have a single energy regeneration source (braking) to charge batteries. Effectively incorporating a secondary regenerative charge system may open doors to many new regenerative technologies that work in unison to charge hybrid vehicle batteries, thus allowing for significant reductions in waste energy. The market potential for the technology is considerable, and includes trucks, military vehicles, transit buses, passenger vehicles, and rail. When incorporated into conventional non-hybrid platforms, the technology can improve fuel economy by displacing alternator load. In addition to vehicular applications, the research may, on a broader scale, lead to enabling technologies for compact, sealed, and efficient hydraulic actuators and energy harvesters. This will have applications in other fields such as aviation, industrial machinery, and robotics.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is expected to be realized in two principal areas. There have been extensive efforts to mask hydraulic noise, but the proposed effort is directed at eliminating the hydraulic ripple before it is created at the source. Traditional passive methods of masking noise are insufficient because they work effectively only in a limited operating range. This is inadequate because hydraulic systems typically must operate over a wide range of speed and loads. First this project is expected to make hydraulic active suspension systems quieter, more responsive and robust and, therefore, more readily and widely adopted by industry. The resulting likely increased use of active suspension systems will, therefore, have the added societal benefit of improved vehicle safety and comfort. This project is also expected to have a much wider impact on the hydraulic noise that has been a chronic pain point for the hydraulics industry for decades. It will allow for the manufacture of quieter and more durable hydraulic pumps for many applications beyond active suspension.


    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is an investigation of the feasibility of using an active buffer to eliminate flow ripple from a hydraulic pump, such as a gerotor pump. In a representative hydraulic system, the gerotor pump is at the heart of an advanced electro-hydraulic, active suspension actuator. Due to their geometry, positive displacement pumps provide small fluctuations in their fluid flow rate at a constant pump RPM. These small changes in flow rate create pressure fluctuations that can create significant mechanical movement that results in objectionable or unhealthy noise. The proposed effort is directed specifically at mitigating acoustic and structural vibration noise caused by such a pump. The proposed effort will utilize a combination of advanced experimental and computer simulation techniques to demonstrate the viability of the approach in the representative hydraulic system (an active suspension actuator). Hydraulic system noise is a widespread pain point in numerous applications involving hydraulic pumps. A key difficulty with hydraulic pumps is that they are often required to perform over a wide range of speeds and pressures. Conventional noise control devices typically can only be optimized for a relatively narrow portion of this range.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will address the challenge of fouling on membranes used in biopharmaceutical processing. The successful application of this coating would enable increase in the membrane lifetime and product yield of various production streams as less of the valuable compounds remain trapped in the membrane. This can increase production capacity for life-saving medicines, reduce production costs and, in certain cases, enable continuous biopharmaceutical manufacturing. Furthermore, functionalization of membranes currently involve significant quantities of environmentally harmful solvents, which may be leachable during usage of the membrane. This issue is avoided in the current project by utilizing initiated chemical vapor deposition (iCVD) process which does not require any solvent. This coating technology can also be extended to other systems including wastewater purification, food & beverage production, industrial separations, and medical devices that rely on a similar functionalization.

    The objective of Phase II will be to demonstrate a commercially viable manufacturing process to produce surface modifications within porous membranes using the iCVD process. Previous work in this subject has focused on top-coats on the top surfaces of reverse osmosis membranes, but the chemistries utilized have never before been demonstrated within interior structures of the membrane filters. During the Phase II work, the performance of the coatings will be optimized by using existing deposition equipment to tune the coating chemistry and process conditions to maximize the flux and throughput by minimizing protein fouling. The other main technical goal of the work will be to translate the current batch process into a continuous roll-to-roll process that is amenable to large-scale manufacturing. The outcome of this study will be a proven coating chemistry that is effective and durable in the membrane application, and an optimized manufacturing process capable of being implemented within current standards of membrane manufacturing.

  title: 'SBIR Phase II:  Anti-fouling surface modifications for purification membranes'
- abstractText: "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will
    test the efficacy of high-volume scaled microorganisms with the ability to induce
    cementation for masonry applications using methods proven at laboratory scale.
    Sporosarcina Pasteurii, a common non-pathogenic soil bacterium, has the ability
    to induce the creation of a biocement material, fusing loose grains of aggregate.
    Mineral growth fills gaps between the aggregate grains, biocementing the particles
    together in a structural bond, a process that takes a few days or less. The resulting
    material has a composition and demonstrates physical properties similar to natural
    sandstone. Traditional masonry manufacturing is reliant upon expensive fuel sources
    for hardening the final product, and these represent a large percentage of total
    manufacturing costs.  Biocementation at ambient conditions as a method for binding
    material into masonry units allows a cost advantage by eliminating the need for
    firing the final product.  The objectives of this effort include an extension
    of the baseline fermentation process for microorganism scale-up, testing of the
    efficacy of cell recovery, and efficiacy testing of the full-scale masonry product.
    \ This research will also focus on testing the process efficacy with inexpensive
    industrial media in conjunction with high-volume fermentation and recovery practices.
    \n\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the demonstration
    of the commercial viability of an optimized production process for masonry units
    (bricks) based on biocementation.   Over 80% of global construction uses masonry.
    Masonry manufacturing is a $24 billion business in the US. According to the Carbon
    War Room, 1.23 trillion fired bricks are manufactured globally each year, emitting
    over 800 million tons of carbon emissions.  Due to increased regulations introduced
    by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), several masonry companies have had
    to either shut down or invest significant sums in cleaner production methods due
    to these associated emissions. Government incentives for green construction, compounded
    with increasing sustainability concerns - for example, end users such as architects,
    are specifying the use of more sustainable materials - have created an opportunity
    for the adoption of \"greener\" cementitious materials. The societal impacts of
    this research will include a significant reduction of carbon emissions and the
    addition of manufacturing jobs in the US. Biocementation has also been investigated
    for use in soil stabilization and mine recovery. This project will enhance the
    technological understanding of this process, will help to establish commercial
    viability, and will generate additional practical data including durability and
    physical performance."

    This Small Innovation Research Phase I project aims to demonstrate the feasibility of the Raman Force Microscope (RFM) to provide a new metrology tool for in situ topographic, strain, and chemical analysis with nanometer spatial resolution.  Feature size reduction in the semiconductor industry requires that metrology methods must routinely measure properties down to the atomic scale.  Novel materials and geometries add to the complexity of measurements. RFM technology is a combination of Raman microscopy and atomic force microscopy (AFM), where an AFM tip provides a nanometer scale light source to generate stimulated Raman scattering, and at the same time measures the force gradient arising from the Raman scattering. The use of the AFM tip as the Raman scattering detector significantly simplifies Raman signal acquisition and system configuration.  By combining a high-speed AFM scheme, this technology allows for in-line characterization of physical and chemical properties of nanoscale materials and structures in the manufacturing environment, i.e. stress in the channel layer and chemical characterization defects. The objectives of the proposed Phase I study are (1) to demonstrate reflection mode RFM for Raman signal measurement of Si wafers and (2) to demonstrate measurement of stress-induced Raman shifts in nanometer-sized features.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be felt not only in the semiconductor industry but across many disciplines and industries, both in academia and industry.  RFM can be used to measure and characterize a wide variety of nanoscale materials and structures, e.g. high- and low-k dielectric films and other emerging materials (such as graphene) used in advanced semiconductor processes. It can be also widely used across disciplines, e.g. for the measurement of nanoparticle homogeneity or optimization of self-assembled monolayers in surface chemistry. The RFM technique also has the capability to image individual biomolecules in situ, such as for the real-time monitoring of membrane protein dynamics on cells, which will provide unprecedented utility in biomedical and clinical research.  A reliable label-free imaging tool with the capability to identify chemical bond information at the molecular level will potentially bring about revolutionary advances in many fields of basic and applied biological science, including drug discovery, proteomics, structural biology, and personalized medicine.  The RFM technique will be simpler to implement as compared to other hybrid instruments involving high resolution microscopy, resulting in an affordable instrument for academic and research institutions.

- abstractText: |-
    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop a production prototype of an automated nanoscale manufacturing process monitoring tool based on the resonance force microscope (RFM).  The tool will combine image force microscopy (IFM, a version of RFM that measures the linear part of the susceptibility) and scattering near-field optical microscopy (sSNOM) with atomic force microscope for use in the hard disk drive (HDD) and semiconductor industries.  sSNOM measures the dipole-dipole interaction force while IFM measures the dipole-dipole force gradient, both with nanometer spatial resolution.  These techniques allow direct imaging of resonances associated with electrons, phonons, and plasmons.  The capability to image plasmon resonances is well suited to probe the near-field (NF) profile associated with a plasmonic structure called near-field transducer (NFT) utilized in heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR).  With HAMR universally viewed as the next generation technology for HDD industry, the need for a monitoring tool for mass production of HAMR head is acute since there is currently no simple way to probe the NF profile of NFTs.  The objectives of the proposed project are (1) to successfully prototype an automated NFT characterization tool and (2) to field test it with one or more HDD manufacturers.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be felt not only in the HDD industry but across many industries.  While the monitoring of NFT production is the near-term niche application for the automated tool, the same tool will have longer-term value for in-line characterization of physical and chemical properties of nanoscale materials and structures in the manufacturing environment of diverse industries, including, for example, the measurement of stress in the channel layer and chemical characterization of defects in semiconductor industry and monitoring of protein-based pharmaceuticals.  In R&D and academic settings, the RFM technique provides the capability to image individual biomolecules in situ, such as for the real-time monitoring of membrane protein dynamics on cells, which will provide unprecedented utility in biomedical and clinical research.  A reliable label-free imaging tool with the capability to identify chemical bond information at the molecular level will potentially bring about revolutionary advances in many fields of basic and applied biological science, including drug discovery, proteomics, structural biology, and personalized medicine.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is for the development of end user-moldable advanced polyimine composite inputs for the athletic protective gear market (which is valued at $16.6 billion). Currently, plastic products must be produced using industrial manufacturing techniques that have high tooling costs. As a result, manufacturers produce a small range of predetermined sizes and shapes, which do not provide a custom fit for end users. In the case of athletic gear, there is a growing market for hard-shell protective equipment which can be custom molded for a better fit. Polyimine polymers and advanced composites offer a compelling blend of strength and malleability in order to create more user-friendly lightweight and durable advanced composites that may be shaped by the end-user. In addition to creating greater user customization, both the virgin polyimine polymer and advanced composites that incorporate polyimines are easily and economically recyclable. The total U.S. composite materials market is a $30 billion market, representing 36% of the global composites sector. Polyimine polymers and advanced composite derivatives will reduce environmental waste and increase manufacturing efficiencies across a broad range of vertical markets in the composites sector including personal protective equipment, aerospace, automotive, and infrastructural materials.

    The intellectual merit of this project derives from the development of the unique chemistry of polyimine polymers. Polymers can be broadly grouped into two categories, thermosets and thermoplastics. Thermosets are strong due to the chemical characteristics of the plastic. However, once cured, thermosets cannot be reshaped. As a result, thermosets are neither repairable, nor are they efficiently recyclable. In contrast, thermoplastics, which are weaker than thermosets, may be molded and remolded. However, remolding requires very high industrial temperatures of between 400 and 600 deg. F. Polyimine polymers are moldable and remoldable thermoset materials. Importantly, these polymers combine high rigidity and tough mechanical properties with mild molding temperatures. This Phase I research project will include developing end user moldable composite materials that are a maximum of ¼ inch in thickness and meet industry standards for limb joint protective equipment. Material testing and mechanical characterization will relate to testing requirements arising from composite prototype development including but not limited to: delamination, fiber-dependent moldability, fiber-dependent flex, fiber-dependent tensile, fiber/resin-dependent pass-through impact force, and failure analysis.

    mortar preparation and application. This means a system that can account for the

    of developing a measurement and control system that can accurately determine the
    quality of the mortar and adjust as necessary to produce consistent mortar that
    meets the requirements of the SAM system.  Masonry jobs are dynamic work environments
    that need to be adjusted and corrected in real time, presenting numerous challenges
    for automation, but if successful, the potential benefits are enormous. \n\nThe

    significantly increase the throughput of brick masonry production.  Our core technology
    incorporates proprietary sensing and control systems, with the dispensing of mortar
    to achieve information-driven automated bricklaying.  Brick-based construction
    represents a significant portion of the global and US economies with over $20
    billion spent on all masonry work in the US, and over $5 billion spent on commercial
    brick masonry.  This segment of the construction industry has seen little innovation
    over the recent decades. The SAM system will provide a per-job cost savings of
    over 30% based on increased productivity of the masonry crew.  This significant
    increase in the efficiency of masons will make brick masonry more affordable.
    By using more technology in the masonry industry, it will be easier to recruit
    younger talent to an industry with an aging work force.  The increase in the use
    of bricks in construction, especially in regions that are susceptible to extreme
    weather conditions, will provide many environmental and customer benefits such

    younger masons to the industry.  Brick-based construction represents a significant
    portion of the global and U.S. economies, with over $20 billion spent on all domestic
    masonry work, and over $5 billion spent on commercial brick masonry alone.  The
    significant increase in efficiency provided by this SAM system will make brick
    masonry more affordable.  This could potentially lead to growth of the brick industry,
    resulting in many environmental and customer benefits such as energy and resource
    conservation.  Through commercialization of the world's first robotic Semi-Automated
    masonry system, this project will help to expand the capability of an industry
    and revitalize the masonry trade."

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will support the development of a novel approach, based on holographic video microscopy, to analyze the physical properties of colloidal dispersions. This technology will have immediate applications in industries as diverse as pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, personal care products, petrochemicals and food, all of which rely on the properties of colloidal dispersions and the microscopic particles from which they are composed. The worldwide market for particle characterization exceeded $5 billion per year in 2012. The present effort's holographic characterization technology extends the state-of-the-art in particle characterization by providing simultaneous information about both the size and the composition of individual particles in dispersion, and by building up a clear picture of the distribution of properties within a sample without relying on models or assumptions. Access to these new dimensions of information will be useful for product development, process control and quality assurance in all of the industrial sectors that rely on the properties of colloidal materials, thereby increasing opportunities for innovation, enhancing product performance, and decreasing manufacturing costs. In addition to capturing a share of the established market for particle characterization, this new product may also broaden the market by creating new application areas.

    The intellectual merit of this project resides in transforming holographic video microscopy from an academic research tool to a powerful commercial instrument.  Several innovations are required to make this revolutionary technology commercially viable. In its present incarnation, holographic characterization has been demonstrated with nearly ideal spheres, for which it yields the size to within a nanometer, the complex refractive index to within a part per thousand, and the time-resolved trajectory to within a nanometer in three dimensions. No other particle characterization technique offers such a wealth of particle-resolved information. This Phase I effort will demonstrate the feasibility of holographic particle characterization for a range of non-ideal industrial materials by applying state-of-the-art methods of machine learning to extend the technique's domain of applicability while simultaneously reducing the time per analysis from seconds to tens of milliseconds. This 100-fold acceleration, and the associated reduction in computational cost, will enable the technology to be deployed in large-volume and high-throughput applications. The resulting real-time insights into colloidal dispersions' compositions will improve manufacturing efficiency by identifying and helping to correct process deviations and failures.  In so doing it will reduce product costs in all of the industrial sectors that develop and sell colloidal materials.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will enable a commercial implementation of holographic video microscopy, a fast, precise and flexible technology for measuring the properties of individual colloidal particles suspended in fluid media. This disruptive technology solves critical manufacturing problems across industries that work with colloidal dispersions.  Demonstrated applications include: 1) monitoring the growth of nanoparticle agglomerates in precision slurries used to polish semiconductor wafers where scratches due to slurry agglomerates are responsible for waste valued at $1 billion annually; 2) tracking concentrations of dangerous contaminants in wastewater streams; and 3) measuring the concentration of protein aggregates in biopharmaceuticals, a safety concern noted by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in this $250 billion industry.  Holographic video microscopy is unique among particle-characterization technologies in providing comprehensive information about the size, shape and composition of individual particles in real time and in situ. Having access to this wealth of data facilitates product development, creates new opportunities for process control and provides a new tool for quality assurance across a broad spectrum of industries enabling safer, less expensive products for consumers while providing cost savings to manufacturers.

    The technical objectives of this project are: 1) to optimize the design of the underlying holographic microscopy system without compromising the quality of results; 2) to enable quantitative concentration determination including corrections for perturbations introduced by flow dynamics; 3) to expand the domain of operation to characterize non-spherical particles and 4) to apply machine-learning algorithms for automated robust operation.  Using holographic video microscopy for commercial applications requires adaptation and innovation in the design of the prototype instrument that was used to demonstrate feasibility. Streamlining the optical train will require advanced modeling and the creation of new methods of correcting optical aberrations to enable ease of manufacture. Additional improvements in design will include advances in improving microfluidic flow control to generate accurate concentration determination, to adapt holographic analysis algorithms for characterizing the structure of aspheric particles, and to extend analytical capabilities for turbid fluids. Finally, innovative machine-learning using neural network algorithms demonstrated significant improvements for analytical robustness in Phase I and will be extended to a wider range of applications. The Phase II effort will enable holographic video microscopy of real-world samples with typical measurement times of a few minutes.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a novel low-cost, high-performance fabric suitable for long service life helium inflatable structures, including aerostats and airships. Traditional fabrics for lighter-than-air (LTA) applications utilize woven polyester or vectran basecloths laminated with various materials that improve gas retention, environmental resistance and allow the material to be thermally bonded. This combination has excellent performance, providing a useful service life in excess of seven years, but comes at a high cost, which limits the commercial application of helium inflatable structures. The proposed low-cost, high performance fabric replaces the woven basecloth with a scrim of high-strength synthetic fibers, similar to those in high-end sailcloth. This type of material has not seen wide use in helium inflatable structures where seams are subject to long-term loading from internal pressure. The impact of scrim pattern and yarn alignment on seam stiffness and long-term holding strength is considered. This Phase I research will investigate the behavior of these materials, as well as one or more alternative woven fabrics, under long-term loading, UV exposure, and mechanical wear and tear, in order to evaluate their suitability for helium inflatables.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be a step toward the widespread commercialization of LTA inflatable structures in traditional and new application areas. Helium inflatable structures are traditionally used for transporting or elevating high value payloads, such as military surveillance equipment or advertising, where the relatively high cost of the fabric envelope is not a barrier to commercial feasibility. The advent of a low-cost, high performance helium inflatable fabric will make LTA structures economically viable for a number of industries that are cost-sensitive, including remote and emergency wireless communication; low-cost freight transport; and airborne wind energy production. The research will also enhance the understanding of the behavior of scrim-based fabrics under loading conditions, which may benefit a wide range of industries that could use these fabrics, including sailing, architectural fabrics and air inflatable structures.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop an ultra-light, modular wind turbine for use in buoyant airborne wind energy systems. Reduced turbine weight has a cascading effect on total airborne system mass, allowing a significantly smaller, lower cost buoyant structure to be used to access high altitude winds. At heights up to 2,000 feet winds are strong and consistent, allowing for the production of low-cost, reliable power at a broad array of sites. High altitude winds have over five times the energy potential of ground winds accessed by tower-mounted turbines, opening the potential for a major new renewable energy resource to be harnessed. In addition, the containerized deployment of airborne wind turbines has the potential to expand wind development to sites that are not feasible today, including sites that are remote or have weak ground-level winds. Overall, the technology holds the potential to significantly lower energy costs and improve reliability for remote industrial, community, and military customers and represents a major step forward in unlocking the abundant high-altitude wind resource to help in the global pursuit of greater adoption of renewable energy sources.

    This SBIR Phase II project will focus on reducing the total weight of the wind turbine system.  Turbine weight is one of the most critical cost drivers of buoyant airborne wind energy systems. For each kilogram removed from the turbine, an additional kilogram can be removed from the inflatable shell and tethers, resulting in a significantly smaller and lower cost system. The lightest commercially available small- to medium-sized wind turbine weighs 31.1 kilograms per kilowatt of capacity, which is too heavy for an economically-viable airborne turbine. By incorporating a compact, modular architecture, a lightweight permanent magnet direct-drive (PMDD) generator and high-strength composite materials, the proposed Phase II research effort aims to double the power density of traditional medium size turbines, making the proposed system suitable for use in an airborne application, while maintaining a high level of reliability and cost performance.

    performance advantages as compared to uncoated steel rebar.  These advantages
    include a sevenfold weight reduction, the elimination of corrosion, a 30% reduction

    carbon fiber in a variety of applications.  Additionally, thermoset resins not
    commonly used in pultrusion can offer improved performance characteristics that
    cannot be achieved with typical FRP rebar resins.  Completion of this project

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to engineer microbes for the cost-effective production of the amino acid, L-Threonine. Currently, engineered microbes bear mutations that increase the production of Threonine of interest by inhibiting the cell?s ability to produce other amino acids. These mutations are critical as they effectively channel the cell?s metabolic flux toward Threonine, thereby boosting production efficiency and easing downstream purification. Unfortunately, these mutations also decrease cellular fitness and, thus, the growth media must be supplemented with costly nutrients. Technical research herein will assess the feasibility of applying novel regulated proteolysis technology to direct metabolic flux toward Threonine production in the absence of costly media supplementation. The project has 3 key objectives: 1) generate E. coli strains containing off-pathway metabolic enzymes tagged for degradation by a growth-phase dependent proteolysis system, 2) test the ability of these strains to grow on supplement-free media, and 3) assay for production of Threonine by these engineered strains. We anticipate that our engineered strains will grow robustly on minimal, un-supplemented media. Upon induction of our proteolysis system, we expect our strains to specifically eliminate off-target metabolic pathways, leading to a substantial increase in production of our target product, Threonine.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the generation of more cost-efficient L-Threonine producing microbial strains. Purified amino acids are estimated to constitute a U.S. market of $1.30 billion by 2013. These chemicals are used as animal feedstock supplements, precursors in production of the artificial sweetener aspartame, and have potential as biofuel precursors. Currently, key amino acids are produced commercially using highly engineered microbes that convert low-cost sugar sources (e.g. glucose) to the final amino acid product. To improve the conversion efficiency and ease downstream purification, the microbe?s ability to synthesize other, off-pathway amino acids is often eliminated.  However, because these other amino acids are critical for bacterial growth, they must be added as a supplement to the growth medium, substantially increasing production costs.  The technology proposed here would allow for efficient, robust production of easily purified amino acids without the need for media supplementation, dramatically reducing production costs. Moreover, the regulated degradation technology developed herein will provide next-generation regulatory tools for other industrial metabolic engineering applications.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to produce microbes capable of cost-effective production of amino acids used as animal feed supplements.  Technical research herein will test the feasibility of applying cutting edge synthetic biology and metabolic engineering techniques to develop engineered strains capable of sustainable and cost-effective production of purified animal feed supplements.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to provide a reliable, sustainable and safe source of animal feed supplements using biotechnology. Many plant-based animals feeds, such as those based on maize, are deficient in key nutrients needed for growth. To improve feed efficiency and animal growth rates, these deficiencies have been historically overcome with supplementation with animal waste or protein-rich plant products including soy. Recent BSE (Mad Cow Disease) outbreaks combined with dioxine toxicity (from supplementation with fish products) however, have discouraged the use of animal products. Further, supplementation with soy supplies excess, unnecessary amino acids that the animals excrete as nitrogen-rich waste, a significant environmental pollutant. Feed supplementation using purified amino acids produced via biotechnology offers a superior approach from a safety and environmental sustainability perspective.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to produce low-cost and customizable aromas that are inspired by plant extracts.  The fragrance industry uses fragrant extracts from flowers and other plant materials as basic building blocks for haute-couture finished fragrances. These extracts are expensive due to the limited availability of suitable plant materials, and due to the fact that the extracts are too complicated to replicate by mixing pure chemicals. This project will generate novel fragrance blends via fermentation ("cultured aromas"). These cultured aromas will be customized for the exacting requirements of professional perfumers, offering a degree of creativity that does not exist with plant extracts. This technology will present a disruptive entry into the multi-billion dollar market for finished fragrances. Beyond fragrances, this technology will allow the development of new customizable extracts with the beneficial properties of plant extracts, including flavors, dyes, and antioxidant activity.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to apply advanced synthetic biology tools to produce sustainable alternatives to complex plant extracts. Conventional metabolic engineering projects focus on the optimized production of a single target compound; this project instead will engineer microbial strains that produce a range of components found in high-value plant extracts used in the fragrance industry. The goal is to rapidly screen and characterize novel plant enzymes for use in conjunction with existing strains that produce key fragrance molecules. These novel enzymes are expected to produce multiple fragrance molecules and the profile of the resulting blends will be compared to those derived from plants via high throughput metabolomics. The cultured aroma blends can then be customized to a perfumers' specification by tuning the biosynthetic pathways.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes to develop a set of novel, versatile measurement tools for use during fermentation and scale-up in metabolic engineering. The tools will be based on the production of odorants and enable real-time time monitoring of gene expression levels during fermentation. Metabolic engineering holds great promise for enabling a range of important applications including cellulosic biofuels, therapeutics production, and bio-based, environmentally-friendly chemical manufacturing. But any such project requires that an engineered organism expressing the relevant biosynthetic pathway be scaled up from lab-sized cultures to large-scale commercial fermentation. This is not a straightforward task, and is different for every project, because the fermentation conditions required for each engineered strain are different. The new measurement tools will enable more detailed quantification of cell state during fermentation so that strain and pathway optimization is more informed.

    The broader impacts of this research are to enable more informed strain optimization for large-scale fermentation thereby reducing R&D costs for the bio-based manufacturing industry. With the growing interest in clean technology and alternatives to petroleum-based manufacturing, many new companies and existing companies are moving into the bioengineering and biomanufacturing industries. However, all of these companies face a common hurdle of scaling up production of their fuel, specialty chemical or biomaterial to commercial scale. The companies spend significant R&D money and time optimizing pathway yield during fermentation. For example, Dupont took 7 years and $400M to scale-up microbial production of 1,3-propanediol.  Jay Keasling, a founder of Amyris Biotechnologies, a leading synthetic biology company, reported that Amyris spends 95% of their time trying to find and eliminate unintended interactions between components in their engineered metabolic pathways. Reducing the R&D costs in the biofuels and industrial biotechnology industries would open up new application areas to environmentally-friendly, bio-based production solutions.

  title: 'SBIR Phase IB:  Volatile gene expression reporters for use during fermentation'
- abstractText: |-
    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project aims to engineer microbes for the cost-effective production of specialty chemicals. Currently, engineered microbial strains bear mutations that increase the production of chemicals of interest by inhibiting the cell's ability to produce off pathway chemicals. These "loss-of-function" mutations are critical as they effectively channel the cell's metabolic flux toward the product of interest. This both boosts the production efficiency and eases downstream purification by eliminating the accumulation of undesirable but chemically-similar contaminants. Unfortunately, these mutations may also decrease the fitness of the cells and, as a result, the growth media must be supplemented with costly nutrients. Technical research herein will assess the feasibility of applying novel regulated proteolysis technology to simultaneously direct maximal metabolic flux toward the target chemical of interest while avoiding the need to supplement the growth media. If successful, this technology would provide a great cost savings and enable fermentative production to be applied more broadly in the production of specialty chemicals.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to provide a stable and cost-effective fermentative production route to a specialty chemical.  Fermentative production of chemicals offers many advantages over traditional petrochemical or extraction-based production processes.  Petrochemical production maintains the nation?s reliance on an unsustainable feedstock (oil) and also leads to national security issues as the US is largely dependent on foreign oil sources.  Chemical production via extraction from plant materials also has ecological challenges.  The process often uses toxic solvents, and may rely on unsustainable farming practices for many plants that are not traditional food crops.  Engineered microbes fermented on sugar feedstock produced using high-efficiency agricultural practices offer a stable alternative for producing specialty chemicals, both in terms of supply and price.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to develop an alternative to the use of
    antibiotics in agricultural and companion animals.  It has recently been demonstrated
    that the practice of feeding antibiotics to livestock is correlated with the emergence
    of antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria that infect humans.  For this reason,
    the FDA has recently introduced a voluntary plan to phase out the use of antibiotics
    in animals.  However, antibiotic use to protect animal health and to promote weight
    gain is widespread in the livestock industry, and a viable and non-harmful alternative
    is needed. The proposed technology will allow livestock growers to protect their
    animals and promote weight gain by feeding edible green algae that have been engineered
    to produce colostrum proteins.  Colostrum proteins are thought to have the same
    protective effects as antibiotics without the negative side effect of producing
    antibiotic resistant bacteria.  Production of these colostrum proteins in green
    algae allows for efficient bio-manufacturing, which will meet the scale required
    to supply livestock producers with a cost effective source of colostrum.  Sales
    of antibiotics for animal health and weight gain are in the billions of dollars
    each year, and this new approach has the potential to garner a significant share
    of that market as the industry shifts away from the use of antibiotics. \n\n\nThis
    SBIR project proposes to develop genetically engineered strains of green algae,
    Chlamydomomas reinhardtii, that produce colostrum proteins.  Colostrum proteins
    are normally ingested into the digestive tract where they exhibit anti-microbial
    properties. C. reinhardtii has been shown to have the necessary cellular machinery
    to produce a wide range of complex proteins including monoclonal antibodies, hormones,
    and others.  The goal is to produce several key colostrum proteins in C. reinhardtii
    that will be fed to livestock as a replacement for antibiotics, and be included
    in companion animal diets.  The proposed research will demonstrate that colostrum
    proteins produced in algae are bioactive, and will function in the same manner
    as their natural counterparts.  Additionally, the research will produce a media
    in which to grow edible algae that is safe for animal consumption and promotes
    the expression of the colostrum protein of interest.  Finally, the research will
    demonstrate that algal expressed colostrum proteins have a beneficial effect on
    animal health and growth promotion. Together, this research will help demonstrate
    the feasibility of using algal-expressed colostrum proteins as a replacement for
    antibiotic use in livestock feeds and promotion of pet health in pet food."

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to produce colostrum proteins in edible
    green algae that have the potential to reduce the use and dependence on antibiotics
    in livestock animals. Colostrum proteins have both beneficial health and growth
    properties that may drastically decrease the dependence on antibiotics. Unfortunately,
    there is a limited supply of colostrum. Algae provide an affordable and scalable
    system for the production of the valuable proteins found in colostrum. Recently,
    it was demonstrated that the use of antibiotics in livestock animals caused the
    formation of antibiotic resistant bacteria. Colostrum proteins naturally stimulate
    the animal's immune system and allows them to improve their own ability to fight

    to gain market share from the multi-billion dollar antibiotic industry. \n\nThis
    SBIR Phase II project proposes to demonstrate the feasibility of producing colostrum
    proteins in algae using biomanufacturing. Some of the problems associated with
    having the animal livestock industry adapt a new product is demonstrating cost
    and feasibility. To accomplish the goal of decreasing antibiotic use, this project
    will first focus on optimizing the production process to drive the cost of producing
    colostrum proteins in algae down. Next, work will be done on developing optimal
    formulations of colostrum proteins and testing them in mice models before moving
    to larger livestock animals. Once an optimal formulation is established, trials
    will be done in pig models. In the pig models, colostrum proteins produced in
    algae will be tested to determine their ability to assist animals in fighting
    off infections and also their ability to improve the animal's rate of weight gain.
    Finally, this project will strive to demonstrate that colostrum proteins produced
    in algae can give the same positive outcomes in animals when compared to animals
    given antibiotics. By accomplishing these goals, algae colostrum proteins can
    drastically decrease the dependence on antibiotics and their negative side effects."

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) project is to address a major barrier in fundamental biological
    research and next-generation clinical treatments:  Delivering materials into cells.
    Cells are the basic functional unit of the body yet understanding their role in
    disease and harnessing their inherent potential to combat ailments has been limited
    by our inability to deliver material to their cytoplasm. By facilitating access
    to a cell's interior one could enable rapid progress in the ability to probe intracellular
    processes and engineer cell function for therapeutic purposes. This project aims
    to further develop a promising new concept of intracellular delivery capable of
    overcoming many conventional barriers associated with the current state-of-the-art.
    The platform will potentially facilitate the development of novel therapeutics
    based on a deeper understanding of cell function and a more robust ability to
    engineer cell fate. Indeed, addressing such a fundamental challenge in the biomedical
    field would provide substantial benefits to society and could impact numerous
    commercial opportunities. Potential applications include basic research, high-throughput
    drug discovery screening, and cell-based therapies to treat cancer immunotherapies.
    \n\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a vector-free microfluidic platform
    for intracellular delivery of biomolecules in order to increase efficacy, and
    improve ease-of-use. The platform uses a novel method based on rapid, transient
    deformation of cells (\"cell squeezing\") as they pass through a microfluidic
    constriction. The squeezing process causes temporary disruption of the cell membrane
    and facilitates passive transport of target delivery materials into the cytoplasm.
    The proposed work aims to introduce automated, closed-loop control of key parameters
    (pressure, temperature, and flow rate) that govern the delivery process. These
    additions will allow users to precisely tune the amount of material delivered
    to cells and the resultant viability. By developing this hardware, the technology
    will be well-positioned for increased adoption and commercialization by the end
    of Phase I. The proposed hardware controllers will be verified and validated through
    relevant studies using primary immune cells, a disease-relevant subset of cells
    that are recalcitrant to existing delivery methods. Finally, the proposed work
    would facilitate the launch of a robust prototype system for early-stage testing
    in high-impact applications."

    Into Cells'
- abstractText: |-
    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the development of technology for the intracellular delivery of biomolecules directly into cells. This microfluidics-based platform has the potential to become an enabling technology for intracellular delivery, which may be used to accelerate drug discovery R&D by allowing reliable, efficient delivery of diverse material classes without having to engineer the material or the cell to natively uptake these molecules. Such capabilities could allow pharmaceutical companies to assess the efficacy of drug candidates faster than ever before, especially with integration into high-throughput robotic workflows that are already well-established and efficacious. The technology could dramatically reduce the time to market for new drugs by decoupling determination of a candidate's activity from the cell's affinity for the molecule. It also could facilitate a deeper understanding of biological processes and pathways. Initial studies with leading drug developers and academic laboratories towards this goal have been very encouraging, and, in the future, the platform could potentially enable robust engineering of cell function for cell-based therapies targeting a diversity of diseases including influenza, cancer, and even autoimmune disorders.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes the continued development of the intracellular delivery technology to address relevant applications in drug discovery R&D. New drug discovery is often hampered by the inability of membrane-impermeable drug candidates to enter the cell cytosol, necessitating exogenous materials for delivery such as strong electric fields or viral vectors. However, these materials tend to cause off-target effects or toxicity, presenting a need for a technology that can facilitate delivery without altering post-treatment cellular function. The goal of this project is to demonstrate a platform geared towards market adoption of microfluidic hardware as the standard method for transfection and intracellular delivery. During Phase II, the platform will be fully-characterized, validated, and verified in order to produce the consistent, repeatable results necessary to achieve market entry. In addition, research is planned to demonstrate the ability of the platform to support drug discovery R&D by developing the use of the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system for use with this intracellular delivery technology.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of a drug screening system that will accelerate drug discovery for several eye diseases, including glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and macular edema.  This technology will fulfill unmet needs of small and large biopharmaceutical companies engaged in drug discovery for various eye diseases by reducing development cost, expediting preclinical research, and increasing the chances of clinical success.  From the socio-economic standpoint, this technology will result in the development of more effective ocular drugs that will decrease eye disease treatment cost. Furthermore, this model will facilitate more rapid development of technologies for the diagnosis of glaucoma and new surgical techniques in the management of this disease.  Overall, this screening system will accelerate the development of medications for eye diseases, enhancing the quality of life for millions of people.

    This SBIR Phase II project will address the lack of effective models for testing targeted glaucoma therapeutics and additional ocular diseases.  Currently, none of the available glaucoma medications target the eye tissue responsible for this disease due to absence of clinically relevant testing platform that incorporates this particular eye tissue. Presently, animal or human cadaver eyes are used to study and test the effects of medications on such tissue, however, these preparations are cumbersome and expensive. The proposed work will be the first-of-its-kind to engineer physiologically-relevant 3D human eye tissues utilizing novel cell culture methods along with microfabrication techniques and a microfluidic system. These 3D tissues will facilitate the development of disease-relevant in vitro model systems for understanding not only glaucoma but also diabetic retinopathy and macular edema pathology. This tool will help increase the success rate of glaucoma and ocular vasculature-related medications at later stages of drug development pipeline.

    Dry Eye Disease'
- abstractText: |-
    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop a bio-inspired contact lens that closely mimics the structure of natural tear film, and prevents contact lens-induced dry eye disease (CLIDE).  CLIDE is a serious problem faced by 50% of contact lens wearers. In spite of advances in materials and lens design, an estimated 10% of patients discontinue use each year due to CLIDE symptoms of dryness and discomfort. The architecture of the proposed lens minimizes tear film disruption through the use of a high water content polyethylene glycol (PEG) hydrogel that interfaces with the ocular environment. The unique multi-layered design will enable a new paradigm in contact lens design, which so far has relied on modifying copolymer blends rather than making use of discrete layers of bulk materials.  The objectives of this research project are to develop and optimize scalable manufacturing processes to produce the lenses and validate their safety in animals. The results of this project will enable efficacy studies in human subjects.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project, if successful, will be a contact lens that alleviates dryness and discomfort.   The global contact lens market is $6.8 billion dollars annually, with an estimated $680 million dollars in revenue lost from patients discontinuing lens wear due to discomfort. In addition to the significant commercial potential, and ability to improve patient comfort, development of this contact lens will have broader impacts in the ophthalmology and medical device fields. Through better understanding of the tear film-lens interactions, more reliable, objective, and quantifiable metrics to predict success and segment patients will be possible. The new lens architecture also may enable a better understanding of the various metrics used in comparing the comfort of contact lenses.  In addition, this device will validate the use of this unique material/design for other potential medical device applications.  The novel processes and technology under development in this project for thin film hydrogel deposition has broad application both in clinical science and fundamental research.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is the development of a first-in-class Predictive Phenotypic Profiler (PPP) software tool that will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the pre-clinical drug discovery process. A recent study of drugs approved by the FDA between 1998 and 2008 shows that a majority of first-in-class drugs are now derived from phenotypic screens rather than traditional target-based screens. However, there is currently a severe lack of computational and data tools that can bridge the vast amounts of traditional molecular-based data with the equally vast amounts of phenotypic data now being generated. The PPP tool integrates and interprets this complex and multi-faceted data to greatly enhance the ability of pharmaceutical companies to find new and effective drugs. The estimated cost per new prescription drug approval is $2.56 billion - the economic impact of reducing the pre-clinical drug discovery process by just one week is estimated to result in a $108 million cost savings for the pharmaceutical industry, creating a large financial opportunity. This tool aims to enhance the number and quality of drugs that enter clinical trials, resulting in more economically priced medicines available to the population.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a proof-of-concept PPP software tool that brings together a variety of publicly available molecular and phenotypic data sources into a graphical user interface, allowing for the discovery of novel mechanisms of action, and the identification of target(s) from phenotypic assays. The major hurdles of this project will be the integration of these highly heterogeneous datasets and the identification of evidence based path patterns. Semantic technologies and domain expertise will be applied to this application to surmount these data integration and prediction challenges. The plan to reach the goal of a prototype PPP tool includes:  1) Creating a semantic graph for phenotypic data sources, 2) finding evidence-based path patterns in phenotypic data, 3) applying predictive algorithms for phenotypic data analysis, and 4) developing a graphical user interface for evaluation and verification. Phase I success will result in a tool that can be used by pharmaceutical companies for evaluation and product feedback.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of an informatics-based software platform that will help pharmaceutical companies create more new, effective, and safe drugs earlier in the R&D pipeline. This software platform will address a need for data integration and analysis tools to aid pharmaceutical researchers in 1) phenotypic screening, 2) toxicology analysis, and 3) drug repurposing. It will help these researchers quickly gather and interpret complex molecular and phenotypic data, making the drug discovery process more efficient and creating value for pharmaceutical companies. The economic impact of reducing the preclinical drug discovery process by just two weeks is estimated to be a $252 million cost savings for the industry. By using data more effectively earlier in the R&D process, this software platform also promises to enhance the quality of drugs that enter clinical trials. Thus, it provides an opportunity to reduce overall R&D spending and increase the number of drugs that enter the market - resulting in more economically priced medicines available to the population.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to build an informatics-based software platform that solves cross-domain data integration, analysis, and user application challenges in order to effectively use data to draw insights earlier in the R&D process and compress the development pipeline for new or repurposed drugs. Using highly scalable semantic graph technologies, a flexible three-layer architecture is being developed that includes the 1) Biomedical Data Layer, 2) Computational Layer, and 3) Application Layer. This architecture allows the system be fully scalable and extensible to other datasets and biomedical applications. The system will be beta-tested by pharmaceutical researchers and evaluated though the creation of scientifically relevant use-cases. This development will result in a commercial software system that makes important biomedical data and insights available to all researchers within a pharmaceutical organization by addressing high need data integration, analysis, and application challenges.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project creates GeniStress Responder. GeniStress Responder is part of EkaTox, a family of toxicology diagnostics harnessing the power of comparative genomics in nematodes to make toxicology predictions in humans. GeniStress Responder identifies and characterizes mutagenic and carcinogenic compounds (genotoxins) using bioengineered nematodes. Multiple types of bioengineered nematodes are created and arranged into a GeniStress Responder panel. The panel's bioengineered nematodes become biosensors of genotoxic activity. Each biosensor works by using a specific genotoxin-sensitive gene to drive expression of a fluorescent-protein coding sequence. Exposure to a specific genotoxin elicits a specific pattern of activity in the GeniStress Responder panel. Feasibility is demonstrated when known genotoxins create specific toxicogenomic responses in the GeniStress Responder panel.

    The broader/commercial impacts of this research are introduction of improved genotoxicity diagnostics in the marketplace. Current technologies are inadequate. No single test is available to comprehensively profile different types of sample genotoxicity. The market needs an easy-to-use test for genotoxicity profiling. GeniStress Responder fills the market need for genotoxicity profiling in one simple diagnostic kit. With GeniStress Responder, a toxic compound's mechanism-of-action is determined in a shorter time and with fewer resources, than what can be achieved with current technology. GeniStress Responder's ease-of-use will accelerate drug discovery (cancer therapeutics) and environmental toxicology testing (cosmetics, plastics, super-fund site cleanup).

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project creates a drug-screening platform for discovery of new antiparasitic drugs. Resistance to current drug treatments is on the rise. New antiparasitic drugs under development are mostly focused on neurotransmission targets, yet a new target has recently emerged, the daf-12 gene. Knudra uses a core expertise in nematode bioengineering to insert parasite genes into the C. elegans roundworm. Drug candidates are found against the parasite gene by the use of biosensor backgrounds, which use fluorescent gene-expression reporters that turn red upon detection of antiparasitic activity. Phase I feasibility is demonstrated when known agonist and antagonist of DAF-12 elicit expected activity on the parasite gene. The platform may then be used to screen compound libraries to find candidates for anthelmintic use.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project, if successful, will be the creation of a screening platform for finding antiparasitics to help in the battle against important diseases such as elephantiasis, river blindness, trichinosis, Enterobiasis (pinworm), and parasitic infections in livestock and crops. Parasitic infection in livestock and humans currently are treated with more than 20 drugs on the market, but some are toxic and carry black box warnings.  Food and health security throughout the world would be enhanced with the development of new antiparasites that are safer and more effective.  In addition, the technology will help to bring clarity of understanding to the biology of infective-state formation in parasite lifecycle.

    a Novel Target'
- abstractText: |-
    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of a platform for the discovery of new anthelmintic (anti-parasite) drugs.  Drug resistance is occurring with all anthelmintics currently on the market.  Current drug development only introduces new molecules to the existing drug targets.  As a result, drug resistance quickly jumps to these new drugs, which makes them ineffective shortly after market introduction.  Without an adequate source of effective anthelmintics, livestock yields, crop damage, and human capital are starting to suffer. The social burden is creating economic losses totaling hundreds of billions of dollars worldwide.  By focusing on a novel drug target that controls entry into infective life forms, this proposal aims to generate a new class of anthelmintics to combat this growing problem. The drug companies that commercialize this potential new class of anthelmintics will access a market potential of $1.5 B per year or more.

    The SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop a platform for the discovery of new anthelmintic drugs using genetically engineered nematods (C. elegans).  The approach used will insert a segment of a parasite gene in replacement of a segment of a native gene.  The resulting chimera gene converts the C. elegans nematode into a form that better mimics the parasite state.  Drug hits found active on the chimera-expressing nematode are then refined into leads by testing for efficacy against parasite infection model.  The proposal's chimera platform is adapted to a diverse set of parasite genes.  The resulting diverse platform is expected to provide a rapid path to discovery and eventual introduction of a novel class of anti-parasite drugs with broad-spectrum activity.

    This Small Business Innovations Research (SBIR) Phase I proposal is to demonstrate the feasibility of using Miromatrix' perfusion decellularization technology to create a fully revascularized cardiac patch for the treatment of ischemic heart disease and congenital heart repair. While medical advancements have decreased the overall mortality rate for acute myocardial infarction (MI) patients, therapeutic options are lacking to address the underlying loss of myocardial tissue, resulting in a mortality rate greater than 33% at five years. For congenital repair, current surgical approaches for cardiac reconstruction utilize synthetic materials that do not have the ability to grow and remodel with the patient.  The proposed cardiac-derived revascularized cardiac patch may promote faster reconstruction of functional tissue by providing a fully perfusable scaffold with a composition and architecture similar to native cardiac tissue.

    The broader/commercial impacts of this research are the development of a revascularized cardiac patch to treat ischemic heart failure and congenital repair.  Inhibiting the onset or delaying the severity of heart failure will have a significant effect on reducing the treatment cost of heart failure, which currently is estimated at over $37 billion. This product with have significant advantages over existing technologies, including: 1) full thickness, biological, cardiac-derived matrix material; 2) vascular supply to support migrating cells and remodeling; 3) superior mechanical properties; and, 4) no need for immunosuppressive therapies. Moreover, this will be the first cardiac-derived, revascularized patch available for treating ischemic areas of the heart.

    Broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project  is to (1) improve the decision making towards protein therapeutics development (also known as developability), (2) reduce Research and Development costs for the Biotechnology industry in general, (3) improve timelines of new protein therapeutic candidates, thus proceeding to clinical phase trials sooner,  (4) resulting in fewer candidate withdrawals from clinical trials, (5) reduce risk associated with protein aggregation and immunogenicity, a potentially fatal outcome; leading to (6) overall quicker times for approval-to-market, and finally (7) a reduction of product recall risk. The market opportunity for protein characterization and identification market by instruments also known as life sciences tools is estimated to be $ 80-85 billion dollars. Our product is an innovative patented technology platform and related services which will support the developability evaluation of new protein therapeutic candidates in the biologics and biosimilars product portfolio. As an additional funding source, we have adopted the production of a high quality aggregate free potential diagnostic candidate biomarker for prostrate and pancreatic cancer to allow for further research and development in other research institutions.  Completion of Phase I in the evaluation of formulation conditions of protein therapeutics including monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) will ensure progress towards the development of a high throughput platform for Phase II evaluation.


    The proposed project will address the current bottleneck of new protein therapeutics within the biologics and biosimilars industry due to protein aggregation. This is the single most prevalent reason that has hampered the release of biotherapeutics into the market. Protein aggregation leads to loss of efficacy and potentially to immunogenicity risks.  Formulation is critical to downstream processing, dosing, storage, and delivery of protein therapeutics. Our goal is to test different formulation conditions through the use of Design of Experiment strategies to identify the formulation conditions under which the monoclonal antibody candidate is stable and aggregation free, even under stress.   We have designed an innovative patented platform using two dimensional infrared (2D IR) correlation spectroscopy and perturbation correlation (PC) analysis which is accurate, reproducible and does not use probes to determine the mechanism and extent of aggregation, and stability of a mAb. A potential outcome will be the developability assessment of novel candidates ensuring a pipeline of protein therapeutics early in the research and development. If successful, Phase II will involve a high-throughput platform to address the evaluation of protein aggregation in plasma and final IV delivery conditions, for the design of a predictive model for immunogenicity risk assessment.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will address the challenge of integrating two powerful single-cell analysis tools with the aim of developing and validating new biomarkers for malignancy. The deformability of invasive cells has long been hypothesized to confer their ability to migrate through tight tissue barriers and form metastases. Recently, this idea has been supported by mechanical measurements of cells either isolated from or directly in biological fluid specimens. This convergence of ideas from both biological and physical sciences represents a mechanical biomarker, and tools to be employed clinically to assay these properties are rapidly being developed. Cytovale?s technology measures cell deformability at a throughput of several thousand cells per second, comparable to the ubiquitous flow cytometer, which allows immediate measurement of cells directly in biological fluids. This technology has a demonstrated utility: highly sensitive detection of malignancy in cellularly heterogeneous clinical pleural effusions. Its integration with fluorescence in this project will provide a transformational research and clinical tool, well-aligned with the critical aims of improving patient care and reducing costs through automation, early detection of disease, and use of quantitative, novel biomarkers.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is realized by appreciating the applicability of the technology across research and clinical settings. Even without integration with fluorescence (flow) cytometry the technology has demonstrated its utility as a sensitive detector of malignancy in clinical specimens, specifically, pleural effusions. However, cell mechanics is an attractive biomarker for invasiveness, and is likely conserved throughout cells found in many biological fluids, including urine and fine needle aspirates. The proposed activity will further enhance the technology?s diagnostic accuracy. The instruments developed by Cytovale will be placed in clinical cytology labs to complement gold standard cytological methods, performing high sensitivity screens of biological fluids and eliminating unnecessary, invasive, and costly follow-up procedures. The hybrid instrument will also be an especially powerful tool for exploring connections between cell mechanics and traditional markers, which greatly extends the number of research laboratories which would benefit from this enabling technology.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in detecting sepsis early in its course, before end organ damage when it is most treatable. Sepsis, an uncontrolled systemic response to local infection by bacteria or fungi, is responsible for more deaths than prostate cancer, breast cancer, and AIDS combined and is associated with ~$17B in annual U.S. healthcare expenditures. We anticipate that providing emergency department physicians with an earlier diagnostic will profoundly influence clinical outcomes (currently ~40% mortality), costs (>$22,000/case), and the quality of life for survivors and their families. Accumulating evidence connects systemic immune activation ? a key process in sepsis ? with single-cell architectural changes that are mechanically measured by high-speed mechanical phenotyping technology. This technology is well-suited for adult sepsis screening in the emergency department (market size of $1.5B) due to: (1) the functional analysis of cell state the mechanical measurement provides, (2) its high achievable throughput and therefore statistical accuracy, (3) exceedingly short turnaround time, (4) low cost of goods, and (5) the clinically-actionable information it provides. Beyond the adult sepsis screening market, several additional indications include neonatal sepsis, bladder cancer detection, academic research tools, and drug development.


    The proposed project brings an innovative new class of biomarkers to bear on a problem that has been intractable with current biomarkers.  Briefly, the physical properties of cells have been known to be important for decades, but only with the advent of breakthrough microfluidic technology have we been able to measure these parameters in a high-throughput manner capable of diagnosing disease.  This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II award will be used to develop and validate innovative sample preparation and image analysis modules for a sepsis screening technology as well as performance of proof-of-concept clinical studies that would be a flagship offering in using biomechanical biomarkers to diagnose disease. The technical objectives are designed to improve sensitivity to white blood cells, activated during sepsis, by microfluidic automation of sample preparation and optimization of the microscopic imaging optics. In addition to preparing the test for practical implementation in the emergency department, the test will be validated with a proof-of-concept clinical study, and a clinical scoring system will be devised.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will support development and testing of a novel cost-effective mechanical ventilator. The H1N1 pandemic ignited concern in the healthcare community over the state of preparedness of our nation?s healthcare system in the event of a critical care emergency. If a 1918-like flu pandemic were to occur today, tens of millions of people could die from respiratory distress. Unfortunately, the United States does not have enough ventilators to support patients with respiratory distress. When considered on a global scale, the disparity in critical care and emergency resources between wealthy and impoverished nations is alarming. The goal of this proposal is to progress from a high-level prototype to pre-production status. Iterative performance testing and redesign will be followed by human factors validation and interface design with simulated use modeling. Completion of Phase I will place the company in a position to begin verification testing and validation of mechanical components and software in Phase II. The next step is regulatory approval following a 510k pathway and sales expected to begin within 2 years of the Phase I start date.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to conquer one of the most difficult problems in critical care: delivering high precision, high reliability and low cost in a mechanical ventilator. If a flu pandemic were to occur today, millions of people could die from respiratory distress. Unfortunately, the United States does not have enough ventilators to support patients with respiratory distress in even a mild pandemic. Respiratory illness is a leading cause of hospitalization and death in emerging nations. Each year thousands of patients die in rural community hospitals because of lack of access to mechanical ventilation. Despite improvements in infrastructure and economies, ventilators remain out of reach for many hospitals. At present, the mechanical ventilation market is more than $2 billion globally and growing at 7%. Commercialization of this novel ventilator design would provide a viable option for stockpiling ventilators in the event of a mass casualty event and hospitals in emerging markets will finally be able to afford high performance ventilation for their intesive care units.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop a cost-effective mechanical ventilator
    designed specifically to address the need for pandemic stockpiling and surge capacity
    use. The output of this Phase will be a new ventilator ready for FDA clearance
    and market entry in 2017. US government planners have described a need for many
    thousands of additional ventilators in the event of a pandemic influenza or other
    large-scale medical emergency. Severe influenza often leads to respiratory distress
    which cannot be dealt with in the absence of mechanical ventilation. Given some
    time and a mechanical ventilator, the human body can often clear the infection
    on its own. Without help from the ventilator, patients may die. Manufacturers
    of current ventilators have attempted to reconfigure their existing offerings
    to meet the stockpiling demand. Unfortunately none of these devices are able to
    match the price/performance ratio needed to make stockpiling in large numbers
    economically feasible. Building upon an innovative platform for mechanical ventilation
    developed in Phase I, the project intends to develop a ?gold standard? device
    for pandemic preparedness and emergency use. \n\nThe proposed project is to develop
    a novel and much needed medical device ? a mechanical ventilator suitable for
    pandemic use and emergency stockpiling. If a severe pandemic were to strike the
    United States, the number of patients in need of mechanical ventilation has been
    estimated to be over 700,000. Of these, the most severe cases are often in the
    very old and the very young.  There are currently 62,274 ventilators in use in
    the United States, of which only 23,485 are capable of supporting pediatric patients.
    Research and development activities will provide opportunities for creating new
    intellectual property, new technology, and new clinical methods for managing respiratory
    distress. This research and development project is divided into two Aims. In the
    first, the company will conduct extensive design research to analyze and understand
    the clinical need and all product requirements. We will then design, build, and
    test a series of prototype concepts using sophisticated software modeling, benchtop
    test platforms including mechanical and electronic lung simulation, and real-world
    user feedback. In the second Aim the company will address manufacturing and supply
    chain requirements, integrate design for manufacturing, and build and test a final
    series of near-production prototypes. These late-stage test procedures will include
    clinical performance and accuracy in accordance with regulatory standards, electromagnetic
    interference, and mechanical durability including vibration, noise, and water
    ingress in preparation for FDA regulatory clearance."

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will provide the basis for producing a unique cytocompatible, liquid adhesive bandage that will facilitate wound healing. This project is based upon a correlation of surface free energy of hydrated, amphiphilic polymers and their ability to support cell functions, such as growth and proliferation, deposition of extracellular matrix proteins, and patterns of substrate surface coverage and morphology.  Current commercially available liquid adhesive bandages for professional applications on humans are used in a variety of wound coverage applications. However, there is no liquid adhesive bandage commercially available for human use that serves as a cell substrate as well as protecting a wound from foreign contaminants. The research will determine the surface free energies of a variety of amphiphilic polymers, ranging from highly hydrophilic to highly hydrophobic, and then correlate the surface free energy data to the cytocompatibility of the respective polymer films.  It is anticipated that this approach will result in a selection of polymers in a narrow range of surface free energies that can accelerate tissue regrowth for wound healing.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the creation of a new form of medical treatment for acute wounds (e.g., surgery sites, injuries),  for chronic wounds (e.g., ulcers) and for burn wounds utilizing a simple, low cost, intimately conformal, protective polymer coating material that is capable of facilitating tissue regeneration. Such a coating will function as a synthetic skin substitute that will allow wounds to heal rapidly, without external contamination, such as from bacteria and other microorganisms, because of its ability to facilitate cell adhesion and proliferation. Importantly, this polymer coating will self-remove over time as the wound heals, in contrast to typical bandages that can cause new tissue abrasion and rupture when manually removed. This project will demonstrate how enhanced cytocompatibility of liquid adhesive bandages, and synthetic skin substitutes in general, can be obtained in topical wound care, thus leading to a reduction of patient suffering and a reduction in this nation's health care costs. The commercial impact of this product will be game-changing for topical wound treatment in that future materials should facilitate healthy tissue regrowth.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the expedited development of a novel non?]surgical medical device and therapeutic treatment for the approximately 1 in 3 women over the age of 30 who suffer from urinary incontinence, two thirds of whom, in part due to notable deficiencies of available solutions, elect to live without treatment while their symptoms progressively worsen. Urinary incontinence, although a very private concern, has far?]reaching physical, psychological, social, and economic implications. For example, urinary incontinence has been found to reduce health-related quality of life measures on par with depression, incontinence is the number one reason for admittance into nursing homes, and the annual cost to the US healthcare system is estimated at $25 billion. Through design and validation activities this project will demonstrate the functionality of a wearable device that provides discreet, comfortable, easy?]to?]use therapy for female stress urinary incontinence. The technological understanding gained through this work lays the groundwork for subsequent development of a commercially viable, FDA cleared product that will enhance the lives of tens of millions of American women.


    The proposed project provides a new framework for wearable therapeutics by enabling the patient to treat incontinence via discreet surface electrical stimulation without interruption to daily activity. Current non?]surgical care often involves electrical stimulation via intravaginal probe, a treatment most woman are not willing to adopt or maintain. The goal of this project is to demonstrate the ability of a contiguous array of cutaneous electrodes placed proximate the perineal tissue to deliver sufficient electrical muscle stimulation to promote pelvic floor toning, and further to maintain this efficacy under conditions associated with continuous wear. Building on a successful proof?]of?]concept prototype, multiple candidate designs will be developed, fabricated and validated using benchtop models. Testing will explore challenges with maintaining electrode?]skin contact during patient mobility and effective management of bodily fluids (i.e. leakage). Throughout the project, increasingly complex models will be utilized, concluding with assessment in human cadaveric tissue. The project is expected to identify a preferred candidate electrode design suitable for future evaluation in a human clinical study, FDA clearance and product commercialization.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop and commercialize a high resolution, protein-based retinal implant intended to restore vision to the millions of patients suffering from retinal degenerative diseases, particularly retinitis pigmentosa and age-related macular degeneration. These currently incurable and blinding diseases affect between 30-50 million people worldwide, and lead to a loss of independence for the individual, as well as an increased burden on their caregivers. Additionally besides the emotional and physical burden of vision loss, the cost of vision problems in the US alone is estimated at $139 billion. The work outlined in this SBIR proposal has the potential to significantly impact our understanding of retinal degenerative diseases, as well as the field of retinal prosthetics. The subretinal implant under development provides the framework for the next generation of high-resolution retinal prosthetics, while offering a cost-effective solution to vision restoration, and will help these patients regain independence and thus improve their quality of life.   ------------------

    The proposed project seeks to quantify the spatial resolution of a flexible, protein-based, ion-mediated retinal implant, as well as to perform an initial evaluation of the implant in vivo. The retinal implant under development is the first implantable technology to use the light-activated protein, bacteriorhodopsin, to convert light energy into an ion gradient that is capable of activating the remaining neural circuitry of the degenerate retina. The retinal implant will replace the function of the damaged photoreceptor cells. Spatial resolution will be evaluated ex vivo using excised retinas obtained from a transgenic rat model of retinitis pigmentosa. Extracellular microelectrode array experiments will be carried out to demonstrate the resolution of the implant, which is critical for meaningful vision. Safety and efficacy of the implant will be evaluated in vivo via a 6-week feasibility study on domestic swine. These in vivo studies are critical to establish the surgical procedures and biocompatibility and biostability of the implant in preparation for long-term, rigorous, preclinical efficacy testing of the implant as part of Phase II investigations. These experiments are critical value creation milestones that will demonstrate the commercial viability of the retinal implant under development.

    of medical costs of treating chronic retinal degeneration and limiting time with
    doctors will also be of benefit to the broad healthcare field.  The work outlined
    in this SBIR proposal also has the potential to significantly impact our understanding
    of retinal degenerative diseases, which will help in developing better and more
    effective treatments for a number of ophthalmic indications. The subretinal implant
    under development provides the framework for the next generation of high-resolution
    retinal prosthetics, while offering a cost-effective solution to vision restoration,
    and will help these patients regain independence and thus improve their quality
    of life. \n\nThe proposed project will expand on the data collected from the in
    vivo surgical development and ex vivo efficacy studies supported by our Phase
    I/IB awards.  First, a 40-animal rat study will be undertaken to further investigate
    the biocompatibility of the retinal implant.  Second, previously developed surgical
    procedures will be refined in pigs to ensure reproducible and safe subretinal
    implantation. Third, a high-throughput in vitro assay will be designed to investigate
    a number of implant parameters, as well as the integrity and biostability of the
    retinal implant using retinal pigment epithelial cells.   Additionally, medical
    device sealants will be investigated in this in vitro study, and the functional
    integrity of the implant will be measured using time-resolved absorption spectroscopy
    and an ion-sensitive detector, which is being developed specifically for this
    application.  Lastly, this ion-sensitive detector will provide an opportunity
    to further measure the spatial sensitivity of the retinal implant with high resolution.
    \ These in vivo and in vitro studies are vital for the continued evaluation of
    biocompatibility, surgical feasibility, and efficacy of the implant.  The results
    from these studies will further demonstrate the commercial viability of the technology
    under development."

    the development of a novel ultrasonic acoustophoretic separation technology that

    e.g., hydrocyclones, and membrane filtration, suffer from problems, such as high
    cost of energy, use of consumables, fouling, and limited efficiency in separation
    of micron-sized particles.  The proposed large volume flow rate acoustophoretic

    \ Ultrasonic standing waves are used to trap secondary phase particles in a fluid

    acoustic forces on the trapped particles results in concentration, agglomeration
    and/or coalescence of particles and droplets.  Heavier than water particles are
    separated through enhanced gravitational settling, and lighter particles through
    enhanced buoyancy.  This project combines experiment and computer modeling to

    This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I project is aimed at demonstrating that acyl glycinate surfactant can be produced by a novel bacterial fermentation route. The objective of this project is to construct a bacterial strain that produces acyl glycinate, and to provide a sample of that surfactant for commercial evaluation. A successful outcome will demonstrate that acyl glycine can be produced by fermentation. Surfactants are the bubbly components of cleaning products that give them their cleansing power. Surfactants are currently manufactured from petroleum or from seed oils, such as palm oil. The use of those raw materials increases greenhouse gas pollution and also leads to deforestation of rainforests. Retailers are demanding greener products, and regulatory agencies are demanding new minimally toxic chemicals. The demand for greener chemicals creates an opportunity to replace current surfactants with greener alternatives.

    The broader/commercial impact of the proposed innovation would be commercialization of the acyl glycinate surfactant. Additional benefits to society are that chemicals produced using this technology will be manufactured using domestically grown renewable raw materials, which do not compete with food sources. Furthermore, the energy required to produce these chemicals is low since the fermentation reaction is performed near ambient temperature. The chemicals are inherently safer than traditional chemicals because toxic solvents are not used, and the surfactants are biodegradable and do not contribute to increased greenhouse gas accumulation. Successful completion of the project will generate significant new scientific and technical information on new routes to making such surfactants.

    \ The acyl ethanolamine surfactant is designed to replace current commercial surfactants,
    which are contaminated, during the current manufacturing process, with the carcinogen
    1,4 dioxane.  The surfactant produced by the effort described here will not contain
    any 1,4 dioxane.  Successful completion of this project will demonstrate a new
    technology for the production of nonionic surfactants.  This is significant since
    nonionic surfactants represent about 40% of the $30 billion surfactant market.
    \n\nThe technical objective of this Phase I research project is to construct a
    Bacillus strain that produces an acyl amino alcohol surfactant, namely, acyl ethanolamine.
    \ Certain naturally existing peptide synthetase enzymes catalyze the linkage of
    particular amino acids to other particular amino acids.  In addition, certain
    peptide synthetase enzymes catalyze the linkage of particular fatty acids to particular
    amino acids.  Past work demonstrated that this system can be engineered to catalyze
    the creation of unique molecules, such as acyl glycinate (fatty acid linked to
    glycine).  During enzymatic synthesis of acyl glycinate, glycine is covalently
    attached to the synthetase via a thioester bond.  Product release is catalyzed
    by a thioesterse domain.  Release by a thioesterase results in production of fatty
    acid linked to the amino acid glycine.  Certain naturally occurring peptide synthetase
    enzymes use reductase domains to release products.  We hypothesize that release
    of acyl glycine via a reductase domain will result in the synthesis of acyl ethanolamine,
    rather than acyl glycine.  The objective of this Phase I project is to create
    a chimeric peptide synthetase enzyme that converts acyl glycine into acyl ethanolamine
    during the process of release of the product from the enzyme."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project involves a significant enhancement in the properties of wood polymer composites (WPCs) by the commercialization of a highly effective bio-based coupling agent made from renewable sources such as plant oils instead of petroleum. By significantly enhancing the properties of WPCs, substantial benefit to society will result by providing new application opportunities for these relatively low cost, light weight biocomposites.  Globally millions of metric tons of WPCs are produced each year.  Currently, WPCs are used for applications that do not require high load bearing characteristics due to limitations in modulus, strength, and creep.  The technical concepts proposed for the Phase I effort are expected to enable higher modulus and strength, by facilitating the use of higher wood flour (WF) loadings, as well as lower deformation by introducing crosslinks into the matrix phase.  Although this proposal is focused on the utility of these novel bio-based copolymers as high performance coupling agents, these copolymers have also been demonstrated to be excellent binders for coatings.  Thus, commercialization of these copolymers is expected to have a broader impact on society beyond use as coupling agents.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project will determine the feasibility of novel bio-based polymers to serve as highly effective coupling agents for WPCs.  The most common WPCs are based on WF as the dispersed-phase and high density polyethylene (HDPE) as the matrix.  WF is a very desirable reinforcement for composites because it is inexpensive, abundant, biodegradable, high modulus, high strength, light weight, and non-abrasive toward processing equipment. The major technical challenge for HDPE/WF composites is obtaining adequate compatibility between the WF fibers and the HDPE matrix.  Although the modulus and tensile strength of WF fibers is approximately 40 and 20 times higher than that of the HDPE matrix, respectively, the mechanical property enhancements provided by the WF cannot be fully realized without effective compatibilization.  It is the team?s belief that the bio-based polymers proposed for the project possess the ideal chemical composition for effectively coupling the HDPE matrix to the WF fibers to maximize mechanical properties.  In addition, the polymers are capable of introducing crosslinks into the matrix phase, which are expected to reduce polymer creep.  For the Phase I project, the effect of the chemical composition of the bio-based coupling agent will be a primary factor investigated.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is to provide the paint and coatings industry with new high-performance, cost-competitive polymer/resin systems that reduce solvent emissions and use of petrochemicals.  In addition, these new polymer/resin systems enable one-component, ambient-cure coatings to be produced.  This means that highly protective coatings can be produced without the need for mixing multiple components together prior to application or applying heat or light to cure the coatings.  The one-component, ambient-cure features of these polymer/resin systems largely eliminate waste and energy costs associated with coating application and lend themselves to the production of paints and coatings that can be applied by the average person.  Compared to the current state-of-the-art in one-component, ambient-cured resins, these new polymer/resin systems provide dramatically shorter drying times, dramatically better chemical resistance, and much higher film hardness, while exhibiting excellent impact resistance and flexibility.  The highly desirable properties of these new cost-competitive polymer/resin systems will enable commercial success, while their low solvent emissions and high renewable content will reduce impact on the environment.

    The objectives of this Phase II research project are to: 1) further optimize the polymer/resin systems to produce compositions that minimize solvent content and maximize performance, while meeting the cost constraints of the market; 2) put in place a pilot-line to provide potential customers with adequate sample sizes to enable their own evaluation of potential products, 3) generate weathering, corrosion, and storage/shelf stability data to further understand the application potential of optimized polymer/resin systems; and 4) optimize the polymer/resin production process to minimize cost and minimize production waste.  By meeting these objectives, the Phase II project will result in the generation of new polymer/resin systems that will enable the development and commercialization of new paints and coatings that are one-component, ambient-cured, low in solvent content that exhibit exceptional properties, while being primarily based on renewable materials.  Optimized polymer/resin systems will be provided to potential customers for their own internal evaluation.  If necessary, feedback from customer evaluations will be used to modify polymer/resin system composition to meet customer needs.  By the end of the Phase II project, the technology will be ready to proceed to manufacturing scale-up and product commercialization.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will support a new synthetic chemical approach for the creation of positron emission tomography (PET) imaging products to manage neurodegenerative disorders, cancer, and cardiovascular disease. Creating these imaging products relies on the rapid and efficient labeling of tracer molecules with a radioisotope ([18F]fluoride). The difficulties inherent in radiofluorination chemistry have severely limited the scope of radiotracers available for clinical use. This NSF SBIR Phase 1 project addresses this critical problem using the company?s proprietary single-step fluorination technology. This technology advances the current state-of-the-art with simple, fast, and highly efficient radiofluorination, permitting an entire new class of drugs to be labeled with no-carrier-added [18F]fluoride for the first time. The project will focus on the synthesis of clinically relevant radiotracers for pediatric cancer and Parkinson?s disease. Technical studies to be performed using this support include optimization of this new radiofluorination manufacturing methodology across multiple radiosynthesis platforms.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to provide technology to expand the scope of PET as a platform for determining the identification and staging of diseases, and assessing the efficacy of treatment regimens. PET is an underutilized diagnostic imaging technique that is stymied by the lack of highly efficient, broadly applicable radiofluorination methods. The radiotracer manufacturing technology developed here is extremely general and applicable to the preparation of new imaging agents for PET. The availability of this general labeling technique can also speed development of new drugs by providing in vivo biomarkers of new therapeutic agents which can be used to determine optimal dosing of new drugs and variability of biodistribution in target populations. The commercial potential of PET imaging is significant; the worldwide market for PET is expected to grow to $15 billion by 2015. There is also room for significant expansion of this market as new imaging agents become available.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to increase the effectiveness of oxidative enzymes of high potential in chemical synthesis and chemical remediation applications.  Enzyme-based systems, the greenest and most energy efficient processes known to-date, are replacing chemical-based systems due to their superior potential for energy savings and environmental benefits. While at the forefront of the green chemistry revolution, however, enzyme-based systems are difficult to come by. Their adoption has not been as fast, as widespread, or as beneficial as it otherwise could be because oxidative enzymes are not cost effective enough to replace chemicals. This project is developing an integrated technology for oxidative enzymes for industrial use. The project objectives consist of (1) manufacturing continuous flow reactors dedicated to processing ZYMtronix?s catalysts, (2) developing a synthesis process for key pharmaceutical precursors used in cancer treatment, and (3) demonstrating the remediation application for industrial contaminants. The anticipated technical results will benchmark reactor characteristics and the catalytic metrics of the aforementioned processes.

    The broader commercial potential of this project is to facilitate the adoption of oxidative enzymes in synthesis and remediation applications because they can replace precious metal catalysts, toxic solvents, and energy intensive processes.  Additional benefits translate to safer processes and products for manufacturers, consumers and the environment. ZYMtronix patent-pending technology is estimated to be substantially more efficient and cost effective to operate when compared with chemical systems, increasing enzyme activity, decreasing enzyme inhibition, and expanding the enzyme´s range of operable conditions. Combined with proprietary reactors being developed, the catalysts can be recycled for continuous use. ZYMtronix´s technology serves the fine chemicals, pharmaceutical, as well as the water remediation, markets applicable to oxidative enzyme processes.

    Research Phase II project is the commercial development of novel materials and
    processes for the immobilization of enzymes. The project is targeting enzymes
    as catalysts to be used in the manufacturing of active pharmaceutical intermediates
    (API). The use of enzyme for the production of pharmaceuticals has the potential
    to reduce cost, complexity and improve efficiency in making these products. The
    green, cost-efficient and scalable oxidative immobilized enzymes will benefit
    manufacturers by improving their production efficiencies and economics as well
    as minimizing adverse environmental impact. The technology could make benign oxidative
    enzymes commercially competitive replacing expensive precious metal catalysts,
    toxic, or other hazardous chemicals used in the production processes for APIs.
    The industrial applications for this technology could be broad well beyond the
    pharmaceutical arena. \n\nThe technical objectives of this Phase II research project
    are to (1) develop oxidative enzyme constructs and biocatalytic schemes for the
    production of high-value commercial active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs),
    (2) develop and produce magnetic macroporous scaffolds, and (3) improve operation
    of commercial reactors for continuous flow manufacturing or retrofit existing
    production processes using these magnetic catalysts with immobilized enzymes.
    This project enables immobilization to become a part of the selection process:
    enzymes can be selected for their true potential in their immobilized form by
    engineering enzyme immobilization with three levels of innovation: entrap commercially-available
    or third-party engineered enzymes into magnetic nanoclusters; create high-surface
    area scaffolds that stabilize the magnetic nanocluster assemblies,  providing
    cost and process advantages of maintaining the nanocluster assemblies in suspension
    magnetically.  This project is focusing on a high-potential, well-described and

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project explores an autonomous electrochromic (EC) window enabled by a visibly transparent photovoltaic coating technology. EC windows, which transition from a transparent state to a dark state (and vice-versa) based on an electrical input, represent a promising pathway to increasing building energy efficiency by effectively regulating the solar flux into the building. Though well-developed technologically, broad adoption of EC windows is limited by installation challenges rooted in a lack of autonomy (i.e. wiring to an external energy source, sensors, and control systems). The team has identified a key solution in which visibly-transparent photovoltaic coatings are integrated over the EC to serve as (1) an onboard energy source that harvests ambient light to power EC transitions, and (2) a photodetector that enables dynamic transparency control in response to changes in external lighting conditions. This project will demonstrate relevant performance and durability specifications of the photovoltaic coating to initiate large-area window integration and commercial deployment of autonomous EC windows.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is embodied by unprecedented freedom for architectural EC window adoption, which can reduce electricity consumption for cooling, lighting, and peak power demands in buildings by up to 15%-50%. By integrating power and sensing functionalities onboard with the EC window without impacting visual aesthetics, a fully autonomous insulated glazing unit (IGU) can be constructed that requires no specialized installation or external balance of systems. Ultimately this will significantly broaden adoption of EC windows, by eliminating concerns related to the cost and complexity of EC installation, thus improving payback period and simplifying the decision-making process within the supply chain of the built environment. Moreover, this project will result in the development of knowledge that will guide future generations of visibly-transparent photovoltaics for other products in which a local energy source and light detection functionality can provide significant value (e.g. electronic displays and mobile electronic accessories), enhancing the functionality of those products without impacting aesthetics.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a working prototype of a handheld detector for trace explosives that is smaller, more sensitive, and has faster response times than any commercially available portable device today. Under NSF Phase I SBIR funding of this project, Vaporsens, Inc. successfully developed new organic nanofiber sensory materials required to achieve these goals. In Phase II, the company will design and optimize the sensor systems, electronic hardware, firmware and algorithm software required to build a handheld detector. The novel nanofiber sensory materials developed by Vaporsens will enable the proposed detector to simultaneously detect all three important categories of explosives with greater sensitivity, due to detection limits in the parts per trillion range. Prototypes will be subjected to third party testing to validate the rapid, sensitive, and selective detection of common explosives. The Phase II project will also permit the design and fabrication of new sensor materials, with the aim of further improving the sensing sensitivity and selectivity of subsequent devices through interface chemistry optimization.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of the project will reduce the impact of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) which are a leading cause of casualties in contemporary warfare. IED use outside of warfare is growing, with over 170 incidents reported in the US alone during the first six months of 2013. As a result, the worldwide annual sales for trace explosives detection equipment has grown to approximately $400 million. However, these technologies are limited in their effectiveness. Swabbing machines require contact; bomb-sniffing dogs are expensive, need to work with the same handler, and have limited endurance; and imaging technologies are only practical in checkpoint settings due to size and expense. In contrast, the small size and high sensitivity of the proposed detector will be used for exacting detection of trace amounts of explosives in nearly any location, without swabbing, and at a cost that meets or exceeds the lowest price of detectors on the market. The commercialized device will be the first of its kind to allow local law enforcement and other public safety officials, border security and the military to "sniff" suspicious bags, vehicles, lockers, and people for dangerous explosive threats with immediate results regardless of their location.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project seeks to reduce the cost and complexity of incorporating energy-saving phase change materials (PCMs) into end-use products by developing a new class of form-stable PCM-modified resins that contain a unique reactive-polyolefin component. Importantly, the development of new PCMs for the passive thermal regulation of electric vehicle (EV) batteries has the potential to increase EV safety, range, and affordability, representing an addressable market currently valued at $87m and that is growing at 20% per year. Validation of these advantages should significantly benefit society by increasing electric vehicle performance and reducing the frequency of expensive battery replacement, thus increasing the adoption of energy efficient vehicles and reducing green-house gas emissions. This project can also result in an increase in the penetration of energy efficient PCM technology in additional markets worth a combined $370m, including building materials, textiles, electronics, and packaging, which can have a large positive economic impact on society. Finally, successful realization of the goals of this SBIR Phase I program will further enable scientific / technological understanding of PCMs that are based on organic materials.

    The intellectual merit of this project is the validation of a new paradigm for a bottoms-up approach to the design, production, and optimization of structurally-well-characterized reactive polyolefins of tunable molecular weight and narrow polydispersity that possess superior performance and stability characteristics as organic phase change materials (PCMs) for waste heat management as compared to conventional paraffin-based PCMs that have remained virtually unchanged for the past half century. To achieve this goal, reactive polyolefins that are the best candidates for commercialization will be identified through optimization of molecular structure, stereochemical tacticity, and the temperature and kinetics of main-chain and side-chain phase transitions. Reaction variables will also be optimized to provide the highest yields of reactive polyolefins under industrially-relevant and scalable process conditions. The development of PCM-modified thermoset resins based on reactive polyolefins will provide access to commercial waste heat management applications that employ physical constructs obtained from casting or injection molding and should benefit from lower production costs, a wider range of applications, and greater long-term stability.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Research Phase 1 project is to develop a new, cheaper process to mine gold and silver without using and polluting the environment with sodium cyanide. This will allow the development of new "green" mines, that are environmentally friendly and economically viable. The current state of the art is to use the 120yrs old sodium cyanide process carried out at vast scale worldwide. The new process, discovered at Northwestern University is being further developed by Cycladex. Gold and silver mining is still an important industry for the US with substantial yet untapped reserves and this new process if successful will generate jobs and increase the US development of its own resources. The proposed technology development with in this project will help directly address the environmental, economic, health and social impacts and benefits of current gold mining technology, improving workers' health and safety, enhancing the participation of local and indigenous communities and women and fostering sustainable mining practices in the developing and developed world. About 18% of all gold is still mined by the poor in the third world who use liquid mercury to extract gold.

    The objectives of this Phase 1 research are to develop a commercial process using the new Cycladex technology, prove the economics and to develop a manufacturing process, which can be scaled up at a gold mine. There are two parts to be developed, the initial extraction of gold using environmentally benign agents and then the isolation of the gold by crystallization using a commercially available natural product. The project will focus on establishing a novel and superior sustainable gold production process with high selectivity, productivity, capital cost and process economics compared to today's technologies.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is the potential to change the way gold mining is carried out by improving the process economics and reducing the environmental impact of mining operations. Current gold isolation methods involve the consumption of vast quantities of sodium cyanide, where cyanide is contained in large tailing dams, posing an environmental threat as exemplified by documented breaches. In the United States there are gold deposits which have not been exploited because of technology limitations and environmental concerns. The technology being developed in this project will improve the profitability of existing mines, as it can be employed with only minor changes in plant design. It will also  but will also lead to new jobs. Another opportunity is to extract gold from copper tailings dams. The proposed technology will potentially make cleanup of these sites profitable and can be applied worldwide. In the longer term, the process could be adopted in third world countries which still rely on mercury which pollutes, not only the environment, but also the food chain.

    The objectives of this Phase II research project are to (i) scale up the extraction of gold using both the heap and vat leach processes, (ii) optimize the crystallization of Au(III) in the presence of the natural product á-cyclodextrin, and (iii) isolate the gold. For heap leaching, it is proposed to operate at the 400-MT level, concentrate the gold salt and crystallize the gold-cyclodextrin complex. Scale-up will require designing the process to utilize existing equipment (built originally for the sodium cyanide process) and introducing new chemicals. For vat leaching, a small pilot system will be built to accept crushed ore as the feed, and the resulting gold-containing extract will be taken through the crystallization process. Optimization of the leaching agent, mass transfer, kinetics and materials consumption will be ongoing.  Regulatory approval for vat leaching, once secured, can be applied on-site globally to demonstrate the environmental and economic benefits of the process. This technology has the potential to significantly make existing and new mining operations more environmentally sustainable.

    demonstrate the feasibility of a revolutionary, low-cost, real-time, amperometric
    sensor technology based on bio-electrochemical systems. The proposed device utilizes
    exo-electrogen microbes to detect levels of target substances, primarily nitrate
    and oxygen. The sensor takes advantage of highly specific biological processes
    and the capability of certain microbes to transfer electrical current directly
    to electrodes. Because of the nature of the design, the sensor is low cost, requires
    no additional power, and continuously self-regenerates. These capabilities will
    enable sensors to be deployed in remote locations to monitor nitrate and oxygen
    levels in a network spanning large geographical regions.\n \nThe broader/commercial
    impacts of this research are in the environmental management, agricultural, and
    defense sectors. Nitrate levels in US waterways have increased dramatically in
    the past half-century. Nitrate in surface water run-off from agriculture activities
    is a particularly serious environmental problem, creating large anoxic dead zones
    and straining fisheries. Tracing this pollutant is difficult because existing
    sensors are very expensive or short-lived and cannot cover wide areas. Maintaining
    optimized levels of nitrate in sustainable precision agriculture not only reduces
    environmental impact, it is also a critical economic issue - nitrate monitoring
    in run-off from cropland can help to maximize yields while minimizing expensive
    fertilizer inputs. Finally, once proven for nitrates, the patented sensor concept
    has the potential to be adapted to other substances by utilizing additional capabilities
    of exo-electrogenic bacteria, thus producing a new class of amperometric sensors
    based on bio-electrochemical phenomena."

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project investigates a novel bioelectrochemical system for combined treatment of carbon and nitrogen in the wastewater of re-circulating and semi-re-circulating aquaculture facilities. The aquaculture industry is currently held-back by high levels of wastewater and expensive treatment technologies. Elevated levels of nitrogen versus carbon in aquaculture wastewater require several expensive and energy-intensive steps for complete treatment. Bioelectrochemical systems (BES) represent a new technology capable of treating wastewater in an energy-positive manner while producing fewer byproducts than existing technologies. The project will construct and evaluate a novel three-cell BES that can treat several of the most important water pollutants in a combined, energy-positive step. Phase I will prove feasibility of the technology and quantify system performance. Phase II studies will develop detailed designs and begin pilot studies at IntAct or in the field, pending Phase I results.

    The broader/commercial impacts of this research are to demonstrate a novel approach to aquaculture wastewater treatment with the potential to significantly enhance the economic of re-circulating and semi-recirculating aquaculture systems. Fish farming is emerging as a critical 21st century industry, with global annual production already more than 60 million tons. Yet industry growth is constrained by competition for water and the high cost of wastewater treatment technologies. By reducing energy-intensiveness and combining treatment processes, bio-electrochemical systems have the potential to greatly enhance the economics of re-circulating and semi-recirculation aquaculture facilities and the environmental sustainability of the industry.

- abstractText: |-
    This SBIR Phase I project will develop an anaerobic digestion system which utilizes bio-electrodes to more efficiently convert wastewater into biogas and ultimately energy.  Bio-electrochemical systems have received significant attention in recent years with the discovery of electricigen microbes capable of transferring electrons to and from electrodes at high rates. To date, most research has focused on using these processes in fuel-cell-like devices to produce electricity or hydrogen. In this project, IntAct will build and demonstrate a simplified process for enhanced anaerobic digestion based on adding electrodes and applying voltage directly into an AD chamber. The resulting proprietary system makes use of an applied voltage to modulate the growth of electricigen microbes on electrodes thus overcoming thermodynamic limitations to methane production and enabling pH control.

    The broader/commercial impact of the proposed project will be the ability to recover increased amounts of energy from the wastewater treatment process.

- abstractText: "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will
    continue the development of a low-cost real-time bio-electrochemical nitrate sensor
    for surface water monitoring initially funded as an NSF SBIR Phase I project.
    In Phase I, Cambrian Innovation demonstrated the feasibility of a bio-electrochemical
    sensor for measuring the level of nitrate in a water sample. Following the initial
    proof-of-principle, a microscale sensor prototype was developed and tested. The
    Phase II project will continue the development of the bio-electrochemical nitrate
    sensor to reach a detection level of less than 1 mg-N/L with a stable deployment
    of 6 months. Phase II development will optimize the sensor architecture and operational
    conditions for improved performance and develop a long-lasting substrate for microbial
    growth. Phase II will also include the design and construction of prototype electronic
    components, including the signal processing algorithm for interpreting the signal
    emitted by the bio-electrochemical cell. Finally, the sensor performance will
    be validated by extensive laboratory testing under controlled conditions followed
    by the initiation of field testing. Upon Phase II completion, Cambrian will be
    prepared for final development and testing of a first-generation nitrate sensor
    system in a Phase IIB project. \n\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of
    this project addresses environmental nitrogen management, one of the most pressing
    issues facing society in the 21st century. Nitrate contamination of waterways
    has become a high profile topic due to anoxic dead zones and drops in fish populations.
    A significant portion of this environmental impact has been attributed to agricultural
    run-off (USGS, DOI, 2000). The need for regulation, monitoring, enforcement, and
    remediation of nitrate pollution is limited by a lack of cost-effective technology
    for continuous monitoring of nitrate in the environment. Simultaneously, an increased
    thrust in precision agriculture has been fueled not only by environmental concerns
    but also by the dramatic improvements in crop yield and quality that can be obtained
    through careful control of nutrient addition. The development of a low-cost real-time
    nitrate sensor will transform the management of agricultural facilities, resulting
    in dramatic improvements in fertilizing efficiency and the environmental impact
    of the food production industry. Cambrian Innovation is developing a bioelectrochemical
    nitrate sensor to fill this unmet need and establish a new paradigm in environmental
    sensing."

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will optimize and pilot test a novel, energy-positive approach to de-nitrification for the global aquaculture industry. Recirculating aquaculture systems suffer from high wastewater treatment costs. Leveraging recent advances in bio-electrochemical systems, Cambrian's de-nitrification technology is capable of simultaneously treating chemical oxygen demand (COD) at end of pipe and nitrates in culture tank water while generating electricity directly. Phase I R&D demonstrated the existence of exo-electrogenic microorganisms in aquaculture wastewater. A flow through reactor consistently treated nitrate to below EPA drinking water concentrations (10mg/L) while removing an average of 65% of end-of-pipe COD and generating over 96 Amps/m3. An economic analysis demonstrated potential operating savings of over 70%, and significant bio-security benefits, versus competing systems. Phase II R&D will focus on optimizing treatment rates and reactor parameters with partner firms, and piloting a scaled reactor at an Aquaculture farm.

    The broader impacts of this research are to introduce technologies and strategies that solve water and energy problems for the recirculating aquaculture industry. With the collapse of fisheries globally, the aquaculture industry is poised to fill an important gap in our food production. However, recirculating systems in particular are under pressure to limit environmental harm caused by water intensity and pollution. Bio-electrochemical systems represent a novel approach to turn waste resources into energy, thereby increasing farmer?s bottom line and resolving the tension between economics and sustainability. Future research can broaden applications to other industries.

The delivery times and the content of supportive messaging will adapt and vary depending on the projected treatment progress. Our machine learning based system will be trained incrementally as more data becomes available over time, thus it will benefit from improved accuracy over time. We will extract local, semi-local, and global temporal features at multiple temporal resolutions and will use feature selection techniques to identify which factors contribute to the success of treatments for patients, and to predict if a user is improving or is deteriorating. This will result in adaptive motivational messages and recommendation for tailoring treatment in term of important identified treatment features.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to improve the treatment and decrease the high costs associated with treating patients who suffer severe traumatic brain injuries. This project aims to develop an accurate, affordable (<$100 per use) and non-invasive device to monitor a patient?s intracranial pressure following traumatic brain injury. Increased intracranial pressure can result in serious condition or death, if left untreated. However, the only available method to monitor intracranial pressure is expensive (~$10,000 per patient) and requires neurosurgery. The lack of a method to accurately screen patients to determine who needs surgery results in misdiagnoses and incorrect treatment in about 46% of patients among an estimated 50,000 patients in the US alone, and hundreds of thousands more globally. Successful commercialization of product is expected to result in savings in the range $250 million ever year to the US healthcare system.

    The proposed project will test the feasibility of developing a non-invasive intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring method for use outside of the neuro ICU. To develop an accurate, affordable, and non-invasive ICP monitoring device, the team will first write and validate a software framework that analyzes Cerebral Blood Flow Velocity (CBFV) waveforms. CBFV waveforms are acquired non-invasively by using transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasonography. In order to use CBFVs to predict ICP, two novel signal-processing methods will be developed. First, the high noise levels typical to TCD-acquired waveforms will be reduced within a machine-learning framework. Second, we will use a method to track morphological features that predict ICP from the CBFV waveform. Both these approaches to signal processing to analyze CBFV waveforms are entirely novel. This approach is expected to allow for accurate (>92% of area under the diagnostic ROC) non-invasive real time monitoring at an affordable price point that is within current reimbursement limits for TCD procedures.

    The proposed project will develop a medical device to accurately display a patient's intracranial pressure non-invasively and for use outside of the neurocritical care unit. The core technological approach of the proposed work is the analysis of blood flow velocity waveforms using advanced signal processing methods in a machine-learning framework. The machine-learning framework allows experience-based learning utilizing prior, established databases of waveforms that have been well-characterized. Three new machine-learning paradigms that utilize the shape features of the blood flow velocity waveforms will be utilized to progressively increase accuracy of intracranial pressure estimation. The first will establish a basic estimate using shape features of individual waveform pulses, considered independent of neighboring pulses. Subsequently, clinically established features of the waveform will be utilized to learn causal changes in the shape features resulting from changes in intracranial pressure. Finally, the shape features in successive pulses will be used as a sequence to machine-learn the intracranial pressure estimate. Together, these will enable increased accuracy in estimation. All of the methods proposed in this program are entirely novel. This approach allows for real time monitoring at an affordable price point that is within current reimbursement limits for ultrasonography procedures.

    and emergency department visits) who are experiencing nausea, dehydration, neutropenia
    and other side effects. The project seeks to obtain patient symptoms and report
    them to providers for potential earlier intervention and outcome improvement.
    The methods to be employed include assembling an expert panel, creating software
    and then conducting a feasibility trial. Key goals include demonstrating the feasibility
    of obtaining patient symptoms and that providers find the information useful and

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is very significant. Suboptimal operational decision-making in emergency departments leads to inefficiencies that result in extreme patient wait-times, the diversion of ambulances to other emergency departments, wasted resources and patients who either leave before being treated or against medical advice. By connecting modern analytical approaches, including statistical modeling and systems engineering methods, to real-time data routinely collected in emergency departments, the proposed project promises to result in a tremendously valuable analytics platform that will assist emergency departments in making dozens of operational and staffing decisions each day. This informed decision-making will not only improve emergency department efficiency, it will lead to both healthier and more satisfied patients and simultaneous dramatic increases in revenue and profit. The technology proposed will have the potential to add significant value to the approximately 5,000 emergency departments in the U.S., often on the order of millions of dollars annually. Hospitals and health systems now realize the value of effective analytics, and the analytics platform proposed here will be an obvious investment for any emergency department whose goal is to provide the best care to its patients at lower costs.

    The proposed project promises to yield a decision-support platform upon which emergency departments will base their decisions each day. Substantial investments by hospitals and health systems on information technology, and in particular, electronic health records, have set the stage for evidence-based, data-driven decisions. These decisions will effectively leverage real-time data along with analytical methods such as statistical forecasting and event-simulation modeling. In particular, this proposed project will create a software platform, based on these analytical methods and linking to real-time data sources, tailored to emergency departments. This project will involve 1) understanding the capacity and real-time availability of data in emergency rooms, 2) developing a statistical and simulation modeling platform that maximizes the potential of these data, in real-time, and specifically reflects emergency departments, and 3) ultimately ensuring that actionable insights are delivered in a timely and intuitive manner to key stakeholders. These actionable insights that derive from the data and sophisticated methods must be delivered to the right decision-maker at the right time and in the right format, but will then have the capacity to substantially improve both the quality and efficiency of care-delivery in an emergency department.

    of devices from powerful personal computers to mobile devices. \n\nThe broader
    impact/commercial potential of this project is to translate novel research using
    quantitative imaging biomarkers into actual clinical practice. Medical imaging
    is commonly used for cancer screening, treatment planning, and monitoring but
    the results that come from purely qualitative interpretations of these images
    are not always definitive. Recent progress has shown that high-throughput extraction
    and analysis of advanced quantitative imaging features from medical images (?radiomics?)
    can be used to increase the accuracy and confidence of cancer screening in certain
    cases. The goals of this project are to incorporate these analytics into a commercially
    available system for medical image display and distribution which is necessary
    for widespread clinical adoption. These advances will enable health care providers
    to lower costs associated with unnecessary follow up exams as well as to improve

- abstractText: |-
    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to significantly improve the care of cancer patients by providing an integrated platform for clinical data and image analytics to their care providers for better clinical decision making. Tight integration of clinical data with radiology images will enable evidence-based approaches to be used by care providers in oncology. The tools being developed in this project will enable accelerated transition of comprehensive data-driven cancer research into clinical practice for decision making related to diagnosis and treatment of cancer. Recent trends, such as wide adoption of electronic medical records and radiological images and availability of powerful computing at reasonable prices have made it possible to improve the prognostic and diagnostic power of data, in particular imaging data analysis in healthcare.  The integrated analytics platform being developed will streamline treatment monitoring by imaging and reduce diagnostic errors; hence increasing the quality to cancer care.

    The proposed project aims to develop an integrated, minable, clinical and imaging data analytics platform for oncology. The platform combines recent advances in data mining, context search, image segmentation and deformable registration into an imaging system deployed at the point of care. The diagnostic potential of clinical and image data will be enhanced by the ability to compare lesion characteristics of the current case to a large repository of lesions from other studies with known diagnosis. The proposed search tool will generate patient cohorts with a given set of diagnosis and treatment conditions and present the related images to the diagnostician. Additional technology will locate and track tumors and provide detailed characterization such as size, shape, location and texture with detailed analytics. A large, minable database of segmented tumors and detailed metrics will advance research into identifying ?imaging biomarkers?. The embedded imaging platform will allow clinicians to access these decision support tools across a wide spectrum of devices from powerful personal computers to tablets and other mobile devices.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve our ability to fight infectious diseases that negatively impact agricultural yields and reduce the efficiency of global food production and distribution systems. This innovation will enhance scientific and technological understanding by leveraging the power of high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics to provide a pathogen identification and surveillance tool with demonstrated efficacy against known and unknown infectious agents. This platform is fast, sensitive, and cost-effective, and can be used for any animal sample to detect virtually all possible microbes ? even microbes that have never before been characterized. Hundreds of samples can be rapidly screened without relying upon known genetic/genomic data of microbes. The global molecular diagnostics market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 14% from 2012 to 2017, with infectious disease testing being the leading application at 26% share, therefore the commercial opportunity of this project is vast.


    The proposed project tackles problems arising from low-throughput targeted detection technologies such as PCR, hybridization arrays, and culture. Current diagnostic methods rely on what is already known about target microbe genetics, and provide limited information in the form of presence/absence of a known target sequence. The proposed research objectives are related to lowering the technical risks associated with a high-throughput unbiased pathogen detection platform based on DNA sequencing and Bayesian statistics. The ultimate goal is to develop, standardize and validate our metagenomics pathogen identification platform for use in agricultural detection and biosurveillance contexts, using aquaculture related fish species and their infectious agents as a relevant application. This project  proposes to: 1) characterize relative performance of sequencing platforms for pathogen identification; 2) validate and benchmark our agricultural detection platform using fish samples and spike-ins diagnosed using established methods; and 3) evaluate the use of host gene expression signatures as supporting evidence for infection. The team will obtain metagenomic sequence data from infected fish, compare their analysis results against current methods, and establish the limit of detection using known quantities of pathogenic material.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project includes innovations in data mining and the treatment of autism.  Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) therapy is the gold standard in treating autism.  Applying data analytics to data from ABA therapy sessions will contribute in several important ways:  a) patterns may be discerned across individuals with autism to better understand variations in autism and create therapies to target these differences; b) patterns may be matched with other data, such as genomic data, to identify cross-patterns that may be useful in better understanding autism and ways to improve therapy; and c) the frontiers of data mining will be expanded to provide guidance in real time. This project will have the following societal impacts: 1) many more individuals with autism across the globe will receive early, quality, cost-effective treatment regimens that will enable them to live more fulfilled lives and reach their full potential; 2) families whose children are good candidates for treatment and receive it will experience reduced stress and better family life; and 3) the additional lifetime cost of not effectively treating children with autism, which is approximately ten-fold the cost of treatment, will be reduced.

    The proposed project is to extract informative sequential patterns from trial sequences of an individual student, use them to accurately predict trial outcomes, and utilize the predictive model to provide individualized recommendations about how to modify trials and steps of student training. To achieve this goal, predictive data mining will be used. To develop accurate predictive models, the project will build on a large body of recent work in machine learning on temporal predictive modeling and sequential pattern mining, including some of the previous results of the project team. Special attention will be paid to the recent work in educational data mining and intelligent tutoring. Specific key objectives include: 1) Representation of Trial Data for Predictive Modeling: how to represent the raw sequential data in a way that is most suitable for prediction modeling; 2) Development of Models for Prediction of Trial Outcomes: which model is the most suitable for prediction of outcomes in sequential trials and how to train a prediction model from highly-dimensional multi-therapy recipient sequential data; and 3) Guiding Therapy of a Child with Autism Based on an Early Classification Model: how to adjust and extend the previously developed approach by the project team to guide trials.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will revolutionize the treatment of individuals with autism. One of every sixty-eight US children has autism (over 1.1 million). The estimated cost of providing Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) therapy to those who could benefit is $7.5 billion dollars annually. Societal impacts include: 1) more individuals with autism across the globe will receive treatment regimens that will enable them to live more fulfilled lives and reach their full potential; 2) families whose children are good candidates for treatment and receive it will experience reduced stress and better family life; and 3) the additional lifetime cost of not effectively treating children with autism, which is approximately ten-fold the cost of treatment, will be reduced. Because high-quality, contextually rich ABA performance data will be collected for the first time, efforts to apply data analytics will contribute in two important ways: a) patterns may be discerned across individuals with autism to better understand variations in autism and create therapies to target these differences; b) expansion of the frontiers of data mining to provide guidance in real time will contribute to a number of areas within and beyond ABA therapy.

    The proposed project will optimize therapy outcomes for individuals with autism by transforming agent-based guiding technology into an adaptive and intelligent ABA therapy assistant for supervisors and instructors. The project pushes the boundaries in providing cost-effective, adaptable, intelligent, real-time guidance and data-collection support to instructors that integrates naturally into the instructional process and is easy to learn and use. ABA therapy experts, supervisors and instructors will verify the analyses and resulting guidance incorporated into the technology.  Advanced theories of usability engineering, including some developed by the project team, will be used to build interfaces that supervisors and instructors can intuit without the need for learning new concepts and syntax. The project will utilize the collected logs from multiple sessions with multiple therapy recipients and multiple therapy providers to uncover hidden patterns and assist supervisors in selecting appropriate therapy steps personalized for the individual with autism. The project will build on a large body of recent work in visualization, machine learning on temporal predictive modeling and sequential pattern mining, including some of the previous results of the project team. Special attention will be paid to the recent work in educational data mining and intelligent tutoring.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on using analytics and technology to drive greater efficiency and effectiveness in healthcare. Recent legislative changes are driving all players within the healthcare ecosystem toward greater accountability. This Phase I project specifically includes technologies to automatically assess patient risk and thereby reduce post-discharge readmissions rates. This Phase I project has the potential to support a broad range of customers across both the provider and the payer landscape, by providing cost-effective readmissions control solutions that respond to new legislative pressures. In terms of commercial potential, the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies has estimated that preventable hospital readmissions account for $20 billion/year in wasteful healthcare spending. The addressable market for the proposed Phase I proof-of-concept for patient risk stratification to support readmission control is approximately $100MM. In the future, this research project will serve as a foundation to support broader population health analytics, the addressable market for which exceeds $500MM/year and is growing at a rate of 24% annually.

    The proposed project aims to develop a data mining system to capture and analyze information from electronic medical records in order to risk-stratify patients after they have been discharged from hospital. Leveraging interoperability standards that are required by federal regulation, the system will seamlessly aggregate data from multiple electronic medical record systems in a vendor-agnostic manner. A custom analytics engine will detect emergent patterns and draw inferences about each patient?s risk of readmission. If successful, this research will validate the end-to-end concept and suggest the broader applicability of this approach to some of the greatest challenges in population health.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on using analytics and technology to benefit patients who require recovery care to get fully well after being discharged from the hospital. Transitions of care from acute (hospital) to post-acute (short-term rehabilitation and skilled nursing) settings impact millions of Americans every year. Seniors overindex on utilization of post-acute care, as a consequence of natural age-related degeneration and the need for longer recovery periods. By improving post-hospital coordination of care across the continuum, clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction stand to improve for America?s aging population. If successful, this project will help reduce costs of care for healthcare providers, payers, and government/society.

    The proposed project aims to incorporate and improve upon methods for user-centered data capture in healthcare.

- abstractText: |-
    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is significant; transitions of care impact millions of Americans every year. The healthcare system bears substantial cost and inefficiency&#8232;on account of suboptimal care transitions and overspending. This Phase II project will support progress towards a "learning healthcare system" and will extend the capabilities of data mining and machine learning in healthcare

    The proposed project seeks to improve data mining technologies for healthcare decision support. This project will focus on the analysis of a broad variety&#8232;of data types that are common in healthcare settings. The anticipated improvements would allow frontline care staff, operational managers, and healthcare executives to assess and make stronger evidence-driven decisions regarding quality, cost, and access as patients move through the healthcare system. The enhanced data mining system would utilize state-of-the-art pattern recognition and machine learning techniques to dynamically process and interpret clinical, claims, and other types of healthcare data. If successful, this research will impact the state-of-the-art in healthcare analytics.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on using analytics and technology to benefit patients who require additional care to fully recover - or simply to maintain their health - after being discharged from the hospital. Whether subacute or community-based care, significant opportunity exists to leverage machine learning, decision science, and advance data mining techniques to better support patients. State and federal budgets cover the costs of care for millions of Americans every year. This expenditure is growing faster than inflation, prompting the development of both optional and mandatory payment reform efforts that stand to simultaneously reduce costs and improve care outcomes. If successful, this project will help reduce costs of care for healthcare providers, payers, and government/society.

    The proposed project aims to incorporate and improve upon user-centered decision science in healthcare. The proposed platform will combine advanced machine learning techniques with a patient/family-centered business model. The innovation will harness multiple streams of healthcare data, such as claims/billing data from acute, subacute, and community care settings. If successful, this research will impact the state-of-the-art in healthcare analytics and outcomes measurement.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase I project will develop a small set of pioneering
    applications that teach science in awe-inspiring holographic 3D space. Students
    will put on their holographic glasses and explore fundamental scientific concepts
    and phenomena in unparalleled ways. For example, learners will be able to touch
    elusive subatomic particles in holographic 3D, dissect living cells to observe
    cellular processes, dive into the incredibly hot core of massive stars to witness
    the creation of heavy elements during thermonuclear fusion, or explore what happens
    when two galaxies collide. The project could take science education to the next
    level because it will trigger the much needed ?Aha!\" moments in science classrooms
    as learners go to impossible places where no book or teacher could ever take them,
    and explore concepts and phenomena that are difficult to grasp in any other way.
    The project is envisioned to contribute significantly to science education nationwide
    while creating numerous hi-tech jobs and generating tax revenue.  \n\nThis is
    one the first projects that will develop holographic applications specifically
    for science education. The final result of the project will be a set of mixed-reality
    holographic 3D applications that lets students explore and understand scientific
    concepts and phenomena and help them overcome stubborn misconceptions in science.
    Intelligent avatars will guide students through thought-provoking scientific explorations
    and continuously assess their learning. Students can interact with the avatar
    in natural ways: by manipulating objects in the virtual environment or by clicking
    buttons and constructing sentences. In teacher-guided mode the avatar can be turned
    off and the teacher can lead the exploration. Stunning visuals will make the experience
    unforgettable for learners while educators receive detailed visual reports on
    each student's progress. The efficacy and the explaining power of the holographic
    environment will be assessed in rigorous controlled trials. The project is envisioned
    to generate a significant amount of intellectual property as key components of
    the system will be protected by patents and all 3D models and storylines will
    be protected by copyright. This creates significant barriers for any competitor
    trying to penetrate our market or emulate our technology."

  title: 'SBIR Phase I:  Holographic Explorer for In-Depth Science Learning'
- abstractText: |-
    This SBIR Phase I project will develop a prototype system that teaches children how to solve seemingly hopeless mathematical problems. Problems differ from exercises in that it is not immediately clear how to approach them. They require hard thinking, not complicated calculations. For example, the system's intelligent avatar will help students discover a method to calculate the Earth-Moon distance with nothing more than basic geometry and a lot of thinking and experimentation. Problems are presented by the avatar in 2D or in captivating 3D virtual worlds. The joy of (guided) discovery is envisioned to increase students' interest in math and other STEM disciplines and to significantly reduce math anxiety. The new rigorous math education standards require strong problem solving skills from each student including at-risk populations. The steady increase of student population also puts enormous pressure on schools to assist the work of their teachers. It is envisioned that the system's unique advantages over competitive solutions could ultimately make it a "must have" for the nation's 132,000 schools educating 58 million K-12 students. The project is expected to contribute to a markedly better math education.

    The most important technical innovations of this project are the emulation of natural-style teacher-student interactions in the domain of mathematics education, the teaching of proven problem solving strategies by an expert avatar, and the use of immersive 3D virtual worlds to help develop deep insight and advanced problem solving skills. The goal of the Phase I research is to develop a prototype system and scientifically evaluate its promise to improve students' problem solving skills in grades 6-8 within the context of the content domains and standards of mathematical practice specified by the Common Core State Standards.  The system's Socratic avatar asks students purposeful questions in relation to a given problem. Students respond in a variety of constrained ways: construct written answers by dragging and dropping words into the right place, or by manipulating objects in the virtual environment. Student reasoning skills are tested continuously and non-intrusively during teach the avatar sessions in which roles are reversed and students demonstrate to a novice avatar how to solve a given problem. This will reveal a wide range of knowledge gaps in conceptual understanding and the use of particular mathematical methods. The researchers will analyze students' improvement in a pretest-posttest control group experiment.

    effortlessly discover methods for finding the shortest path between two points
    on the surface of a sphere, which is a difficult geometry problem. Teachers can

    skills at the same time, as well as its capability to non-intrusively assess students
    during the mathematical explorations is also unmatched. During the Phase II project,
    the commercially viable software will be fully developed and its efficacy to improve
    students' mathematical problem-solving skills will be thoroughly researched. A
    pretest-posttest control group experiment will be conducted in authentic education

    This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I project aims to provide a cloud based software platform to deliver entrepreneurship education at scale. Innovation is the first step along the journey towards commercialization, job creation and profitability. On a good day this path is dark, winding, uphill and unpaved. At LaunchPad Central, they are rapidly creating the ability to help pave this road to increase the odds of successfully navigating this journey. The data from early stage startups will add to the "intellectual exhaust" allowing for pattern recognition of early warning signs of failure. The LaunchPad Central team has the domain expertise required to architect this platform. Collectively they possess an in-depth understanding of the requirements. A world-class board of advisors including Steve Blank, author of The Four Steps to Epiphany and the Startup Owners Manual (standard entrepreneurship texts across top universities worldwide) gives the company an unparalleled intellectual advantage on best practices to deliver this content at scale. The company has the experience of teaching this process in classroom and synchronous online formats to graduate engineering, MBA students and scientists/researchers from research universities. This has given the team considerable collective intellectual and operational experience.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project can be significant. The NSF Innovation Corps program has adopted Steve Blank's Lean LaunchPad process in 2011. One hundred NSF I-Corps funded teams have graduated and are on their way to successfully commercializing their lab research. The program is set to scale over the next 18-24 months. LaunchPad Central enables the successful scale of this program for early stage technologies from the top universities to learn how to navigate the financial valley of death as they seek to commercialize their science in scalable and sustainable ways.  LaunchPad Central will have a much broader impact for entrepreneurs on Main Street. The Small Business Administration could offer the tools that have been tried and tested by Silicon Valley entrepreneurs. Decreasing the odds of failure for small businesses (the backbone of the US economy) can have a profound impact on job creation. Scalable startups have historically grown from innovation and entrepreneurship hubs like Silicon Valley, Boston etc. Their software provides the metrics to identify promising entrepreneur across the country and potentially connecting them to mentors and investors in Silicon Valley.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop and test a construction kit toy and accompanying activities for teaching and learning engineering design synthesis. Routine engineering analysis can be automated, but design synthesis still remains largely the province of creative and knowledgeable human beings.  The problem is that design synthesis is taught poorly, if at all. Construction kit toys offer a way to solve this problem: they invite young people into engineering design synthesis in playful yet intellectually challenging ways.   Beyond teaching specific domain knowledge, construction kits engage young learners in goal-directed experimental exploration, acquiring and practicing skills central to creativity and invention in engineering design. Current mechatronics construction kit toys are either too simple or limited to allow serious designing, or they are powerful but so technically demanding as to exclude many who otherwise might like to play. The specific innovation of our EYVO construction kit for mechatronics through elegant encapsulation of function and simplicity of physical design?will dramatically lower barriers for young people to engage significantly with engineering design synthesis.  This project will develop the EYVO prototype and accompanying educational materials, test it with children, and investigate its commercial potential.


    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is as follows. Throughout the twentieth century the US led the world in science and technology innovation, but this competitive advantage is steadily eroding.   US children lag behind peer nations in STEM knowledge and skills, crucial for the nation?s technological leadership and economic future. Many young people are discouraged from pursuing STEM interests because, despite interest, early encounters lead them to believe that they have poor aptitude.   They turn away (or feel excluded) from STEM fields because the barriers to entry seem too high or because they think it?s boring or difficult. Unlike competing products such as LEGO Mindstorms, VEX Robotics, and Meccano the EYVO construction kit developed in this project invites young people to engage immediately?without prologue and without need for prior technical proficiency?in serious yet playful engineering design.  Through play with EYVO they can learn that engineering design is fun, and more importantly, a domain in which they can excel.   By making the kit affordable to individuals, schools, and informal science institutions, the project will make engineering design synthesis skills attractive and accessible to populations that historically have largely been excluded from, or disinterested in, STEM learning.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project investigates end-user programming for ensembles of robots. The project focusses on the developmnent of an accessible end-user programming environment so that middle and high school students can create their own custom ensembles or blocks of robots and observe how the blocks' behavior affect an entire robot. Building powerful and correct intuitions about the behavior of complex systems is important for scientists and engineers, but with today's technologies it is difficult for children to acquire and integrate these ideas into their mindset. Through exploratory play with thr proposed robotics construction kit, which embodies a distributed processing scheme for embedded microprocessors, children can build and observe complex systems acting in the real world. Programming such systems is difficult: the problem to be solved is to identify effective end-user programming paradigms for children to program distributed embedded systems, and thereby construct mental models about the behavior of complex systems. Although end-user programming environments exist for software systems, and even for a few robotics toys, no competing approach to end user programming tackles distributed processing for modular robotics. The project aims to build three experimental systems: a text-based environment, a visual programming language, and a 'cellular automata' interface. Testing with local middle school students will determine the benefits and drawbacks of each approach.

    The outcome of the project is expected to have a broad impact on children's understanding of how complex global behaviors emerges from local effects. Designing and building complex systems exposes children to a variety of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) concepts. The addition of an intuitive, low-threshold, high-ceiling approach to reprogramming ensemble modules will add extensibility to this already powerful model of complexity. In addition to the primary objective, the design and testing of end-user programming for distributed embedded computing can inform other applications of this technology.

    This SBIR Phase II project addresses a critical national need for more expansive and hands-on STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education by developing a mechatronic and robotics construction kit for teaching and learning engineering design synthesis. The research objective is to develop a teaching tool to interest young learners in engineering design, encourage and engage them in engineering practices specifically, creating appealing technology through exploring STEM topics that meets or exceeds national standards. The goal is to engage young people regardless of prior technical experience or STEM exposure in designing mechatronics and robotics systems, and through this to gain interest, experience, and confidence in engineering design synthesis. The work comprises developing construction kit hardware, a software environment for children to program their mechatronic constructions, and materials for using the kit to teach and learn STEM topics and engineering design. As the hardware advances, the project will develop software and learning resources that scaffold the construction kit with educational materials. It aims to support teachers and other educators incorporating the mechatronics kit into classroom and out-of-school learning, addressing national STEM standards while advancing research on how children learn complex design concepts and how educators can best support this progression.

    The broader/commercial impact of this SBIR Phase II project is in engendering in young learners innovation, design, and creative problem solving among the most important skills for tomorrow's workforce. These skills are addressed within STEM disciplines, however, too often the use of technology in education is limited to skill based computer operations, and engineering is neglected altogether. The teaching and learning tool and its ensemble of software and learning resources truly integrates every letter in the STEM acronym, while inviting students who have no background in robotics, engineering, design, technology, or computer programming to begin creating immediately. This leverages their creativity as motivation to continue learning in these fields. Precisely because kit removes the need for advanced fabrication skills or programming knowledge, this kit and its accompanying activities will promote broader inclusion of students who may have traditionally felt intimidated from more complex STEM engagement. As more students succeed with the kit and its ensemble of learning activities, this enhances a future workforce, an informed citizenry, as well as supporting teachers and educators to explore what all students can achieve when given motivating and confidence building STEM activities.

- abstractText: "This SBIR project's innovation is a unique web-based authoring framework
    for creating animated interactive web content that replaces university-level STEM
    (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) textbooks in traditional or online
    courses. The confluence of HTML5, cloud services, and ubiquitous portable devices
    enables widespread use of web-native content having engaging effective activities
    for students including animations, interactive simulators including mini-games,
    and self-assessments. Such content is difficult to develop/maintain in traditional
    publishing paradigms involving a small author/editor core team. A wiki-style crowdsourced
    approach, with oversight by an author/editor core team, is more scalable but web-based
    authoring tools support only limited content types like text or drawings. The
    project's intellectual merit lies in developing a novel web-based authoring tool
    for creating HTML5 code for animations, including a novel automated synthesis
    of the code from abstract restricted-form English-sentence specifications inspired
    by experiences in developing state-of-the-art automated circuit synthesis techniques.
    The merit also lies in a new repository of parameterized interactive simulations
    with potentially wide applicability in STEM fields. Results will include the initial
    tool and repository, plus use by instructors and graduate students from several
    universities to demonstrate crowdsourcing feasibility.  \n\nThe broader/commercial
    impact of this project includes catalyzing a new partnering approach between a
    publisher and universities, striking a new balance between core-team authored
    content and crowdsourcing. A core author/editor team creates initial content and
    outlines needs, requiring less upfront investment, and the community adopts the
    content and contributes items under the core team's curation. Curated crowdsourced
    content can dramatically improve content and reduce creation/maintenance costs.
    The approach can expand to curated crowdsourced homeworks, automated grading,
    online help tools, quizzing services, student performance analysis, and more,
    unleashing synergy among universities to build common tools that benefit the community,
    a necessity made manifest due to drastic reductions in university budgets. The
    project's initial focus on computer science lower-division topics may yield company
    revenues of $5M in textbooks within a few years and $10M considering expanded
    services shifted from university to company, for CS alone, and $40M-$50M for multiple
    STEM disciplines. The addressable market for lower division STEM is $1B textbooks
    and $2B expanded services. The project's approach provides a practical strategy,
    with individual instructors initially adopting the content as a textbook replacement
    for campus-based or online classes, followed by possible expanded service arrangements
    made with departments/universities."

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase 1 project proposes to demonstrate the feasibility
    of an advanced personalized learning system for pre-collegiate and remedial Algebra,
    with future extension to other scientific and mathematical disciplines.  The project
    aims to model learning as a complex dynamics system, and to develop a user-model
    that incorporates student profile data with a detailed and large set of markers
    on usage and performance collected from an analytics engine.  These markers can
    be derived from a student's learning and social activities, such as her interaction
    with various types of learning resources, participation on question and answer
    forums and so on. This model then guides a recommender system to select appropriate
    resources from a learning catalog based on the student's unique learning path.
    \  Whereas, the project uses open source recommender algorithms, the intellectual
    merit lies in developing a user model, identifying the specific markers that impact
    learning, automatically reconfiguring the learning material, and in demonstrating
    its viability for algebra learners.  This model will be built leveraging some
    of the latest infrastructures in education technology including an authoring and
    delivery framework, a learning catalog of 10 million curated learning resources,
    and the latest advances in data-analytics and information filtering systems. \n\nThe
    broader/commercial impact lies in using the proposed technology to replace textbooks
    and other less-advanced learning systems, not only in mathematics, but also in
    other STEM disciplines, making it easier, faster and more affordable for students
    to learn. To an extent, it will level the playing field by providing equal access
    to a personalized 1-on-1 type of experience, even for those students who don't
    have the opportunity to get high quality instruction and mentorship today. It
    will significantly impact students who today struggle with mathematics and STEM
    subjects, by providing alternate and more relevant ways for them to visualize
    and learn.  Additionally, Zyante's technology and expanded services will enable
    colleges/universities to offer high-quality online courses and successfully handle
    larger enrollments.  All this will ultimately improve national outcomes and provide
    a better-trained workforce in disciplines needed to drive the economic success
    of the US.   For these reasons, it is important that the proposed technology be
    readily commercialized."

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase II project develops novel adaptive techniques for
    web-based learning materials, and creates Algebra and Statistics content using
    those techniques. College textbooks and homework are being replaced with web-based
    learning materials that are highly-interactive, involving animations, learning
    questions, and auto-generated auto-graded homework/quiz exercises. The project
    develops those exercises to adjust (adapt) to the learner's performance as well
    as to the learner's preferences, providing a novel structured form of adaptivity
    that maximizes learning efficiency while reducing student anxiety, in contrast
    to many other proposed adaptive techniques. The project creates new content for
    the topics of Algebra and for Statistics, two critical subjects with which many
    college students struggle. The result will be greater success (and less failure)
    in Algebra and Statistics courses by young college students, leading to more graduates
    in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) fields, which contribute
    greatly to the nation's productivity and competitiveness. The techniques can be
    applied to many other STEM and non-STEM subjects, and for learning beyond college
    courses too.  \n\nThis SBIR Phase II project develops novel adaptive techniques
    for web-based learning materials, called structured student-guided adaptive (SSGA)
    techniques. In contrast to some recent adaptive commercial products, SSGA preserves
    the ability of an instructor to maintain a structured path through the material,
    which is critical for keeping students in synch with lecture/discussion sessions,
    for enabling students to study with classmates, and more. Adaptivity comes in
    several forms, including auto-generating successively-harder problems based on
    correct completion of earlier problems, with explanations and source material
    carefully integrated to ensure students learn underlying concepts. Also, the adaptivity
    is in part guided by the student, who can choose to start with simpler or harder
    problems, or can auto-generate self-quizzes based on performance, selected material,
    and more. In contrast with other products, student-guided adaptivity gives students
    appropriate control over their learning, yielding a sense of empowerment and reducing
    anxiety that can inhibit learning. The project builds the authoring platform necessary
    to support SSGA material creation, building upon a previously-developed authoring
    framework for interactive web material. The project also creates new material
    for college algebra and statistics courses, whose high attrition rates can be
    reduced by replacing traditional textbooks/homework with SSGA material."

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase II project develops a new web-based publishing paradigm
    that creates interactive learning content for university-level science, technology,
    engineering, and math (STEM) fields. The interactive content, featuring animations,
    interactive question sets, and online tools, along with some text, may replace
    or enhance traditional textbooks, with studies showing significant improvements
    in student engagement and learning outcomes. The project addresses the nationwide
    high dropout rates of STEM students, due in part to outmoded learning materials.
    Such dropout rates not only prevent students from achieving their career goals,
    but result in a shortage of college graduates in nationally-critical STEM fields.
    The project creates novel web-based tools that empower teachers, and even students,
    to straightforwardly contribute new interactive content, thus tapping the latent
    talent and energy of many thousands of people. The project creates automated and
    human-overseen processes that efficiently and effectively percolate the highest-quality
    contributions to the top of lists, enabling content to be created and maintained
    at large scale and low cost. The project's new publishing paradigm can disrupt
    the existing publishing industry. The interactive quality content can increase
    the number of students who successfully graduate in STEM fields, which can strengthen
    the nation's economy and competitiveness. \n\nThe project develops a new web-based
    content authoring and delivery framework that supports a novel curated-crowdsourced
    publishing paradigm. The framework tightly integrates collaborative web-based
    authoring with delivery of animated interactive web-based content. The project
    develops elegant tools for instructors, and even students, to contribute new interactive
    items. Such tools include a novel browser-based animation creation tool, which
    allows powerful animations to be easily and quickly created via any web browser
    without requiring application installation or requiring extensive tool training.
    The project creates and tests new processes that, via a combination of peer evaluations,
    usage data, and assessments, automatically percolate quality contributions to
    the top, for final curation by instructors, authors, or editors. Such percolation
    crowdsourcing can yield superior learning materials, at scale and cost-effectively,
    while simultaneously yielding substantially lower prices than traditional textbooks."

- abstractText: "This Phase II project aims to develop software to automatically assess
    public speaking skills and prepare students with better oral communications skills
    necessary to perform job tasks. Oral expression is the most highly valued ability
    throughout the economy and ranks as the second most highly-valued skill for high-wage,
    high-growth, high-skill occupations. Approximately 4.5 million college students
    take a basic communications course each year, however, as class sizes get larger
    and online learning becomes more common, public speaking instruction becomes increasingly
    difficult.  Practice and feedback are essential aspects of these courses, yet
    it is a struggle for teachers to find enough time to sufficiently interact with
    students. This SBIR project aims to develop the key concepts of automated public
    speaking assessment such that a student?s vocal delivery can be objectively measured
    and presented in a manner that creates an independent, personalized learning experience.
    Unlike traditional methods of public speaking assessment, the proposed system
    can be available at any time, provide objective feedback and track student practice
    and improvement. The proposed Software-as-a-Service is projected to generate $16
    Million in revenue over five years and create more than 25 high-paying, US-based
    jobs. \n\n\nThis Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes
    to develop an automated assessment system for public speaking that determines
    how a speaker would be perceived by an audience.  Automated assessment for speech
    has already occurred in spoken language proficiency, which leverages Automated
    Speech Recognition (ASR) and semantic analysis. Automated voice assessment has
    also been utilized in lie detection and emotion detection, which focus on autonomic
    responses in the user?s voice, such as when stress affects the vocal cords. The
    hypothesis behind this SBIR project is that speakers can consciously use and modify
    non-semantic speech behaviors to produce more desirable listener perceptions.
    Automatically linking listener perception to speech behaviors represents a novel
    direction in automated assessment for speech. The Phase II objective is to develop
    software sufficient for automated public speaking assessment such that a student?s
    vocal delivery can be objectively measured and presented in a manner that creates
    an independent, personalized learning experience. Voice analytics capability investigated
    in Phase I will be enhanced and developed into a cloud-based service which helps
    students practice, track, and improve their public speaking habits."

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a developmentally appropriate robotic construction kit specifically designed for early childhood education (PreK-2) for teaching the components of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics), especially the "T" of technology and the "E" of engineering, which have been the most neglected for this age segment. Recent research on educational robotics has not focused on the foundational years. However, both from an economic and a developmental standpoint, educational interventions that begin in early childhood are associated with lower costs and more durable effects. The proposed work is consistent with the increasing Federal efforts to focus on early childhood education. It is organized around several technical and business questions: 1. What design principles inform creation of a developmentally appropriate robotic kit to be manufactured at low-cost?  2. What are the most feasible technical mechanisms for the robotic kit to be programmed by young children through the use of tangible blocks without a computer screen?  3. What manufacturing processes are needed for scaling from single prototypes to large-scale volume? 4. What are the outcomes of user testing with children, teachers and parents in school and home settings?  5. What is a sustainable commercialization plan?

    The broader/commercial impact of this proposal is that it will contribute to the emerging field of robotics in education by addressing the needs of an educational segment, early childhood, that today lacks the necessary tools for teaching technology and engineering in a developmentally appropriate way. This work comes at a time of re-envisioning early childhood education at the Federal level, and an accepted need to develop innovative new technologies and approaches for STEM. This interdisciplinary proposal makes contributions to the fields of learning technologies, computer science education, early childhood education and human-computer interaction. At the same time it provides an opportunity to address the needs of a target audience that, according to the latest US Census, consists of approximately 13.3 million children. Given the size of the industry devoted to early childhood education, the potential commercial impact is significant.

- abstractText: |-
    This SBIR Phase II project focuses on robot systems designed for early childhood education (preK-2). There is increasing research and applications for educational robotics, but little attention are focused on the foundational years. The early childhood segment is underserved because there are few available platforms for STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) education that are developmentally appropriate for children 4-7 years old. However, research shows that from an economic and a developmental standpoint, educational programs that begin in early childhood result in lower costs and more durable effects than those that begin later on. This project focuses on developmentally appropriate robot kits for young children, and the curriculum support, teacher resources and automated assessment tools to make this innovation useful for early childhood education in a broadly disseminated, sustainable and scalable way. Recent re-envisioning of early childhood programs by the Federal government has resulted in calls to develop innovative technologies and approaches for teaching STEM. Given the size of the industry devoted to early childhood education, the potential commercial impact is significant, opening new markets and job opportunities.  This innovation also has the potential to have significant positive impact on the US economy by preparing children with economically important skills.


    The innovation underlying this project is the design of a robot system that engages 4 to 7 year old children in learning programming concepts through the use of a developmentally appropriate programming language. In order to be developmentally appropriate for this age range, the programming language is physical, not typed, with no screens or keyboards of any kind required. The resulting educational platform also enables children to develop engineering design process skills by building physical objects that can respond to different inputs through the use of sensors. This project is organized around five technical objectives: a developmentally appropriate robot kit for young children to learn programming and engineering; robot modules for curriculum integration with other areas such as math, science, literacy and the arts; support systems for early childhood teachers through a web portal with resources for both formal and informal education and professional development strategies; and an automated learning assessment system that collects data characterizing student learning directly from the robot, analyzes it through innovative mechanisms and displays it using visualization tools according to the different needs of parents, educators and school leadership to understand learning outcomes; and cost reduction of the robot system for broadening adoption.

    This SBIR Phase 1 project will create an engaging online learning game using venomous marine snails as a conduit to explore scientific issues in nature through creative problem solving. The USA is currently ranked 52nd in the world in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. This is detrimental intellectually and economically to the future of American society. Recent studies have indicated it is not what we teach, but how we teach that enhances student-learning abilities, particularly as it pertains to STEM. A strong case is being made for using learning games to convey educational content. This project is driven by the research objectives to understand how children learn specific science content and why certain game elements are better suited to convey scientific material. The outcome of this project will be a propriety digital learning game including a unique parent/player assessment tool used to measure novel STEM content during game playing and extending opportunities for learners to engage in ongoing scientific research ("citizen science"). Commercialization of the products created in this project will transform scientific discoveries in predatory marine snail research for social and economic benefit to meet the NSF's mission of supporting education initiatives that improve the lives of U.S. Citizens, and generate income for tax revenue and jobs via the employment of software designers, educators and scientists.

    This project will build proprietary assessment tools into online games that continuously engage users in the scientific process of discovery and application of science learning using a novel player/parent data aggregator dashboard. Our inventive two-sided player/parent dashboard will allow players to measure their progress and attain unique, educational rewards such as unlocking new game components, and identifying local citizen science projects to enhance their STEM learning. The goal of this project is to disrupt the status quo of STEM learning and address STEM learning market needs by combining gameplay, content learning, and assessment tools to develop high-quality, creative, science learning games. A three-component Play-Break-Fix strategy will be used to design and develop all games: 1. Iterative prototyping to generate novel ideas and integrate any existing content. 2. Repetitive evaluation to test the usability of demos and the initial feasibility of the learning games created and parent/player dashboard concept. 3. Commercialization testing of the products from this project that are the best of the build and analyze model. The parent/player assessment dashboard developed in this project will provide a template for furthering parental engagement with children's learning to significantly improve STEM knowledge and will engage players in citizen science experiences that will strengthen their connection to STEM learning.

    This SBIR Phase II project will develop an easy to use real-time formative assessment tool for educators that will be uniquely aligned to each student and deployed via a virtual reality learning game that uses venomous marine snails as a conduit for exploring scientific issues in nature. The USA is currently ranked 52nd in the world in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. This is detrimental intellectually and economically to the future of American society. Recent studies indicate it is not what is taught, but how it is taught that enhances student-learning abilities, particularly as it pertains to STEM. As a result, this project is driven by the research objectives to understand how children learn specific science content and why certain game elements are better suited to convey scientific material. The outcome of this project is a proprietary multi-tiered formative assessment tool that can measure real time student learning of novel STEM content obtained through a virtual reality learning game experience. This project will enable teachers to nimbly tailor future instruction with individualized student learning goals.  Commercialization of the products created in this project will transform scientific learning and measurable engagement in educational games for social and economic benefit to meet the NSF?s mission of supporting education initiatives that improve the lives of U.S. Citizens, and generate income for tax revenue and jobs via the employment of software designers, educators and scientists.

    The proprietary technology developed in this SBIR Phase II will be a first-of-its-kind assessment dashboard that will link virtual reality and web-based learning environments with formative assessment to fuel instruction and deepen learning. This project will build proprietary assessment tools into online and virtual reality games which continuously engage users in the process of scientific inquiry and discovery using novel formative assessments customized to each player. The proprietary assessment dashboard allows teachers and players to measure their progress in real-time and identify opportunities to enhance their STEM learning. Using Unity as the platform, player actions and decisions will be met with tailored formative assessments and ongoing feedback throughout game play. This feedback helps teachers delineate where their students are along their learning progressions and fuels further instruction. The novel approach of this assessment dashboard transforms qualitative and quantitative learning and has the potential to significantly enhance student engagement and commitment to scientific inquiry to support emerging science changemakers. The research objective of the player/teacher dashboard is to align feedback on student learning during game play with dynamic quantitative and qualitative formative assessment that create a seamless demonstration of knowledge acquisition while providing teachers with multiple opportunities to engage learners in deeper and more meaningful levels of inquiry before, during, and after gameplay. The products generated from this project are aligned to the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and the International Baccalaureate (IB) program to ensure the content is of the highest caliber and distribution is to a large global customer base. The anticipated results from exposing teachers and students to this project will be increased competencies in STEM, which will transform players into lifelong learners and enhance engagement in STEM fields and careers.

- abstractText: "This SBIR phase I project offers a unique approach to teaching the
    difficult content of operating with fractions through estimation. Extensive cognitive
    science research shows the importance of estimating on children's sense-making,
    especially within the often counter-intuitive topic of fractions operations. Research
    also shows that estimating fractional numbers is highly predictive of future success
    in mathematics, and early intervention in this area improves long-term outcomes.
    This project aims to improve children's understanding of arithmetic by focusing
    on estimation. Unlike other apps, which typically end with just a score, this
    project will provide rich, actionable insight to help teachers screen and monitor
    students' progress over time, thereby improving teachers' instruction as well
    as student learning. Closely aligning with NSF?s mission of improving mathematics
    education for all children, this project fills an essential need in the marketplace
    for research-based, engaging software that correlates highly with long-term academic
    outcomes. This software will be designed especially for children with special
    needs and will meet the criteria for RTI screening and interventions, further
    increasing its commercial value for the school market and its potential to generate
    income. \n\nThis proposal seeks to develop a prototype of a game focused on the
    addition and subtraction of fractions through estimation, which will encourage
    sense-making and bolster conceptual understanding. The app will also provide data
    reporting to teachers to help them tailor instruction and target interventions.
    Extracting actionable insight from children's gameplay rather than from standardized
    assessments, is a novel innovation that has the potential to dramatically change
    how kids learn. The development process will include wire-framing the gameplay
    and developing app components and features. The initial data architecture will
    involve a concept map of student learning behaviors mapped onto teacher actions
    for classroom intervention. The corresponding data structure will collect and
    store data during Phase I in preparation for further analysis and reporting during
    Phase II. The project will involve front-end component testing and follow an iterative
    design process, observing student interactions with the software, making revisions
    and debugging where appropriate. This project's research will include both informal
    design research and components testing as well as a small learning study, a close
    observation of 15-20 students with mathematics learning difficulties, exploring
    the effects of using the fractions software on 5th graders' procedural and conceptual
    knowledge of adding fractions."

  title: 'SBIR Phase I:  Mobile Games Teaching Rational Number Operations Through
    Estimation'
- abstractText: |-
    This SBIR Phase II project offers a unique approach to teaching the difficult content of operating with fractions through interactive, adaptive games. Existing products are not effective at teaching fractions, and half of US eighth graders cannot correctly order three fractions, a fourth grade standard. Current research and the Common Core State Standards emphasize using a number line to teach fractions, which is a more effective approach; however, leading curricula are not fully aligned to this method. This project aims to improve 3rd-5th grade students' understanding of fractions through engaging apps that encourage estimation and problem-solving. Unlike other apps, which typically end with just a score, this project will provide rich, actionable insight to help teachers screen and monitor students' progress over time, thereby improving teachers' instruction as well as student learning. Closely aligning with NSF's mission of improving mathematics education for all children, this project fills an essential need in the marketplace for engaging, effective software that aligns with Common Core and provides data-driven intervention support. This software will be specially designed for children who struggle in mathematics and will meet the criteria for intervention software, further increasing its commercial value for the school market and its potential to generate income.

    This project aims to improve children's use of efficient strategies in estimating and solving fractions arithmetic by targeting children?s metastrategic awareness and metacognitive abilities. This project will include the development of a series of fractions apps and game-based data reporting for teachers to help them tailor instruction and target interventions. Extracting actionable insight from children?s gameplay rather than from standardized tests is a novel innovation that has the potential to dramatically change teaching and learning. The development process will include wireframing novel gameplay and developing app components and features. The backend system will identify learning patterns within clickstream data collected during play and apply data-mining techniques to these patterns. Instead of assessing single actions as correct or incorrect, the backend will identify series of actions and associate them with a particular strategy. This data will be used to inform instructors, test hypotheses, and provide evidence for learning. A dynamic content generation engine will use the insights extracted from student data to provide learners with highly targeted, fine-tuned activities. The project?s research will include both informal design research and a randomized control study with 3rd-5th grade students to determine the effects of using the software on procedural and conceptual knowledge of fractions.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to construct the first in a series of science collaborative multiplatform learning games called Martha Madison?s Marvelous Machines.  This game will be designed to engage a target audience of middle school girls in virtual collaborative physics projects to improve understanding of the nature of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines and careers. The specific content of this game will enable students to develop understanding of introductory Physics and Engineering aligned with Common Core standards. There will be options for single player play and multi-player play, depending on the platform(s) on which the game is released. In the multi-player option, there will be puzzles which can only be solved through collaboration with other users (via network play). Second Avenue Software (SAS) anticipates the release of Common Core Standards for Science and Martha Madison will be developed according to the Common Core Standards in order to provide a consistent, clear understanding of what students are expected to learn. In the event that Common Core Standards for Science are not in draft form at the time of the award, SAS will draw on its extensive experience correlating with state standards to make a physics and engineering game that is engaging, educative and robust.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project lies in SAS?s contribution to meeting the need of improving physics and engineering education by providing a game-based application which as the potential to increase interest in STEM careers and learning outcomes in STEM disciplines. Based on a review of the literature regarding womens? participation in STEM education, STEM careers and learning modalities for women and girls, this requires development of materials specifically designed to meet their educational needs and interests.  Current practice in commercial games reflects this need.  Games are frequently designed in two versions: one for boys and one for girls, reflecting each gender?s distinct patterns of play. Martha Madison will be designed to appeal to all genders without alienating boys or girls, while paying special attention to engaging girls in STEM learning. Martha Madison will be created using the Unity 3D platform which allows for publishing to a diverse array of applications including tablets, computers, consoles (all of which now include digital delivery), and mobile devices. With so many possible applications, Martha Madison has tremendous commercial potential.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to determine the feasibility of new software implementations of formative assessment (FA) techniques for mathematics instruction. Tablet devices such as the iPad have an enormous potential to facilitate revolutionary change in education, but such potential is heavily dependent on the availability of appropriate software and services. The proposed activities will research the extent to which classroom FA techniques can be applied or enhanced when the teacher's role is augmented by a platform for computer aided instruction. They will seek to create adaptive learning environments that go beyond current state-of-the-art systems and that apply the adaptivity to free-form content delivered as instructional video segments and highly interactive problems, and to do so while maintaining a flow of content that feels natural. The proposed activities also have the potential to provide new tools for the analysis of effective techniques in mathematics education and interventions. The ability to model student understanding and analyze the learning process will lead to the creation of new learning analytics tools and enable additional research into effective practices for the teaching and learning of mathematics.

    The potential broader impacts of the proposed activities include improved student access to mathematics; the increased participation of underrepresented groups in Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM); and improved STEM education through informed teacher practice and educator development. The proposed activities directly address mathematics education at a critical point in the curriculum: pre-algebra readiness, as set against the widely differing levels of mathematical fluency that emerge out of the elementary grades. Without a solid facility with pre-algebra mathematics, many subjects that are essential to participation in the modern world become difficult or impossible to master and academic confidence and commitment erode. More than any other subject, mathematical learning is cumulative, and as students fall behind their classmates, new material becomes less and less comprehensible and through this feedback they face an ever-widening gap to their peers. Formative assessment practices have been well-established as effective in closing these gaps and informing teacher decision making. It is by establishing toolkits with novel, software-based, formative assessment and helping to drive educator adoption of new formative assessment techniques that the proposed research may deliver these broader impacts. By addressing key customer needs, the project will create significant new commercial value within the educational market.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project from Workplace Technologies Research Inc. (WTRI) will explore the basic principles of learning revealed by one of the firm's more highly successful technology implementations in which user knowledge and performance with the system were found to be critical.  The data involved were collected on 3500 shopfloor personnel who were given an activity-based training exercise on a complex computer technology.  WTRI's training was based on research showing that experienced adults learn complex concepts in the context of solving problems at work.  The trainees' acceptance and rapid development as 'expert' users suggest that a particular set of principles used to design the training may be a key element in learning complex technologies.  Further,  the later high performance of highly 'resistant' workers may indicate an important role of resistance in innovation.  The project seeks to identify the important mechanisms of learning and to find ways to broaden their application.  In particular, the project seeks to provide the foundation for designing methods of accelerating learning that can be part of the context of the actual work activity and that will not require the considerable expense and lost productivity incurred with off-line training.  At the same time, the model also has significant potential for enhancing our understanding of 'construction/deconstruction' and the role of resistance in accelerated learning.

    WRTI has conceived of a model, Iterative Technology Implementation Model (ITIM(TM)), to increase technology deployment success rates as measured by time to adoption by the workers and long term retention. The model has great potential for generalizing the facilitation of the process of technology adoption/ replacement, if the principles that have made the approach to training for change and technology adoption so successful can be distilled from the large, rich data set at hand.  This distillation can in turn facilitate appropriate training selection and design and faster implementation of change, thus making needed assistance more affordable to a broader spectrum of companies.

    the development of an assessment tool that will enable users to profile a decision-maker's
    cognitive agility and expertise in high-level business situations.  It is appropriate
    for evaluating decision makers in organizations and for evaluating students.  It
    is based on results from WTRI's recent basic research that has uncovered mechanisms
    that may be involved in the determination of business expertise.  It uses knowledge
    elicitation technology that WTRI has developed over several years to support research
    on the identification of intuitive expertise (in the sense of Dreyfus, 1997).
    \ The project outlines a plan to develop an on-line internet based version that
    is self-scoring and has been tested among well-known experts. The product will
    also be field-tested for its ability to predict general vs. industry specific
    expertise.  The expected outcome is an easy to administer technology that can
    used by professional evaluators, professors, students or individuals and will
    assist in staff development and education.  The profiles of expertise generated
    by the product will identify hidden strengths, areas of weakness, and suggestions
    for further development.  A long-term goal is to create versions that can be distributed
    by qualified resellers and universities. \n\nIn the current climate of rapid workplace
    change, decision-makers need to continually evaluate their ability to adapt to
    changes and re-invent their organization's value and competitive future.  Few
    assessment tools address the cognitive underpinnings involved in the skill set
    involved.  Rather, they evaluate personal traits or sub-skills that have some
    correlation with leadership, broadly defined.  Using an empirically verified model
    of expertise in business strategy development and performance prediction, WTRI
    has built an assessment tool that locates an individual against this model, much
    like chess players are evaluated against a notion of a Chess Grand Master.  When
    applied to individual client situations, this tool has shown itself to have powerful
    predictive capability and has successfully informed staff development efforts.
    \ Its distinctive feature is assessment of the ability to analyze disparate sources
    of information in order to make strategy level decisions and supporting tactical
    plans.  Making it more widely available and usable by non-scientists would greater
    contribute to efforts to increase the performance of both organizations and decision
    makers.  Organizations, distributors and several institutions of higher learning
    have expressed interest in this project to address what they consider to be an
    unmet need area."

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes a dynamic modeling technology that helps manufacturers visualize the top and bottom line financial impact of changes made at the strategic, tactical and operational levels of a business.  WTRI has a long history of research and applications that work with the way that people become intuitive experts, the ways that experts use technologies and the cognitive triggers underlying shifts in cognitive frameworks and capabilities.  One of the intellectual merits of the proposed research is that it will further add to knowledge on how technologies extend complex cognitive capabilities in manufacturing settings.  This tool promises to address two well-known problems limiting manufacturing competitiveness: decision making rigidity (e.g., recipe driven solutions) and the inability to think simultaneously on strategic and tactical levels.  Currently, complex and difficult to use versions of these models exist and have proven successful when used by WTRI principals and maintained by the firm's technicians. The research will explore the core features of the technology that have made it successful.  It will result in the development of cost effective versions that can be easily used by customers and which can be modified to their business issues without extensive re-programming.

    The broader impacts of the technology have already been indicated by increased use of these models in client engagements with measurable success.  However, in their current form, the models are not easily used independently; that is, without the participation of WTRI, although demand for them is high.   Historically, the difficulty of anticipating the links between changes in execution and a financial impact at the bottom or top line has accounted for many change initiative failures.  These models enable manufacturers to examine hypotheses about the impact on strategic goals of changes in their organizations.  University programs also see that the tool may have pedagogic value in showing professionals how to think through the multi-level issues in manufacturing companies.  The models themselves may also add to our understanding of how the different levels and functions in an organization interact.  Often, specific between-level or between-function impacts are known, but the model promises to bring all the interactions together into one dynamic whole, exposing both hidden negative ripple effects and growth opportunities that would not be discovered otherwise.  Finally, this tool can be viewed as providing a way to make our value vdded resellers more effective with their clients and their businesses more successful.

A methodology and service,  ATTAIN(TM), has been conceived to accelerate the integration of technology by rapidly and aggressively identifying critical processes and practices in the organization and shifting them in value-added ways at the level of worker cognition and operational specifics.  This method has been shown to be highly successful, but is labor intensive, expensive, and requires highly skilled practitioners.  Furthermore, the method upon which ATTAIN is based is not sufficiently targeted.  That is, more often than not, businesses have only 3-4 workplace processes or practices that need to be changed in order to increase the company's competitiveness.  The original method does not single these out as more important than other elements of the workplace.  To date,  increasing the effective incorporation of new technology by changing workplace practice and worker cognition through specialized simulation training, but not at identifying the most appropriate target for the technology implementation or change has been very successful.  The work of Phase II will involve integrating the current methods with those of another company.  Their method has been shown to identify the "vital few" practices that mitigate a company's overall competitive survival and which are the most appropriate targets for change.  Phase II has two goals.  First, a hybrid method that is quicker and more targeted will be developed.  Second, a practitioner training approach and supporting materials that make it possible for professionals without extensive experience to deliver the method in a high quality manner will be developed.

    Training and licensing practitioners in a hybrid method of workplace learning will contribute significantly to the problem of efficient and successful technology integration and implementation of new technologies.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on the development of an assessment tool that will enable users to profile a decision-maker's cognitive agility and expertise in high-level business situations. It is appropriate for evaluating decision makers in organizations and students who aspire to leadership roles.  This version of the product can also be self-administered.  It is based on results from recent basic research conducted by Workplace Technologies Research Inc. (WTRI) that revealed the cognitive mechanisms involved in the thinking of highly accomplished experts in business.  It uses knowledge elicitation technology that WTRI has developed over several years to support research on the identification of intuitive expertise (in the sense of Dreyfus 1997). The proposal outlines a plan to develop an on-line Internet based version that is self-scoring and tested among well-known experts.  The product will be field-tested for its ability to predict general vs. industry specific expertise.  The expected outcome is an easy to use tool for professional evaluators, professors, students or individuals, which will assist in staff development and education.  The profiles generated by the product will identify hidden strengths, areas of weakness, and suggestions for further development.  The long-term goal is distribution by recruiters, coaches, universities and consultancies.

    In the current climate of rapid workplace change, decision-makers need to continually evaluate their ability to adapt to changes and re-invent their organization's value and competitive future.  Few assessment tools address the cognitive underpinnings of the skill set involved.  Rather, they evaluate personal traits or sub-skills that have some correlation with leadership, broadly defined.  Using an empirically verified model of expertise in business strategy development and performance prediction, the research team at WTRI has built an assessment tool that locates an individual with regard to this model; much like chess players are evaluated against a notion of a Chess Grand Master.  When applied to individual client situations, this tool has been shown to have powerful predictive capability and thus has successfully informed staff development efforts.  Its distinctive feature is assessment of the ability to analyze disparate sources information in order to make strategy level decisions and supporting tactical plans.  Making the tool more widely available and usable by non-scientists could importantly contribute to efforts to increase the performance of both organizations and decision makers.  Organizations, distributors and several institutions of higher learning have expressed interest in this technology, which they consider to be addressing an area of unmet need.

    the development of project management expertise by enabling users to rehearse
    tough, real-world challenges in an immersive, Virtual World environment. Studies
    of expert project managers indicate that their skill was acquired over many years
    and as a result of learning by failure. Accelerating this process would have a
    huge impact on the costs of real world failure. Some studies have estimated the
    organizational losses to upwards of $82 billion annually. These losses are thought
    to be largely preventable with better approaches to project management education.
    The broader/commercial impact of project lies in its ability to 1) lower the risk
    of learning through failure, 2) accelerate the time it takes to effectively train
    novices, and 3) alleviate some of the costs associated with unanticipated mistakes
    made in the real world. Using an immersive, simulation-based, outcomes driven
    rehearsal methodology, this product has the potential to 1) increase the success
    rate of projects for those with limited real-world experience, 2) by allowing
    users to rehearse and test deployment plans without risk and 3) by providing participants
    new to project management an opportunity to encounter tough problems and develop
    solutions under pressure. \n\nThis company's rehearsal method enables teams of
    participants to interact with virtual replicas of actual processes and products
    in the context of an ongoing business with complex goals. The primary innovation
    will be the use of Virtual Worlds to provide rich interactive environments to
    accelerate expertise development among novice project managers. The Virtual Worlds
    environments are enriched with embedded behavior and decision monitoring software
    designed to automate the tracking of progress and provide feedback. Early pilots
    with experts indicate that the method may accelerate expertise development by
    as much as two years. The objective for this project is to refine the approach
    for use with novices by targeting key skills of project management that are normally
    learned through years of experience, and specifically, learning from failure.
    Virtual Worlds also provide an ideal platform to test hypotheses regarding the
    technical implementation, individual engagement and team outcomes in a novice
    population. As such, the project will also resolve a number of questions about
    the key features at play within emerging Virtual Worlds platforms."

    This SBIR Phase I project will culminate in an application which teaches beginners to compose their own music. Music is traditionally taught using physical instruments and sheet music, both of which are complex and present imposing financial and practical barriers to creativity. As a result, even though parents value music education highly and research has shown that studying music is beneficial to cognitive and emotional development, the majority of beginning music students drop out during the first year of instruction, before having a chance to express their creativity through music. By using mobile devices as modular teaching tools, the proposed solution will make composition accessible as a first step in learning music. Increasing creativity in beginning music education will decrease the dropout rate for people already studying music, and also make music education accessible for the millions of families nationwide who value music but cannot afford private lessons. By expanding a market for lessons that is already roughly $3 billion per year in the United States, this project has significant revenue and growth potential, in addition to increasing the accessibility and quality of education in the U.S. and worldwide.

    This project uses an intuitive gestural composition interface to make it possible for beginners to compose music visually and hear it played back in real time. By using simplified representative block notation, the proposed software makes composition accessible even to those with no knowledge of music notation and no experience on an instrument. Using a musical system based on music theory and arranging concepts, the complexity of music composition is reduced at the beginning to make a user's first compositions sound good to them, encouraging them to explore further. More complexity is gradually introduced through a scaffolded, project-based curriculum as users learn musical concepts through creative exploration and engaging games. This curriculum includes a gradual step-by-step transition between simplified block notation and full traditional music notation. The curriculum will be developed in two phases: 1) piloting a modular teaching tool that allows music teachers to increase the creativity and individualization of their assignments by incorporating composition into their teaching, and 2) developing an autonomous teaching tool for the consumer market that combines free creation with educational games to teach musical concepts with or without the aid of a teacher.

  title: 'SBIR Phase I:  Music Education Through Composition on Mobile Devices'
- abstractText: |-
    This SBIR Phase I project is dedicated to producing software that makes it easy for people with special needs, especially those on the autism spectrum, to compose their own music. A wide base of evidence shows that music can be a powerful emotional and creative outlet for people with disabilities. Multiple studies show that music can help children on the autism spectrum improve their skills in social interaction, verbal communication,initiating behavior, and social-emotional reciprocity. However, public access to music education has declined dramatically in the United States over the last 40 years. The 6.6 million students in the US with special needs face further barriers to music education because of the significant financial resources and demanding degree of physical dexterity required by instrument lessons. Within this context, private sector innovation is more necessary than ever to increase the accessibility of music education. By offering affordable and intuitive software this project has the potential to make a major impact on the economy by helping to reduce education and health care costs for parents of children with special needs, school special education programs, and adults with disabilities. Just as importantly, democratizing the joy of musical creativity will make a powerful contribution to unlocking the passion, talents, and productivity of people with special needs.


    To make it easy for people with special needs to make their own music, this project will employ gestural composition, responsive design, and data science to produce a software interface that adapts to a users' accessibility preferences based on their previous interactions with the program. A second focus of the project is to produce interactive music lessons focused on self-expression and socio-emotional intelligence. Lessons will utilize and expand upon the creative interface to guide users to write songs that express their mood. Robust user testing and intelligent application of machine learning will be required to ensure that the interface smoothly evolves to enable user creativity. Considerable experimentation will also be required to build lessons which strike a balance between supporting users through linear instruction and empowering users to make expressive decisions and take ownership of their emotions. To mitigate the project's technical risk special needs experts and health professionals will be consulted at every stage of user testing and development. In sum, these innovations address the significant and urgent challenge of opening music up as a medium of creativity, communication and self-expression for people with special needs, especially those on the autism spectrum.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

  title: 'SBIR Phase I: Enabling Musical Creativity for People with Special Needs'
- abstractText: |-
    This project will address the need for accessible, creative music education. Over 90% of Americans believe music education is valuable, but very few people ever learn enough to create their own music. Instrument lessons are a great way for some beginners to learn about music; however, instrument lessons are expensive and difficult, and focus on performance and technique at the expense of creativity. This project uses a simple audiovisual composition interface to empower music learners to create their own original music on mobile devices from the very beginning of their music education. By combining this intuitive composition interface with data tracking and analysis, this project creates the opportunity to provide music makers with personalized, adaptive feedback as they compose. Currently, $3 billion are spent each year in the United States on instrument lessons, even though they are unaffordable for many potential customers. By leveraging the proliferation of mobile devices worldwide, this project will deliver an accessible, low-cost digital music education option, creating a new market that includes customers who are currently priced out. Expanding participation in creative music education will increase the quantity and quality of music composed worldwide, while also building a sustainable, revenue-generating business and creating new jobs.

    Through data-driven agile software development, this project will address the need for accessible music education through the creation of a technology platform that delivers adaptive learning to musical beginners. Because the platform upon which this project is built is already empowering the creation of thousands of songs each week and collecting usage data from live users, this project is uniquely positioned to tackle the complex problem of providing algorithmic feedback on creative work at scale. Research and development will proceed in four stages: (1) expanding internal tools to allow for direct analysis of the thousands of songs being created on the platform each week; (2) developing an algorithmic approach to analyzing songs and reporting the results to users; (3) applying analysis to match users with relevant communities and collaborators; and (4) implementing adaptive learning approaches to help users more effectively learn to create music. This staged development process will result in an innovative and highly differentiated technology that enables beginners with no musical experience to compose their own music, and uses data to actively support their individual needs as they learn.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I innovation addresses deficiencies in science content knowledge exhibited by many elementary school teachers. Project Near-Earth Object is a game-based professional development product that teachers can also use as a self-assessment tool to evaluate their content knowledge in science. It uses interactive science experiments in the form of fast-paced mini-games to increase pre-service and in-service elementary teachers' ability to teach science topics. Research indicates that teacher competence in the content area greatly affects elementary students? interest in and success in science. The innovation relies not only on gaming, but also on a narrative in which players are "recruited" by a league of scientists to help Earth prepare for a pending asteroid collision; they must stop a villain determined to destroy the Earth's anti-asteroid defense. In the interactive science experiments, teachers: use simulations to gather information related to the problem; test hypotheses to solve to science problems; and collaborate using social networking.  The innovation uses computer-adapted differentiated instruction, meaning that each mini-game has six levels of difficulty and the computer adapts difficulty levels according to the learner's performance. Other features include scaffolding of instruction, instant feedback, video tutorials, mobile access, and a backend administrative dashboard for viewing performance data.

    The broader/commercialization impact of Project Near-Earth Object lies in its unique design and large but targeted market niche. There is no direct competition for this product. Project Near-Earth Object is the only intervention on the market that is a science learning game for teachers, available on both Web and mobile platforms, aligned with recognized national standards, featuring a community-based social component, and an easy-to-use dashboard for viewing and tracking performance. There are approximately 3 million teachers and 1200 teacher education programs in the U.S., and demand for elementary teachers is growing. Research indicates that elementary teacher interest and subject matter knowledge in science is low. Teachers recognize that content knowledge is essential for good teaching.  99% of elementary teachers say that performance evaluations should include knowledge of subject matter. This game can be easily integrated into existing teacher training curricula or offered as a stand-alone professional development product. Its scalable online design is conducive to distribution through multiple channels and to competitive pricing structures. Project Near-Earth Object can significantly impact teacher understanding of science content and more importantly how to "do science," which will contribute to better attitudes about science and ultimately to better teachers in the classroom.

    This SBIR Phase II project will enhance the science content knowledge of elementary school pre-service and in-service teachers and increase their effectiveness in teaching science. Studies show significant deficiencies in many elementary teachers? conceptual knowledge of science topics, and this lack of scientific understanding inhibits their ability to teach science effectively. Research also shows that students learn more from teachers with strong comprehension of the subject matter being taught than from teachers with weak content understanding. Using research from cognitive psychology, game-based learning, and multimedia learning theory, this project creates problem-based scenarios and built-in assessments that challenge teachers to solve problems and ensures that they grasp scientific principles. By improving teachers? understanding of science, this project will therefore improve student performance and give students the foundational knowledge needed to pursue careers not only in science, but also in engineering and technology. Increasing the number of young people entering scientific and technical fields has an impact not only on the individuals entering these professional careers, but also on the nation?s productivity, competitiveness, and tax base since science and technology are key drivers of innovation and growth in the U.S. economy.

    The product is a Web-based learning system consisting of a suite of inquiry-based activities designed to (a) strengthen the science knowledge of pre-service and in-service elementary teachers and (b) increase their confidence in and enthusiasm for teaching science. To motivate the learner, the product includes an overarching science fiction narrative with engaging 3D art as well as game-based science learning activities. All science content aligns with The Next Generation Science Standards as well as curriculum focal points and provides learners with immediate and easily accessible data on their science understanding, both procedural and conceptual. Because learners become engaged by the narrative and interactive science experiments, they are less focused on the intervention as a teaching instrument and on their deficiencies in scientific understanding. During engagement, learners are carefully scaffolded through 6 levels of difficulty, and move up and down the levels seamlessly based on performance. Also, learners collect rewards along the way to further motivate them to engage.

  title: 'SBIR Phase II:  An Online Professional Development Science Game for Pre-Service
    and In- Service Teachers'
- abstractText: |-
    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is an online, game-based program to improve the leadership skills of individuals in science, education, the military, government, and industry. Leadership skills are key to innovation, efficiency, and effectiveness in all organizations. The program being developed is built on a proven leadership model and converts that traditional model into a role-playing game. The empirically tested model consists of three basic strategies and six practices that expand leaders' perspectives and enhance their problem-solving skills. The program uses a futuristic narrative, 3D-animated multimedia, and challenging leadership dilemmas to engage learners, who play the role of a novice world leader. The program provides instruction in leadership, and then learners apply their new leadership skills to build an alliance among warring factions and collectively solve a global problem. A series of game quests test learners' understanding, and they receive immediate feedback on all decisions and actions. Learners communicate through social media tools with other players and, at the end, participate in a virtual synchronous debriefing exercise with peers and trained facilitators to ensure full comprehension. An administrative dashboard provides real-time performance data. The game is scalable, accessible, and designed for repeat playability.

    The most profound innovation of this project is that it conceptualizes, designs, and develops a system of game mechanics and algorithms that mimic the facilitator-led human aspect of a research-based, face-to-face model of leadership training. This design entails building out a backend system as an artificial intelligence tool designed to guide users engaging with instructional materials, anticipate player actions, make recommendations on actions and anticipated actions, and provide feedback similar to guidance an on-site facilitator would provide. Furthermore, the game logic supports multiple paths to success, with some paths being more efficient, optimal, elegant, or otherwise more appropriate choices. The game logic and technical design are built to reflect problem solving and leadership in the real world, which is largely based on open-ended decision making. The game mechanics and related backend technology are designed to support open-ended decision-making, thus making game play both more engaging and authentic for players. A final innovation is the linking of an asynchronous online video game learning experience with virtual facilitator-led synchronous debriefing, which can be done on a worldwide scale.  The program will be tested as a global collaboration exercise with both high school students and corporate leaders.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes the *mobile platform that offers a radically new alternative to enterprises for application mobilization. The platform enables mobilization without requiring any software development, mobilizes applications instantaneously, offers a uni&#64257;ed mobilization platform for all of an enterprise?s applications, and enables feature parity controllable by the enterprise. Offered as a cloud-based service, enterprises can non-intrusively adopt &#8727;mobile to rapidly mobilize applications. At the heart of the &#8727;mobile platform is an innovative mobile remote computing protocol (MRCP). &#8727;mobile achieves instantaneous mobilization by allowing the desktop version of the application to be run on a cloud backend, and then using MRCP for intelligently and dynamically interfacing the desktop version with a custom viewer on the mobile device. MRCP performs dynamic transformations both in the downstream - where the transformation is applied to the view presented to the user, and in the upstream - where the transformation is applied to the user actions that need to be delivered back to the application. The transformations are performed in an application agnostic fashion.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will benefit the 85% of enterprise knowledge workers who are expected to have smartphones within the next few years (source: J. Gold Assoc., 2011). A recent survey of CIOs revealed that there are multiple drivers for application mobilization - the key ones being increased productivity of employees, higher revenue, and reduced paper work. Not surprisingly, over 90% of IT managers in a recent survey indicated plans for application mobilization (source: Sybase Survey, 2011). Typical customers for &#8727;mobile include any fortune 1000 large enterprise, medium-sized businesses, and small-medium (SMB) businesses that use applications for business processes. While there is a strong and deep need for application mobilization, there exists no universal, cost-effective solution that can perform mobilization rapidly. The current market is highly fragmented with no universal, cost effective, and rapid mobilization solutions available. Thus, there is a need for a solution that can achieve rapid mobilization with minimal effort on the part of the enterprise and at the same time provide the rich set of functionality that the enterprise requires.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to create a suite of consumer hardware and software products that provide realistic tactile feedback to users who are touching objects in virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR). As evidenced by the current proliferation of low-cost head-mounted displays and motion tracking systems, three-dimensional interaction technologies are revolutionizing how people interact with computers, media, and each other. Since they are currently limited to vision and audio, endowing consumer-level human-computer interfaces with high-fidelity tactile feedback will vastly increase user immersion, making games more fun, online interactions more effective, and tools more efficient. Consequently, this project has the potential to expand the commercial reach of the burgeoning VR/AR market, opening up myriad opportunities for companies particularly in the gaming, entertainment, and e-commerce sectors. The innovation of this project also promises to enhance scientific and technological understanding of haptic human-computer interaction by establishing a new paradigm that blends minimal wearable hardware with sophisticated software algorithms. Finally, commercializing novel interactive technology also has the potential to help inspire a diverse array of young people to pursue a career in the critical areas of science, technology, engineering, and math.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project aims to advance knowledge of low-cost technology that can provide realistic tactile feedback to a user touching objects in VR or AR: the project?s intellectual merits center on testing a new approach that combines minimal haptic hardware and sophisticated software algorithms. The research objective is to create a fully functional industrial prototype of a wearable fingertip thimble and custom software that embody the proposed approach. When the user's finger moves to touch a virtual object, a platform inside the thimble will initiate contact with the fingerpad and press with a force that varies with penetration distance, to render surface softness. A thermal actuator will convey the object?s thermal conductivity and temperature. When the finger slides along a virtual object, the user will feel its texture via carefully designed platform vibrations. Specific research tasks to be addressed include exploring haptic actuator options, building a library of haptic object properties (HOPs) that can be applied to virtual objects, and creating a communication protocol for exchanging haptic signals among devices. This project is expected to yield a fully functional industrial prototype and developer kits for the wearable fingertip thimble.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to understand the fundamental visual cues and characteristics of plants found in agricultural facilities for the purpose of rapid automated identification of plant species. The human eye, coupled with the brain?s processing power , can readily distinguish between different plant species. This capability was one of the basic needs for humans to become an agrarian society (farming requires weeding), which helped start enormous social advancement. Similarly, to bring automated systems to the next generation of capability, computer vision must interact with the natural world with greater fidelity. Today?s computer vision has ability to detect a ?splotch? of vegetation versus no vegetation. This project will advance computer vision by developing the equipment and software algorithms necessary to automatically distinguish plant types. The project team will build a computer vision algorithm based on a field customized support vector machine (SVM) that can automatically and reliably identify a known crop versus a foreign plant (i.e. weed) for use in a larger system for automated weeding. By creating the ability for computers to distinguish between plant types, we will enable food to be grown with reduced amounts of chemical herbicides.

    The broader impact/ commercial potential of this project is to increase the competitiveness of vegetable farms, particularly organic ones, while improving human health and the environment. Today, organic farms represent 5% of the U.S. agricultural economy and are growing at a pace to double organic acreage every 4 years. A key feature of organic farming is the lack of herbicides. Consequently, organic farms are normally weeded by hand. Weed control represents approximately 50% of operating costs for organic farms, compared to less than 10% for conventional ones. With an estimated $700M spent annually on weeding organic farms, there is a substantial commercial opportunity to create a system that can weed farms automatically. This project will develop a system that uses a computer system towed behind a tractor to automatically detect and eliminate weeds at early plant stages. The system can be developed and deployed at less than 1/5 the life-cycle costs of hand weeding. The technology is also applicable to conventional crop thinning where it can significantly reduce the amount of herbicides used. Additionally this technology has a profound health and sustainability benefits by eliminating human exposure to chemical herbicides through food and avoids herbicides leaching into the soil.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to further develop a novel computer vision based plant identification system for commercialization in agricultural weed control. This system will provide a cost competitive alternative to chemical herbicides, a global $20B market. Existing computer vision based approaches can segment a 'splotch' of green vegetation from a brown background but are unable to provide the selectivity and precision necessary for mechanized, automated weeding. This project's objective is to create software algorithms that match the capability of the human eye and brain to quickly and reliably classify plants into crops and weeds in real-time. The project team will build a computer vision algorithm based on a hierarchical classifier. This classifier will utilize a field customized support vector machine (SVM) that uses point-of-interest rather than shape-based methods, a novel approach to visual object identification. The result of this research will be the creation of an algorithm integrated into an automated weeding system.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is significant, as the development of an alternative to chemical intensive agricultural weed control will impact technological understanding, create commercial opportunity, and positively impact society. Technologically, the project will advance the fields of computer vision and machine learning through development of a real-time, automated plant identification system based on point-of-interest and SVMs. Commercially, the system will offer conventional farmers an effective and chemical-free method to eliminate weeds, and it will offer organic farmers the first truly precise organic weed control method. The addressable market for weed control in food production is estimated to be $4B in the U.S. The system's ability to eliminate the use of chemical herbicides has a profound societal effect. U.S. farmers apply over 250M pounds of herbicide annually on corn and soybeans alone, with many unintended and detrimental side effects. Chemical concentrations in rivers, lakes and groundwater are rising, and the prevalence of herbicide resistant weeds is growing exponentially. An alternative to these chemicals limits society's exposure while protecting environmental integrity.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate a proof-of-concept
    prototype of a high-throughput agile tile mosaic manufacturing system. Mosaics have proven to be a
    great source of visual splendor for thousands of years. Despite its prominence in art and architecture,
    mosaic is arduous to design and assemble by hand. The goal of this Phase I work is to prove the
    feasibility of a programmable high-throughput multi-head robotic tile assembly system to enhance the
    production agility of mosaic tilings. Research innovation in Phase I will merge the benefits of parallel
    tile placement with robust high-capacity tile cartridges to radically decrease tile mosaic fabrication time
    and associated tile mosaic assembly costs. The measurable objective of Phase I is a 5x increase in
    production throughput over current state-of-the-art mosaic manufacturing technology, while enhancing
    tile placement accuracy. The system will be capable of producing both template and ?mass customized?
    mosaics. In Phase II, the prototype will be refined into a commercial grade system, integrated with an
    Enterprise Resource Planning system, and placed into service in Artaic?s production environment.
    Successful Phase I/II demonstration will significantly lower the time and cost for manufacturing mosaics
    and potentially revolutionize the $76B global tile industry.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project goes beyond art, design, and architecture.
    Robotic automation will lower the cost of mosaic and increase its societal impact in adorning public,
    commercial, and residential spaces. The proposed research, if successful, will have a significant impact
    on agile manufacturing. It will allow penetration into unforeseen markets by reducing the cost of highthroughput flexible assembly. The solution proposed by the research will be immediately applicable to
    customers and partners, and potentially useful in parallel industries such as medical, pharmaceutical, food, consumer products, and others that will benefit from robotic agile manufacturing enabled mass customization. Agile mosaic manufacturing capability could revitalize the U.S. tile manufacturing industry and create job opportunities. The investigators estimate that a 5x production rate increase will enable a breakthrough price of $19.99, 75% lower than the competition, and for the first time achieve broad market affordability.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop a comprehensive software toolkit for creating digital mosaic artwork. Mosaics have proven to be a great source of visual splendor for thousands of years. Despite their prominence in art and architecture, mosaics are arduous to design and assemble by hand. The goal of this Phase I project is to build and test software tools to automate production of digital mosaic artwork. After integration with robotic assembly in Phase II, the proposed automation will significantly lower the time and cost for designing and manufacturing mosaic artwork.  In Phase I, Artaic proposes to combine two leading methodologies for digital tile layout - procedural and optimization-based algorithms - to closely mimic the workflow of mosaic artists. Artists will sketch curves to denote perceptually important edges along which the tiles should be oriented, while algorithms will determine tile placement in response to user-defined parameters, rendering styles, and composition rules

    If successful, this work will have broad commercial potential in art, design, and architecture. Software and robotic automation will lower the cost of mosaics and increase its traditional societal impact of adorning public, commercial, and residential spaces. This will also have spillover benefits, including growing use of this artform in advertising, entertainment, and visual effects.  The ultimate goal of Artaic is to leverage this software with custom robotics to create physical mosaics. This will enable Artaic to expand into a multi-billion dollar market and grow a domestic workforce. The fact that there is a software outlet for this work in addition to a proven commercial market for large-scale physical output adds to the case for the advancement of the proposed research.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will demonstrate a prototype of a
    high-throughput, agile, low-cost manufacturing system for tile mosaics. Mosaics have been a source of
    visual splendor for millennia, but they have always required arduous and painstaking hand assembly.
    Our Phase I proved the feasibility of a programmable, high-throughput robotic tile-assembly system to
    enhance the production of mosaic tilings. Phase II R&D will build upon Phase I success to further speed
    up, automate and scale the system, develop an effective agile manufacturing management system, and
    analyze the economic viability of robotic mosaic assembly for Phase III. We will accomplish this by
    enhancing the mechanical processes and reducing operator time - in addition to developing a productionflow
    information system. After Phase II system optimization, we will evaluate the commercial potential
    of the Artaic technology. The anticipated technical result will be providing a 5x faster manufacturing
    process with a 75% reduction in the price per square foot of customizable mosaic tilings produced. The
    intellectual merits of this SBIR project involve Artaic?s disruptive robotic technology, which transforms
    mosaic installation from its current, time-consuming manual labor processes to a rapid, robotically
    directed customizable process.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project expands the utilization of artisanal mosaic work
    while increasing the competitive advantage of U.S. manufacturing processes through increased
    automation and customization. Successful development of this technology will enable a breakthrough
    pricing structure that is 75% lower than the competition (based on manual and rudimentary automated
    processes), leading to broad market affordability and widespread commercial adoption. Our robotic
    system has the potential to revolutionize the $76B global tile industry, while creating numerous
    domestic job opportunities. Artaic expects that the 5x increase in manufacturing speed realized during
    Phase I will be maintained in Phase II during manufacturing scale-up without loss of placement
    accuracy. The increased understanding of robotic agile manufacturing-enabled mass customization
    processes will expand the scientific understanding of related robotic processes that utilize highthroughput
    flexible assemblies, such as for medical or pharmaceutical technologies, or for consumer
    products. In addition, classical mosaic techniques will become more accessible as an art form to all
    students, while undergraduate students will increase their understanding of STEM concepts through
    engineering courses utilizing this technology. Artists and designers will find the realization of their
    design work much more practical and affordable as a business enterprise.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a computer-aided mosaic
    design and robotic assembly system for automation of a centuries-old manual process. Despite their
    prominence in art and architecture, mosaics are arduous to design and assemble. Labor-intensive
    methods have stubbornly resisted automation, adding considerable cost and delay to projects. Artaic's
    Phase I research proved feasibility of computer-aided design software to create renderings and digital
    blueprints of artisanal mosaics by introducing a streamlined, procedural workflow for tile layout that
    closely mimicked the workflow of mosaic artists, and did so over 10x faster than manual methods. The
    goal of the Phase II research is to demonstrate the speed, effectiveness, utility, and artistic quality of this mosaic design and robotic assembly system. The key Phase II objectives are to: (1) demonstrate a
    prototype artisanal mosaic design system and; (2) demonstrate a robotic mosaic production system, that
    will be: (3) validated for accuracy, speed, and quality through user assessment, and; (4) evaluated for
    economic and commercial potential. Anticipated technical results will enable a revolutionary
    advancement from manual to automated processes in mosaic design and production, comparable to the
    displacement of film by digital camera technology.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project lies in art, design, construction, and
    architecture. Software and robotic automation will lower the cost of mosaics and increase its traditional
    societal impact of adorning public, commercial, and residential spaces. Artists, designers, and builders
    will have a significantly faster method to produce artisanal mosaics without the high cost and
    time associated with manual design and production. The efficiencies made possible by this proposed
    computer-aided mosaic design and manufacturing system will enable Artaic to expand into the global
    multi-billion dollar tile market and develop a domestic workforce to compete against global
    manufacturers of handcrafted mosaic artwork. Additionally, the computational demands of the rendering
    algorithms developed during Phase II will give impetus to further development of advanced GPUs and
    CPUs -- with companies such as Intel, Nvidia, and AMD providing solutions for increasingly more
    advanced rendering algorithms. Perhaps the most significant societal benefit from the development of
    this technology is its potential to make artisanal mosaic design and production accessible and affordable
    to the general public, and because this research enables any Photoshop artist to become a mosaic artist, it
    also hold significant promise as an educational tool in our nation's schools.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will pursue the development of a novel design architecture for recovering exhaust waste heat energy from an internal combustion engine by converting heat into electricity.  As vehicles become increasingly electrified, recovering a fraction of such heat by generating significant electrical power would off-load the vehicle alternator and substantially increase fuel economy.  The proposed innovation uniquely combines the latest advances in component technologies from fields in thermal management and energy conversion, resulting in a thermo-mechanical system that promises to be reliable, compact, and scalable while ?scavenging? significant power efficiently.  The research objectives include the preliminary design of a full-scale system and the design, fabrication, testing, and evaluation of a fractional proof-of-concept prototype.  Based upon results, the feasibility of the TEG system design will be ascertained, and its commercial viability evaluated more fully.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to recover a significant portion of the massive amounts of energy that is not utilized in our society but rejected in the form of waste heat from energy/power systems.  Exhaust heat rejected to the environment from internal combustion engines continues to be a significant untapped source of energy, representing over 40 percent of the available energy in these engines.  Most markets which utilize IC engines involve mobile or portable power such as automotive vehicles and military portable generators, requiring increasingly higher performance, efficiency, and reliability within a more compact and lightweight design ? key metrics addressed by the proposed innovation.  While reducing energy consumption in these applications, the innovation also reduces emissions since less fuel is consumed, helping companies meet stricter emission standards -- most notably the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFÉ) standards which impose high financial penalties for non-compliance.   Other adjacent markets include stationary power generation, solid-oxide fuel cells, and potentially aircraft propulsion systems.  In addition to meeting market need, the proposed design approach contributes technically towards new or improved system design methodologies and catalyzing system-level innovation ? a particular need in the area of automotive exhaust waste heat recovery.

- abstractText: |-
    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will pursue the full development of a novel system design architecture for thermoelectric generation (TEG) to recover exhaust waste heat from engines and convert it to electricity.  The effort will build upon Phase I achievements, which included a successful feasibility demonstration of a fractional proof-of-concept prototype and development and validation of a computer model, thereby proving the viability of this new system technology platform.  The technology enables efficient performance within a very compact and cost-effective form that also can easily scale in capacity.  The Phase II effort will involve improving subsystems and designing, modeling, fabricating, and testing a full TEG system for a passenger car application.  Furthermore, scalability will be explored by applying the TEG to a larger vehicle platform.

    the broader/commercial impact of this project lie in the fact that industry has found it very challenging to develop a TEG system design that meets market metrics of performance, reliability, compactness, and low-cost, particularly for automotive applications.  The proposed TEG system architecture, which includes a novel exhaust gas heat exchanger uniquely integrated into the remaining system, shows strong potential for meeting such metrics, and thereby achieving significant reduction in vehicle fuel consumption and emissions.  By penetrating the large passenger vehicle market, initial market introduction could easily range in the 100,000s and much more if the cost of the product is extremely low.  Broader opportunities to recover exhaust waste heat for transportation include medium- and heavy-duty vehicles, which may also be addressed by this scalable technology.  Other adjacent markets include stationary and mobile generator sets, solid-oxide fuel cells, and potentially, aircraft propulsion systems.  This commercial impact would greatly support national energy independence and greenhouse gas reductions.

- abstractText: "This Small Business Innovation Research(SBIR) Phase I project will
    demonstrate the feasibility of printing and integrating custom, unconventional
    form factor batteries utilizing a zinc-metal oxide battery chemistry with a novel
    ionic liquid gel electrolyte into next generation robotic systems. Conventional
    batteries have been unable to address the inherently challenging power system
    needs of robots: light and mobile, inherently safe, composed of cheap and sustainable
    materials, easily integrateable into non-planar formats, and able to survive extreme
    environments. As the field of robotics advances, what is being demanded of its
    batteries is a fundamental evolution in its materials, engineering, and architecture.
    Solution-based print manufacturing is used because the fabrication method is dynamic
    and enables batteries to be manufactured in a variety of form factors and on planar
    and non-planar substrates. In robotic devices, batteries can be incorporated into
    structural materials, conformably coated onto surfaces, or integrated within the
    electronic circuit boards to enable greater power performance that will increase
    the run-life and functionality of the robot. The aims of this project are to benchmark
    its battery technology's cycle life and extreme environmental stability capabilities,
    demonstrate the printing of custom series and parallel battery system configurations,
    and showcase its unique flexibility properties. \n\nThe broader impacts/commercial
    potential of this project are the establishment of a new battery technology and
    manufacturing paradigm which can be disruptive to markets requiring novel device
    functionality and form factors. The significant reduction of the cost and environmental
    impact of batteries offer an opportunity to key segments such as robotics the
    opportunity to repurpose and revitalize the printing industry to manufacture next
    generation batteries. Success in this project will showcase this battery technology's
    feature set and manufacturing methodology to further differentiate itself from
    its competitors, increase customer interest, secure early customer development
    funding or partnerships, and meet specifications needed to scale towards producing
    commercial products. Past approaches to battery miniaturization have been met
    with significant barriers that have limited market acceptance and restrained development
    of a variety of burgeoning fields requiring portable power. A prime example is
    the robotics market and more specifically the wireless and wearable technologies
    sectors, which could be revolutionized by the battery technology and manufacturing
    approach presented in this project."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the development of a cornerstone for reliable electricity and a modernized grid able to evolve alongside emerging customer demands. Reliable electricity is key component of an industrialized market, critical for the information age, and an enabler for non-industrialized regions evolution and eventual world economic contribution.  The societal benefit therefore of GridBridge's commercially feasible Grid Energy Router is colossal, as it is the step-function change required to truly orchestrate a grid to match this era.  This project will enable numerous hindered technologies and scientific understanding related to energy storage, photovoltaic and other renewable generation, as well as electric vehicles and their correlated fast chargers.  Energy savings are also a monumental aspect and are expected to be in the trillions of dollars.  Society needs electricity to maintain civilization and an updated grid is imperative for supplying that electricity to an evolved consumer base.  GridBridge?s Grid Energy Router will be the crucial component for the modernized grid an enabler for numerous complementary technologies.  GridBridge's GER will eventually replace millions of installed legacy grid technologies throughout the world.  Furthermore, the continued GridBridge-ERC relationship establishes FREEDM ERC's commercialization ecosystem, which includes 200 diverse students.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project combines various research aspects to commercialize the company?s third breakthrough product for electric utilities, the Grid Energy Router (GER).  GridBridge?s Grid Energy Router will be cornerstone for an evolved grid that can integrate renewables and storage, offer dynamic efficiency gains, and intelligently route power.  Although there has been early work with power electronics merely focusing in the area of high-voltage conversion, the approaches thus far limit commercialization and manufacturability.  GridBridge will combine over three years of company market research and utility voice of the customer, a unique product roadmap, and cutting edge research in the areas of feature implementation and voltage conversion.  Keeping in mind the end market, electric utility requirements have been incorporated: highly efficient, cost-competitive, manufacturable within a specific market window, and scalable both to high power and high voltage.  This project facilitates a cost-effective and electrically-efficient product design ready for industrialization and ultimately grid integration, while simultaneously incorporating valuable features that justify utility expenditure and meet a market window of need.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will prove the feasibility of a low-dose 4D cone beam tomosynthesis reconstruction algorithm for use in medical image-guided interventions. Despite the availability of highly accurate 3D guidance systems, most image-guided interventions are still performed under 2D fluoroscopy. 3D guidance is significantly more complex and expensive, as it requires the combination of 3D imaging (like CT) with surgical navigation, both expensive and complex technologies. A system capable of reconstructing a 4D scene would provide accurate and easy to use guidance for the medical professional, at lower costs. This research will develop a 3D reconstruction algorithm with quasi real-time performance (4D) that does not increase exposure to x-rays when compared to 2D fluoroscopy. The proposed technology will combine the most recent advancements in tomosynthesis, iterative reconstruction and compressed sensing and fundamentally change image-guided interventions.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is that advanced medical procedures, like minimally invasive surgery, will be significantly improved in workflow and accessibility, reducing healthcare costs, improving outcomes and improving quality of life for patients. In the U.S. alone, a 10% shift to minimally invasive spine surgeries can reduce healthcare costs by $180M while reducing patient trauma and providing faster recoveries to 45,000 patients. This technology could be applied in other clinical areas like oncology and interventional radiology, improving a broad array of procedures and bringing a new level of excellence in medical interventions. 4D systems would compete in the intra-operative x-ray medical imaging market, a $1B market that is growing 6% annually, and in the Surgical Navigation market, a $400M market that is growing 9% annually. The proposed concept has the potential to disrupt both these markets by replacing pairs of intra-operative 3D imaging and surgical navigation systems with one 4D system that is more cost effective and easier to use.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the significant improvement of
    surgical accuracy, which will dramatically reduce surgical errors, improve outcomes and
    reduce healthcare costs. In spine surgery alone, there are more than 500,000
    procedures every year in the US utilizing implants such as screws. In 4% to 11% of
    these surgeries, the implant placement is inaccurate. For the patient this translates into
    longer recoveries - from days to weeks - and in many cases into a second revision
    surgery. The patient is non-productive, unable to carry out their daily routines for weeks,
    while the healthcare system has to absorb the costs of the longer recovery as well as
    the revision surgeries. For both the healthcare and economic systems these are
    avoidable costs. The medical imaging technology being developed in this project has
    the potential to eliminate surgical inaccuracies across the $2.4B market of image
    guidance, improving clinical applications that range from orthopedic surgery to minimally
    invasive vascular interventions, to cancer diagnosis and treatments.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project will demonstrate a
    novel imaging modality, which provides near-real-time 3D live imaging - 4D - during
    surgery. This novel system will provide surgical imaging at a lower x-ray dose than
    fluoroscopy (current standard), with a geometry that allows concurrent imaging with
    surgery. This 4D technology has the potential to significantly reduce surgical
    inaccuracies, improve outcomes and reduce costs. Phase 1 successfully demonstrated
    the feasibility of the reconstruction algorithm used by the proposed imaging modality by
    showing its potential of higher surgical accuracy in a single spinal screw insertion. This
    Phase 2 project will I) prove the robustness of the reconstruction algorithm across a
    variety of use-cases, II) demonstrate the clinical usability of the 4D scanner, and III)
    confirm the clinical utility of the scanner. The clinical usability will be studied with an
    ergonomic model in a surgical setting. The clinical utility will be proven by building a
    system prototype and performing image quality and x-ray dose comparisons versus
    fluoroscopy and 3D in a realistic surgical setting. Preliminary results show that these
    objectives are achievable. This research is readying the technology for clinical research,
    regulatory clearance and commercialization.

    In many fields of human knowledge and activity, a common feature is that information
    content is expanding at such a rate that finding relevant results to searches
    for solutions is becoming increasingly difficult. A further problem is that even
    the high quality material is expanding at such a rate that most disciplines are
    rapidly forming sub-disciplines. As fields continue to both expand both at the
    top levels in terms of overall amount of knowledge, and to expand at the more
    granular levels by fragmentation into ever more numerous subfields, each of which
    may develop its own journals, conferences and even terminology, impenetrable to
    the outsider. It's becoming impossible to stay current. Yet much of creativity
    occurs, and indeed a great many of the world?s great inventions have occurred,
    precisely at the intersections between different fields. The central objective

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to accelerate the pace
    of research and development to enable more rapid deployment of technologies
    into commercial / industrial contexts. In many fields, information is expanding at
    such an exponential rate that finding relevant results to technical knowledge
    searches is increasingly difficult. Further, content is expanding so fast that most
    fields are rapidly forming sub-disciplines, leading to the ?silo-ing? of different
    knowledge sub-domains, a clear challenge to both academia and industry. We
    need ever better ways to organize and present information to users. There are
    disadvantages of the current search engines, mostly relating to excessive
    similarity in search results. Further, while these engines present information
    relating to a known search target, they are less effective at presenting
    unexpected results for information that a user has never heard of but that would
    be useful. What is therefore needed is an exploration system giving searchers a
    strong serendipitous element with a maximum likelihood of results from diverse,
    unexpected, and potentially provocative sources. This will break down silos by
    providing a rapid, relevant means for knowledge-transfer between different
    disciplines, fostering interdisciplinary innovation. This system has been designed
    to provide a means for systematic, automated discovery.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project is focused on
    optimizing and scaling a serendipitous document search system for repurposing
    technologies by analogy into lateral fields. Both by sub-parsing discrete content
    into ontologically separable entities, such as capability, characteristic, and
    composition, and by comparatively assessing certain of these attributes between
    such entities, the attribute relatedness of these entities can be used to drive their
    self-assembly into related attribute networks. This approach provides a
    significant value proposition for drug repurposing, which is the current focus of
    this project. To scale the pair-wise comparison and network assembly of millions
    of documents, a map-reduce based text-processing framework will be developed
    so that massively parallel computations can be carried out in a time- and costefficient
    manner. A distributed search engine technology will be deployed to
    enable rapid querying of the emerging document relationship network. A series of
    machine learning algorithms will then be used to determine potentially hidden
    structural architectural features within the document relationship network.
    Machine learning will elucidate the nature of the relationships in drug networks
    through analyses of inter-node relationships and sub-graph motifs (termed
    ?innovation motifs?). Documents including U.S. patents and scientific papers will
    be processed in the system.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is clear from the size of the market in warehousing and logistics. The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that the annual cost of moving inventory by hand in warehouses is 5 billion dollars. Industry is eager to adopt new robotic technology, and it has already made a significant impact in many aspects of this problem, speeding shipments and lowering costs. However, handling individual items has not yet proven viable when the range of objects is large. The grasping robot developed in this project will meet this need, and reduce the cost of logistics for manufacturers, distributors, and customers. Additionally, the creation of robot grasping systems that can automatically grasp a wide range of objects will open up the benefits of robotic technology to workers in other industries. This is critical to making robots accessible to small manufacturing shops, and will significantly improve the performance of telepresence systems used for military, rescue, and consumer applications such as home assistance for the elderly.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase I project is based on a decade of university research on the design and construction of robots for grasping using passive mechanisms. Through the carefully tuned structural compliance of the fingers, robot hands can be designed to compensate for variation in the size, shape and location of grasped objects to obtain reliable grasps. During the course of this project, a commercial product will be developed capable of picking and placing a wide range of items at extremely low error rates, something that has hitherto been considered a hard problem in sensing and planning. The new compliant grippers, combined with breakthroughs in low-cost tactile sensing and simplified grasp planning, will enable a level of performance that meets the needs of real-world customers. The new picking robot will be validated against a set of realistic items picked from bins in a simulated warehouse environment.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project affects one of the fastest-growing sectors of the US economy. E-commerce sales in 2015 accounted for 7.4% of total U.S. retail and are expected to rapidly rise. The potential for the commercial impact of general each-picking systems is high, as current manual labor methods are pain points for distribution centers; human picking is unpleasant, expensive and inefficient due to high absenteeism, high turnover and human error. The success of the proposed technology will also contribute to American competitiveness in the robotics industry. Of the top 20 distribution system integrators, only three are currently based in the U.S. Robotics is going to be the key driver of progress in this area, where each-picking, our core product capability, is a key component of future automated distribution systems. Beyond warehousing logistics, applications that our technology can benefit include: broad applications of industrial automation and manufacturing; military applications (e.g., IED disposal, where robots can perform tasks that are dangerous for humans to perform); and assistive healthcare (e.g., where robots must be compliant enough to be safe around humans while interacting successfully with unknown environments).

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will focus on the development of a state-of-the-art each-picking robotic system and its deployment, initially targeted at the order fulfillment industry. To date, robotic systems have enabled significant progress on transporting inventory on shelves or in totes. However, there has not yet been a deployed system that can perform the task of picking individual items from inventory bins and placing them in boxes for shipment. During Phase I of this project, RightHand Robotics developed a picking system far in advance of the research literature on robotic grasping, picking tens of thousands of items previously unseen objects, with error rates of less than 0.1%. During Phase II, the project will focus on advancing the state of the art in data-driven refinement of grasp planning using machine learning techniques, and will develop methods for box-packing that exploit the company?s advanced compliant grippers. These improvements will result in an average pick-and-place time of 6 seconds or less and an undetected placement failure rate of fewer one in ten thousand.

This project will address a slew of recent problems with software failures, security compromises, and other unintentional software behaviors that occur inevitably as systems become more complex, potentially saving lives and making millions of vehicles safer, easier to upgrade, and better tested.  The commercial value follows the need of manufacturers to retain the basic vehicle safety guarantees while pursuing the commercial necessities of competing on complex software-driven features, ultimately minimizing software development costs and expensive car recalls.  The enhanced scientific and technological understanding from this technology will come as it is deployed in the field, giving manufacturers an impetus to formalize and standardize existing requirements, bolstering their understanding of the software systems in the car.  The technology will also foster the formalization of both open and proprietary specifications, further increasing the understanding of complex automotive systems by facilitating complete analysis.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will for the first time explore the application of provably correct runtime verification software to real-time systems.  An efficient and certifying framework allowing for the expression of a diverse range of specifications will enable applications of runtime verification in automobiles, aeronautics, and beyond.  One research objective is to develop a system that can monitor any safety property, generating high-performance C code capable of running on virtually any hardware.  This will combine efficient monitoring with maximal formal guarantees in terms of correctness.  Formal verification was previously realized only for mathematical models of monitors, or in systems with very low expressiveness.  A second research objective is to study the applicability of runtime verification by collecting properties from automotive industry standards, evaluating the complexity of specifying the properties, the possibility of recovering from detected violations, and the performance requirements of the resulting monitors. It is anticipated that hundreds or even thousands of such properties will be monitored simultaneously.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is that the proposed runtime verification technology will lead to a more robust definition of and architecture for ensuring safety in automobiles, medical devices, and aerospace and defense systems.  Through this, these forms of safety-critical infrastructure will be more resilient to attack and catastrophic failure resulting from both critical system failures and malicious attacks.  As a result, the technology will help to address a slew of recent problems with software failures, security compromises, and other unintentional software behaviors that inevitably occur as systems become more complex, potentially saving lives and making millions of safety-critical embedded systems safer, easier to upgrade, and better tested.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will commercialize a first-of-its-kind complete solution for runtime verification and software analysis specifically tailored for embedded systems.  From automobiles that connect to each other and drive autonomously, to control systems that run ever increasing networks that power our utilities, cities, and many other aspects of our daily lives, it is clear that embedded systems are here to stay in the most safety critical domains.  A growing problem in embedded systems is how to ensure they behave correctly; a good case study for this is automobiles, in which several high profile hacks and recalls have called into question the security and integrity of vehicles.  The proposed solution will fill this market niche with a suite of related analysis tools/modules, built on a common novel and formally rigorous runtime verification technology infrastructure, each module implementing unique instrumentation and analysis functionality.  These tools/modules together provide what is needed to develop safe embedded systems.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop an efficient remote monitoring and diagnostic software system to detect and diagnose software defects in cyber-physical systems (CPSs). CPSs have the potential to bring about a revolution in efficiency, robustness, and safety in application domains such as smart utility grids and smart health care. To unleash their potential, CPSs must themselves be robust. However, despite state-of-the-art testing, software defects currently do escape into deployed CPSs. Current state-of-practice monitoring and diagnostic systems cannot improve the situation as they were not designed with the constraints of CPSs in mind, which include real-time execution, unreliable links, and resource constrained processors. The proposed technology is aimed at creating a software system capable of monitoring embedded nodes in CPSs for anomalies and providing detailed execution information to quickly diagnose the software defects responsible for any anomalies. The proposed work extends the company's extensive research in efficient collection of information for diagnosing software defects. The company expects to create a prototype monitoring and diagnostic software system for CPSs and demonstrate its effectiveness on existing software defects in CPSs.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project derives from the fact that increasing the reliability and robustness of CPSs will directly increase their adoption in real world applications. CPS technology is directly applicable to a broad range of sectors, including utility grids, smart buildings, manufacturing, health care, transportation, etc. These sectors account for more than $32.3 trillion in economic activity, with the potential to grow to $82 trillion by 2025 - about one half of the global economy. CPSs are thus critical to the national interest in areas such as manufacturing competitiveness, defense, health care, energy production and usage, and disaster monitoring and recovery. Due to the increasing reliance on CPSs in the future, system defects could have drastic consequences. The proposed technology could significantly improve reliability of CPSs by catching defects before they result in significant loss, outages, or failures.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to empower farmers to capture a greater share of revenue from the marketing of their crops.  Agriculture is a significant engine to the U.S. economy, and farming itself is vital to creating economically vibrant rural areas.  Farmers are often at a disadvantage when it comes to capturing good prices from their crops because there are significant information asymmetries in the marketing supply chain.  This project develops a combination of hardware and analytics that greatly improves crop forecasts at dramatically more accessible prices, which allows farmers and their trusted buyers to make more informed marketing decisions.  An addition to the narrow application of sensing hardware and analytics for forecasting, the data collected by the platform can also be used by growers to make decisions that improve operational performance of complex agribusinesses and improve the agronomy of the farm. These tools make it easier to compare performance of crops to improve yields and reduce resource costs.  Together this technology continues to raise productivity and profitability per farmer.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project integrates a  novel plant and weather sensing platform with analytics that synthesizes data into actionable forms that can drive agribusiness decisions.   The project bundles a suite of capabilities into a single hardware unit that includes sensing, communications, GPS, mounting, and solar power, which dramatically reduces the cost and increases the simplicity of collecting agricultural data.  These data are uniquely designed to monitor crop performance and its sensitivity to weather and management.   Data synthesis is a critical pain point in transforming raw numbers into insights for growers to act upon. By creating an integrated hardware platform, the data is poised to provide useful advice that allow a farmer to act on emerging situations, anticipate upcoming events, and even predict the future.  A research objective will be to generate probabilistic forecasts that use the unique data from our hardware to estimate key crop growth parameters and project forward for an operational yield forecast.  This coupling between highly informative quantitative in-field data and sophisticated ensemble-based parameter estimation and forecast techniques could dramatically improve marketing decisions and help farmers capture better prices for their products.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project consists of three major pieces.  First is the reduction of musculoskeletal injuries for manual laborers, which already affects 600,000 workers each year. This will improve the quality of life of laborers, since an injury at work affects both their work life and their personal life.  Second is to reduce the high costs associated to these injuries that need to be paid by employers, and which are estimated to be $15.2bn a year. These costs challenge the competitiveness of these companies.  Thirdly, the worker injuries affect employee morale, absenteeism, productivity loss and employee turnover, all of which are challenges to the efficient running of a company.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will study the feasibility of automatically evaluating the risk of musculoskeletal injury in the workplace using smart wearable devices. These injuries affect hundreds of thousands of workers per year in the US, and cost US companies more than $15bn in direct costs. This research goal depends on the achievement of two technical objectives (i) to prove that the sensors and developed algorithms can differentiate lifting events from other worker activities, and (ii) to demonstrate that the data collected by the sensors can be used to accurately predict the output of the NIOSH lifting equation, an ergonomics risk model widely accepted in industry. Estimations of the outputs of the equation performed by our device will be compared by those computed manually by a certified ergonomist. These wearable devices can quantify the risk of musculoskeletal injuries continuously over time, providing a deeper understanding of the factors that affect risk and the ability to take measures to reduce that risk before an injury occurs.

    material handling workers with novel wearable devices'
- abstractText: |-
    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project has the objective of demonstrating that discrete, belt mounted internet-connected wearable devices used by industrial workers can detect high risk lifting activities, promote safe lifting practices and behavior change, and predict the risk of musculoskeletal injuries due to unsafe lifting. Each year over 600,000 workers suffer a musculoskeletal injury due to lifting related activities, which cost US companies over $15bn annually. Worker injuries affect employee morale, absenteeism, productivity loss and employee turnover, all of which are challenges to the efficient running of a company and are a unnecessary cause of human suffering. By developing a wearable device that can detect high risk lifting activity and provide immediate feedback to workers, safer lifting practices can be promoted and a reduction in the number of unsafe lifts registered, leading to a reduction in injuries.

    The project includes three main technical objectives: i) the development of machine learning algorithms to detect lifting events from sensor data, and to measure risk related metrics associated to those lifting events. When a lift is considered high risk, real-time feedback will be provided to the worker; ii) the deployment of the device in an industrial setting at several customer sites for 12 months, with the number of high risk lifts performed by workers quantified over time to measure the ability of the system to drive behavior change in the workforce; and ii) the development of a model that can predict the likelihood of musculoskeletal injures based on the risk metrics measured. It is expected that the outcomes of the project demonstrate a significant reduction in the risk of suffering musculoskeletal injuries, paving the way for a clear return on investment value proposition for the industrial companies and their insurance carriers who are potential customers.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be on the Real Estate Industry, specifically targeted at the Multi-Family-Home (MFH) industry, to help them increase revenue potential by digitizing their apartments through Smart Home Automation. It is estimated that the Smart Home Automation industry will reach $71B by 2018. The MFH industry will participate through additional charges to the residents for smart home automation support. However, the bigger increase in revenue will most likely come from better data and insights on their buildings which leads to opportunities to monetize that data and sell software targeted at MFH buildings. In addition to increased revenue, there is potential to save costs through more efficient use of labor and materials and through better management of energy. The MFH industry can also get insights on their entire building portfolio versus a single building and more efficiently manage their entire portfolio.  The MFH industry implementing Smart Home Automation technology has huge societal benefits by integrating with smart grids and utility demand response programs.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to enable the deployment of a scalable and maintainable infrastructure through the use of mechanisms including automatic pairing, tiered authentication, and network isolation in low cost, resource-constrained Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The problem with existing IoT pairing methods is that they are targeted at Single-Family-Home deployments and the number of nodes that needs to be paired are relatively minimal. However, this is not a scalable model when trying to address the needs of the Multi-Family-Home (MFH) industry.  In the multi-family dwelling, the sheer density of nodes creates new problems. The issue is that all the devices could easily be paired but to differentiate the nodes so that they authenticate and provision to the right apartment is the challenge. Developing a cost effective, scalable solution for this high-density scenario is a key component to fulfilling the value proposition of mass deployment in the Multi-Family-Home industry. The anticipated result of this project is that a proof of concept will be developed that gives directional guidance on the best way to solve the issue of pairing large quantities of end nodes and authenticating them appropriately to the correct apartment.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to bring a disruptive neutron detector technology to market, filling an urgent need for real-time, portable and wearable radiation detectors. Successful commercialization of this innovative technology will serve a broad customer base in the nuclear detection and verification industry. This includes nuclear power industry workers, national lab staff, and homeland security personnel, all of whom need to detect the presence of neutron-emitting radioactive materials and assess the health physics risks in real time.  This multi-billion dollar market is currently well served with gamma ray and x-ray detection devices, but the capabilities for wearable neutron dosimeters and detectors are currently less well developed.  The proposed technology closes this gap and thus addresses new commercial opportunities across a targeted array of markets: in addition to supporting U.S. technology leadership and safer low-carbon nuclear energy generation, this project will explore new kinds of directional arrays for neutron imaging and portal detectors, helping to make the nation's borders more secure against illicit nuclear materials and providing improved tools for nuclear safeguards and verification.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will evaluate the feasibility of a novel compact, wearable neutron detector/dosimeter based solely on solid-state technology. Research objectives include a thorough quantitative assessment of the detector front-end material response to neutron radiation, evaluation of its optoelectronic characteristics, and gamma discrimination. This will be the first detector of its kind, enabling portability, low cost, real time signal capability and complete integration with semiconductor microdevice technology.  The novel device concept combines a directional optical converter (neutrons to secondary electrons to light) with state-of-the-art optoelectronic detection to provide a digital output which is compatible with wireless reporting protocols and internet integration.  The proposed device can therefore be reconfigured for many radiation detection tasks that are currently not feasible with larger, bulky devices using conventional gas proportional and scintillator detector technology.  The anticipated result is a novel disruptive neutron detection approach.   The research to be performed at the forefront of neutron detection science includes a thorough evaluation of the neutron-capture process, and aims for the first time to better understand the radiation response of a high density of large capture cross-section nuclei in a high-purity optical medium.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the potential to bring a disruptive neutron detector technology to market, filling an urgent demonstrated need for real time, portable and wearable radiation detectors. Successful commercialization of the innovative Cerenkov BoroSilicate Glass (CBSG) technology will serve a broad customer base in the nuclear detection and verification industry. Market research indicates large scale potential, in the billions of dollars. This market is currently well served with gamma ray and x-ray detection devices, but the capabilities for portable and wearable neutron detectors are not as well established. The proposed technology will close this gap and is anticipated to have a very broad impact. The Cerenkov detector technology can also be transformative in enabling new kinds of directional arrays for neutron imaging and portal detectors, helping to make the nation's borders more secure against illicit nuclear materials and providing improved tools for nuclear safeguards and verification.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to commercialize an innovative neutron detector module based 100% on solid-state technology. The overall objective of the project is to build on the successful Cerenkov BoroSilicate Glass (CBSG) detector prototyping in Phase I/IB to develop a small, low cost, modular neutron detector which can be integrated with existing gamma detector technologies to 1) form a comprehensive, scalable, networked solution to the problem of Special Nuclear Material detection; 2) enable inexpensive in-house and third party integration of neutron detection technology into radioisotope identification devices and personal radiation dosimeters; and 3) allow for  further testing and advanced product development relating to directional neutron detector networks, direct fast neutron detectors, and neutron spectroscopy. The research objectives include a thorough quantitative assessment of the detector front-end material response to neutron radiation and evaluation of its optoelectronic characteristics. In particular, in collaboration with a specialty glass manufacturer, the isotopic composition of glass front-end will be optimized for fast neutron detection. The anticipated result is a novel and disruptive neutron detection approach.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to enable various low latency video applications that are not possible today.  One of the most interesting is in the area of cloud computing, in which a server in a data center somewhere on the Internet runs a client's application remotely, and delivers the frame-by-frame video to the client's viewer.  This allows for a very cheap client device, consisting of just a video decoder and an input such as a mouse pad, while graphic or compute intensive tasks run on powerful servers in the cloud that can be leased to the client on an as-needed basis.  This server-client model could also be used internally at a company or school, greatly simplifying IT requirements.  And for high security applications there is also an advantage, as all data is stored remotely.  There is nothing local on the user's device to be compromised.  Cloud computing services such as these are already coming on line, but the range of applications they can run is limited by the lack of good low latency video encoding.  Solving this problem opens up a whole new paradigm of how people purchase, maintain and use personal computers and software.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project investigates techniques for real-time ultra low latency video compression.  The goal of the research is to enable the encoding and transmission of video over a communications medium such as the Internet, cell phone network, satellite network, etc. such that the video may be viewed at the receiving end with no more than 1 frame of latency from when it was encoded at the source.  The best and newest industry-standard video compression specification, called H.265, will be used as a framework such that the resulting compressed video can be readily decoded by widely available software or hardware.  Framework tools and techniques to monitor and adjust the bit rate of the compressed video will be developed and tested to achieve the low latency goals while maintaining high visual quality of the compressed video.  The result of this research will be a set of algorithms that can be used in the design of an H.265 video encoder that will achieve the low latency goal, as well as a characterization of the limitations of these algorithms such that their applicability to various real-world opportunities can be assessed.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to promote and improve the use of high quality video in products that the general public works with every day.  From high resolution auto dashboard cameras, to low latency video streams from flying drones, to wireless laptop docking stations, to higher quality coverage of news and sporting events, to better and faster delivery of video over the Internet, every application requires the high quality, low latency, flexible, power efficient video encoders that will be developed in this project.  The uses of video are increasing every day.  Video instruction manuals are replacing printed instruction manuals.  Video is replacing still images in on-line advertising, social media and billboards.  It is predicted that over 90% of all Internet traffic will be video data in the next few years.  Enabling all these applications requires the latest technology in video compression such as the techniques developed in this project.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project tackles the problem of creating a real time video encoder, using the latest H.265 compression technology, running in hardware on an FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array).  An FPGA is a type of chip on which the logic is configurable - it can be programmed to implement any function.  It represents a mid-point between a dedicated integrated circuit, which is very expensive to develop, and can never be changed or enhanced once it is fabricated, and a pure software solution which is very flexible but requires bulky and power hungry equipment (i.e. computers) as an underlying platform.  The research conducted under this grant will devise, test, and implement algorithms that are amenable to realization on an FPGA, that operate in real time, and that yield a high quality result in terms of the visual quality of the compressed video with respect to the number of bits used.  The goal, at the conclusion of this research, is the demonstration of a functional HEVC/H.265 encoder running on an FPGA which has cost, flexibility, power and performance advantages over other encoders.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be a substantially more effective and efficient error correction scheme for flash memory than exists today. This will provide better reliability and extend the life of flash memory and will have a major impact on several technologies and markets such as enterprise storage at data centers, solid state drives, tablets, smart phones, and other consumer electronics. The flash memory market was estimated to include $30.1 billion in production and sales in 2013 and is expected to grow to $43.9 billion by 2018. The enterprise storage market is estimated to be $1 billion in 2014 and a robust growth is expected over the next few years. A substantial fraction of this market is related to error correction controllers for flash memories which are playing an even more important goal than ever considering the rapid scaling down and increasing capacities of flash memories which introduce more read errors than before.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will address and develop tools to overcome problems that have traditionally prevented low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes from being deployed in flash memories  and error correction controllers. A major problem is that these codes have error floors which prevent them from achieving very low error probabilities required in flash memories. In order to overcome this deficiency, new algorithms will be developed to understand the nature of the problem and to eliminate it using advanced signal processing methods. Area and energy efficient decoder technologies will be developed that make LDPC codes suitable for flash applications. This will include research optimizing LDPC based error correction systems for area and energy efficiency and elimination of the error floor problem. It will also include research on optimizing the detailed circuit design.

- abstractText: |-
    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be high performance error correction for flash memory. Error correction plays a critical row in making digital devices reliable. Shrinking semiconductor geometries results in more errors. This has created a special problem for flash memory where the need for more rigorous error correction is approaching a practical limit with the widely used Bose Chaudhuri Hocquengham error correction. Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) is a recognized solution that  can approach the theoretical limits of what is possible. This LDPC based technology can improve lifetime of flash by without the added cost of the existing BCH solution. This technology helps Flash Memory enterprises to use higher density flash to improve storage capacity and cut the storage product costs. Without the superior performance, small size and low power consumption of the LDPC technology, the migration to low cost high capacity flash memories will be seriously slowed. In the absence of a comparable alternative approach, there will be serious limitations on the performance of a vast array of products that depend on highly reliable and economical flash storage.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will use a variety of  techniques to minimize the area and power requirements and enhance the performance of Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) error correction codes for flash memory. Many of these techniques are applicable to a wide range of error correction applications in digital communication and storage from WiFi to hard disk drives. The need for better error correction is crucial for flash memory but there is a widening demand for improved error correction. For example larger memories require better error correction to insure the system failure rate is low. In the next two years the company expects to develop a Verilog version of the LDPC decoder that is easily integrated with a flash controller. The project will work with potential customers/partners to ensure the code works with controllers. In the long run these techniques can be adapted to a wide range of applications as the need for more reliable data continues to rapidly expand.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this SBIR Phase II project will be the enhanced ability to monitor NOx optically using a unique approach that is fundamentally different from voltage biased solid electrolyte diffusion technology deployed commercially today. NSF Phase I activities brought to light the shortcomings of existing sensor technology, including slow response time and up to 90% "garbage data" that OEMs and regulatory authorities have to work around. Phase II efforts include improvement of Phase I prototypes where near instantaneous NOx detection to ~200 ppm was observed. NOx are a major pollutant and precursor to acid rain, surface ozone and smog formation. Worldwide regulatory bodies are driving NOx regulations to increasingly stringent levels, thus presenting even greater challenges for real-world emissions. Addressing these regulations, industry must deploy after-treatment technologies including selective catalyst reduction systems and lean NOx traps. Both of these technologies will benefit from a less expensive, more robust, and faster responding NOx sensor. With continued success, the new NOx sensor has the potential to significantly reduce emissions levels through a more accurate and much faster detection than current NOx detection techniques thus allowing the internal combustion engine to directly employ detection feedback to enhance emission controls.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will continue the prototyping and characterization of an optical based Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) sensor technology not based on oxygen sensor derivatives found in the market today. We will further optimize the design and materials needed for a novel thermo-catalytic NOx sensing mechanism through continued experimentation and testing. Increasing the number and type of catalytic sensing elements and integrating them into existing OEM packaging will allow us to measure NOx as well as other gases including ammonia (NH3). Sensor calibration equations and response lookup-tables will help validate our new method for NOx detection with successful results creating the foundation of a new category of sensors based on this differential detection architecture. Current automotive NOx sensors do not meet response time, accuracy and price requirements as used in the industry where such parameters are critical. The Phase II will optimize the optical sensing mechanism, and planned designs of experiment will help refine this technology into a reliable and robust device. Besides NOx and NH3, our "inorganic taste buds" also derive carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbon concentration as a byproduct of the measurement process, thus providing additional utility for any combustion emissions control application.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to introduce and establish the foundations of a new class of electronic products - ultra-thin electronic devices embedded in thin, flexible, inexpensive, and environmentally friendly substrates such as common paper. The ultra-thin embedded electronics offer superior cost, flexibility, reliability, and security characteristics relative to conventional flexible electronics. The most significant applicable market for such products in the near term is that for Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID)-based devices. In 2014, shipments of passive RFID tags will approach 7 billion having a value of about $3.5 billion and an annual growth rate of about 25%. However, the application of the ultra-thin embedded electronics technology extends well beyond RFID.  It encompasses both defense and commercial applications within the general category of flexible hybrid electronics. Examples of defense applications include wearable health monitors, disposable sensors, embedded sensors with communication capability for monitoring equipment and structural health, etc. Examples of commercial applications are counterfeit-proof 'smart' security, legal, and financial documents, wearable and disposable electronics, interactive media, and intelligent product packaging.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to study the feasibility of embedding ultra-thin electronic devices in thin flexible materials such as paper. Paper has been considered extensively as a substrate material for printed electronics. However, embedding ultra-thin, silicon-based flexible electronic devices inside paper during the paper making process has not been researched. Similarly, an extensive body of knowledge exists on the topic of device reliability. However, current research is almost entirely focused on the interconnection system between the chip and circuit board and on the situations where the entire device is subjected to cyclic thermal and/or mechanical stresses. Embedding hybrid electronic devices in thin flexible materials requires the semiconductor chips to be extremely thin, less than 50 microns and preferably about 20-25 microns thick.  This is significantly thinner than the conventional chips. Still, no research has exclusively considered the survivability of such chips and the entire embedded electronic device under the stress and strain conditions typical for the paper making process. The results from this study will pave the path to developing ultra-thin electronic devices embedded in other thin flexible materials such as polymers, composites, and synthetic paper.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to reduce the power consumption of display and lighting products by 90%. It will do so by enabling the pervasive use of light emitting diodes (LEDs) in such products. LEDs consume substantially less power than other display/lighting technologies and also offer benefits such as superior picture or lighting quality and longer lifespan. The foremost barrier to the emergence of such products is the difficulty of economically placing large quantities of LEDs onto a product grid. For example, if current-day methods are used to create a full high definition display, its assembly would take about a month and drive its cost far beyond what the market could accept. This project's innovation addresses this problem with a laser-based, ultra-high speed LED placement solution. Beyond this immediate application, it will further the industry's technical capabilities relative to electronics component assembly in general. The commercial potential for chip-based LED display and lighting products is expected to reach about $10 billion within five years. The market for LED placement solutions in support of these products will be about $1 billion in this same time frame.

    The proposed project addresses the above problem by demonstrating an ultra-high speed LED placement method that can reduce the one month assembly time in the example above to just one minute. This solution, unlike others in development, increases the placement rate of LEDs by a factor of 10,000 and includes the ability to pre-screen and replace non-functional LEDs. This project will demonstrate the core aspect of this solution involving the placement of multiple, very small LEDs ("microLEDs") using a single laser pulse diffracted into multiple scanned beams. It will use this solution to demonstrate the extremely fast assembly of a quantum dot-based microLED display. The project will build upon a related, previously demonstrated capability applied to larger, silicon dies. Each aspect of the technology (wafer preparation, single laser beam placement, multi-beam placement) will be individually optimized for the new conditions imposed by the smaller sized, sapphire-based microLEDs. This new, LED-tailored capability will then be used to demonstrate the assembly of a four thousand pixel microLED display in under one second thereby achieving the project's goal of demonstrating a >50M units/hour LED placement rate.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to address one of the primary barriers to the emergence of flexible electronics -the inability to assembly and interconnect thinned integrated circuits (ICs) onto flexible substrates in a reliable, cost-effective, high volume manner. Flexible electronics has been the subject of many industry journals, trade shows, technical conferences and market research reports. All describe a new age of ubiquitous electronics with devices embedded in the structures and items around us.  Flexible electronic devices, unlike today's devices that are rigid and boxy, can conform to natural, curved shapes that exist in the real world. However, flexible electronics have yet to have their predicted economic and social impact. A major reason is because the electronics industry has not yet found a reliable, low-cost method for assembling thin, flexible ICs onto flexible circuit boards. Today's 'pick-and-place' assembly technology cannot handle ICs thin enough to be flexible. Until a new method is developed and adopted, the potential of flexible electronics will likely not be realized.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will advance the integrated circuit (IC) aspects of a flexible hybrid electronics technology to a level at which these devices can be produced reliably and in volumes in a production-relevant environment. While most of the components of flexible hybrid electronics technology relating to printed electronics methods have been adequately researched and developed, little has been done on the integration of solid-state semiconductor devices onto highly flexible, organic substrates. Partial results have been reported in the literature, however, no attempt has been made to provide a comprehensive, wafer-to-end product approach suitable for commercial applications. This project will address this gap by focusing on all the steps for IC integration, including the preparation for assembly of ultra-thin, flexible semiconductor dies, their attachment onto a flexible circuit board using laser-enabled assembly technology, and their reliable electrical interconnection. The anticipated end results will be a complete flexible hybrid electronics integration technology developed to a level of pilot production readiness.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is that it will dramatically increase the efficiency of communications networks. Commercially, the ability to dynamically, adaptively and optimally route traffic on data networks will lead to network cost savings ranging from 60% - 70% for network service providers. Critically, the project leverages the recent industry shift towards software-defined networking (SDN) that is projected to become a $45 billion market by 2020. The excitement behind SDN is driven primarily by the promised performance benefits of better traffic control. By bringing to market its provably optimal, dynamic and adaptive traffic control algorithms, the company will be uniquely positioned to capitalize on this market opportunity. The immediate resulting social impact will be that end users will have access to faster, cheaper and more robust data networks. In the longer term, efficient software control of networks will enable rapid innovation in networking leading to new network applications that have not even been envisioned yet. The project also enhances technological and scientific understanding by commercially verifying the company's solution to a longstanding open problem in networking - namely, whether an easy to deploy, dynamic, adaptive and optimal routing algorithm can be found.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on delivering commercial, smart, traffic control algorithms that can unlock the full capacity of modern communications networks. Today, due to unprecedented traffic growth, network operators face major challenges in the form of efficient resource utilization. The problem is that the inherent randomness of data traffic has led to network designers over-provisioning networks to the point where they run at 30% - 40% utilization on average. The company's competitive advantage is a new algorithm that allows it to optimally manage traffic variations by adjusting network routes in real time while retaining the scalability and simplicity of today's protocols. The goal in this project is to build on the beta tests from Phase I by developing an enterprise-grade, cloud-based network control application that is ready for general market launch. To this end, the company will start with small commercial deployments at selected test partners. Feedback from these deployments will be used to iron out any issues before general market launch. By the end of the project, the company anticipates generating significant revenue from initial customers as it continues to innovate and maintain its current lead in developing SDN control plane software.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to create custom crafted voices for text-to-speech
    applications that empower recipients to engage in conversation and be heard in
    his/her own voice.  The company's technology blends a recipient's residual vocal
    abilities and a matched donor's speech database to craft a personalized voice
    that combines the recipient's vocal identity with the clarity of the donor's speech.
    In the United States alone, there are over 2.5 million individuals with speech
    impairment and 3-5 million individuals with low vision who rely on a limited set
    of generic, mechanical sounding voices for assisted communication. It is not uncommon
    for several children in a classroom or adults in a workplace to use the same synthetic
    voice. Each one of us has a unique voiceprint that conveys our age, gender, race,
    size, and personality. Until now, this variety and flexibility of voice has not
    been afforded to users of speech synthesis technology. The company's goal is to
    give the gift of voice to all those who need and want it to enhance how they learn,
    work and play.  \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project
    aims to engineer personalized synthetic voices that convey the recipient's unique
    vocal identity. The company's innovation is grounded in the source-filter theory
    of speech production which divides the speech signal into a source component (the
    vocal folds) and a filter component (the rest of the vocal tract) that are largely
    independent. Because source and filter characteristics both contribute to speaker
    identity, the key challenge is to create an authentic, yet understandable voice
    by extracting as much identity information from recipient vocalizations as possible
    and combining it with speech clarity information from the donor. Standard voice
    conversion methods require large amounts of spoken data from donors and recipients
    as well as parallel corpora, which are not available for the target applications.
    This Phase I work will make significant advances toward the design and implementation
    of a novel automated voice matching and transformation process that leverages
    a large database of healthy donors' speech to generate personalized synthetic
    voices from sparse samples of target recipients' vocalizations. Algorithms will
    be validated using both quantitative and perceptual metrics to assess intelligibility,
    similarity and naturalness."

- abstractText: |-
    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to offer custom crafted digital voices for text-to-speech applications. Each one of us has a unique voiceprint - an essential part of our self-identity. Though the quality of text-to-speech technology has improved, voice options remain limited. For the 2.5 million Americans (and tens of millions worldwide) living with voicelessness who rely on devices to talk, access to a custom digital voice is a game changer. It's the difference between a functional solution and being heard, uniquely, as oneself. Enhanced opportunities for social connection increase quality of life, independence, and access to educational and vocational resources that can narrow the gap between those with and without disability. This immediate unmet societal need, coupled with the increasing proliferation of devices that speak to us and for us, creates a compelling, timely and significant commercial opportunity for high quality, personalized digital voices that can be produced at scale. By leveraging the company's crowdsourced human voicebank and proprietary voice matching and blending algorithms the technology has the potential to empower everyone to express themselves through their own voice.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project builds on the company's NSF-funded research and Phase I results that support feasibility and commercialization of a customized voice building technology. The text-to-speech market, encompassing assistive technologies, enterprise and consumer applications, is currently valued at around $1B and is rapidly growing and ripe for innovation. To create custom voices, the company leverages the source-filter theory of speech production. From those who are unable or unwilling to record several hours of speech the company extracts a brief vocal sample - even a single vowel contains enough 'vocal DNA' to seed the personalization process. Identity cues of the source are then combined with filter properties of a demographically and acoustically matched donor in the company's voicebank. The result is a voice that captures the vocal identity of the recipient but the clarity of the donor. Phase II technical objectives address the need for 1) customer-driven voice customization, 2) quality assurance of crowdsourced recordings, 3) voice aging algorithms, and 4) targeted donor recruitment algorithms. These advances will help secure the assistive technology beachhead and spur innovations for broader applications such as virtual reality, personal robotics, and digital persona for the Internet of Things.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project results from its potential to transform professional networking from passive to pro-active. People-information is valuable for business professionals in sales, marketing, recruiting, fundraising, M&A and business development, to establish connections, generate leads, and generally maximize opportunities.  This project will further commercialize big data analysis techniques to quickly capture, filter, and analyze people related information from the whole Internet, and present such information to users via mobile and web services for various use cases such as networking at events, etc.  These services will enable mobile users to plan in advance whom they should meet at events, and equip them with much deeper insights regarding their prospects than are currently available, so that they can generate business more efficiently.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is intended to further develop and commercialize the company's big data analysis and mining technology for people-information, with specific emphasis on making professional networking at events/meetings more productive and efficient. It provides a real-time, instant, "people research" capability on mobile devices to enable effective networking at business events, trade shows, conferences and private/Meetup meetings. It goes beyond existing "name-based" keyword search provided by commonly-used search engines, and is complementary to social network sites, which rely purely on subjective information provided by users themselves. Based on the company's current collaboration with large event organizers and their marketing/sales teams, the project will further extend the event mobile solution for enterprise customers by providing an organizer self-service (SaaS) platform, integrating with their CRMs, and leveraging Beacon technology to track attendee activities and interests in trade shows. In addition, it will include more advanced features to motivate individual users to use the app more frequently, including outside such events. Finally, it will build a platform with APIs to allow OEM partners to generate and use the people-information in activities such as recruiting, marketing, etc.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be the creation of tools that democratize a new interactive medium called projection mapping. Projection mapping uses video projectors to overlay digital content (images, animations or video) onto 3D physical objects, allowing viewers to experience and interact with digital experiences in an entirely new way. These interactive displays will add value to a wide range of industries where dynamic, 3D presentations are needed to inform, educate, advertise or entertain. Applications include educational experiences at museums or schools, healthcare applications for rehabilitation and visualization, new training and simulation displays, as well as broad uses in advertising and entertainment. For example, a retail end aisle display could more easily attract customers by demonstrating product features with projected light directly on or around the physical product. Alternatively, an interactive diorama in a museum could allow visitors to learn history through an immersive visual experience. This project will bring projection mapping from high budget, niche markets into low budget, mainstream markets. Cost reductions will be realized through technological advances that decrease design, setup and calibration requirements, which in turn will advance technological capabilities and content authoring.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to develop a novel software and hardware system for authoring projection mapping content. The proposed system will greatly simplify a currently complex content authoring process, and will enable entirely new passive and interactive experiences which fuse digital content with the physical environment. The system is comprised of a content authoring software suite and a projector-depth camera hardware unit capable of high-resolution 3D scanning. Research objectives entail novel software algorithms in the areas of 1) automatic calibration of projector-camera systems, 2) optimized structured light scanning of 3D objects, 3) automatic, precise re-alignment and registration of the system in response to movement of the physical model, 4) intuitive authoring tools for creating passive and interactive projection mapping experiences.

    demonstrates the feasibility of a sketching system that bridges traditional drawing
    and three-dimensional modeling, offering a novel way to develop, explore and share
    visual ideas in 3-D. Using a fusion of hand-drawn strokes and captured imagery
    that can replicate the spatial and geometrical relationships found in the real
    world, these scenes are developed in 3-D at a speed and flexibility impossible
    with existing technology. The success and widespread adoption of the technology
    depends on the creation of a compelling and intuitive user experience. In order
    to confirm feasibility and bring the new platform to the market, the primary objective
    of this project is to complete the development of a tablet-based version of the
    system. The proposed research necessary to achieve this goal includes four interrelated
    parts: capture and exploration of exterior scenes, development of a user interface
    tailored to the new sketch paradigm, expansion of the sketching system to leverage
    data captured dynamically in situ, and a thorough evaluation of the user experience.
    \n\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to develop technology
    that will directly impact creative design as practiced by professionals (e.g.,
    architects, film makers, engineers, artists) by offering a new platform for creating
    and editing 3-D scenes, and will also impact the communication of ideas, where
    D representations predominate. In today's market place, the competitive position
    of many firms is often determined by their ability to rapidly design products,
    generate concepts, and evaluate new solutions. Moreover, over 70% of design costs
    are committed during the conceptual design phase. This technology has the potential
    to markedly speed this phase while qualitatively improving the development of
    these ideas. 3-D printing technology presents another application for this technology,
    whose commercialization (even to home users) has increased the demand for CAD
    software by hobbyists, independent inventors, and small businesses. The technology
    developed through this project will seize on this market opportunity and will
    also generate other business opportunities in software authoring tools, direct
    content creation, and consulting services. The core technology will also have
    applications in areas of cultural heritage, consumer marketing, and advertising."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project results from the development  of a new class of graphical-media-design system that lies between today's 2D digital paint systems and 3D computer-aided design systems. This technology will allow architects, engineers, artists, and school children to create compelling 3D experiences directly from their drawings without extensive training. Furthermore, it will accelerate the creation of interactive 3D content and significantly reduce the time, cost and expertise currently required to create it. By bridging the gap between traditional drawings and 3D modeling, this project will provide the unique ability to reuse and "reproject" drawn strokes, thus enabling the creation of expressive 3D drawings with minimal effort. The technology developed in this project will help lower the barrier and generate new business opportunities in content creation for electronic publishing and for other creative professionals, such as architects, designers, and ad-agency art directors. Finally, this project includes specific outreach activities, through collaboration with the American Museum of Natural History, that will provide unique educational services to the local community, while simultaneously introducing this new technology to the world.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will focus on making the creation of this new type of graphical media as intuitive and fluid as paper and pencil. This Phase II project will support system improvements - including user-interface improvements - to simplify 3D navigation for the consumers of this media. This will be needed for using this media in digital children's picture books, which have already been identified as early adopters of this technology as well as an important market. Another technical objective will be to develop a hybrid vector-raster representation, which will provide a wider range of artistic expression, while improving rendering performance of large scenes. A third objective is to develop stroke deformation algorithms to support direct manipulation of objects and characters to provide sketch-driven animation capabilities.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to greatly improve the robustness and diagnosability of many real world cloud computing infrastructures. The proposed technology will significantly reduce the downtime of production cloud systems, which can attract more users to adopt cloud computing technology and thus benefit the expanding segment of society and the economy that depends on cloud technology. The project will also advance the state of the art of cloud system reliability research by putting research results into real world use.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will transform system anomaly management for production cloud computing infrastructures. The novelty of the company's solution lies in three unique features: 1) it provides automatic multivariate anomaly detection that can enable high-fidelity anomaly alerts without imposing any configuration burden on the user; 2) it provides early anomaly alerts before big system problems occur; and 3) it provides anomaly diagnosis that can generate hints on why an anomaly occurs. The proposed research will produce novel and practical anomaly prediction and diagnosis solutions that will be validated in real world cloud infrastructures. Specifically, the project consists of two thrusts: 1) online multivariate anomaly prediction that explores new light-weight unsupervised learning algorithms for achieving high-fidelity anomaly alerts and providing time-to-failure estimations; and 2) automatic anomaly diagnosis that can identify possible causes of an anomaly to greatly expedite the anomaly troubleshooting process in the cloud. The company will implement the software products and carry out case studies with partners on real world cloud computing infrastructures.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will fundamentally change what a storage device can do, and give storage a third capability that was not addressed by existing storage technology - the ability to actually process the data under the explicit control of the user.  For the computation to take place, only the computational request and the resulting data need to transfer over the storage interface, reducing the interface traffic and the required power. The advent of Big Data and the increasing use of Hyperscale Server technology have resulted in the creation of an additional storage tier that is different from traditional enterprise storage. This new tier requires significantly larger capacity with lower cost and lower operating power, and yet must still exhibit enterprise reliability. This combination of characteristics cannot be serviced by existing technologies, and execution with large data sets typical of Big Data results in inefficient solutions.  The information being stored represents the large, unstructured data mined by today's companies for key information and trends that help dictate corporate direction, advertising, and monetization. Future applications include real-time distributed video and image processing, genome sequencing and mining of any unstructured Big Data.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project explores the Big Data paradigm shift where processing capability is pushed as close to the data as possible. The in-situ processing technology pushes this concept to the absolute limit, by putting the computational capability directly into the storage itself and eliminating the need to move the data to main memory before processing. The technology innovation begins with a solid foundation of an enterprise SSD tailored for the needs of modern Data Centers. Key technology that will be added to support these capabilities include hardware-assisted quality of service control, low-cost TLC/3D-TLC NAND Flash enablement through the use of advanced ECC, and a proprietary elastic Flash Translation Layer to support extremely large capacity drives. The final element added to this foundation will be the ability to perform computations directly on the data with the addition of specialized in-situ processing aided by hardware accelerators.  To make this disruptive solution as non-invasive as possible, a level of system software is needed to make adoption as seamless as possible.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to fundamentally change what a storage device can do, and give storage a third capability that is not addressed by existing storage technology - the ability to actually process user data.  For the computation to take place, only the computational request and the resulting data need to transfer over the storage interface, reducing interface traffic and the required power. The advent of Big Data and the increasing use of Hyperscale Server technology have resulted in the creation of an additional storage tier that is different from traditional enterprise storage. This new tier requires significantly larger capacity yet lower cost, lower operating power, and yet must still exhibit enterprise level reliability. This combination of characteristics cannot be serviced by existing technologies, and execution with large data sets typical of Big Data results in inefficient solutions. The information being stored represents the large, unstructured data mined by today's companies for key information and trends that help dictate corporate direction, advertising, and monetization. Future applications include machine learning for video analytics, genome sequencing and enabling Fog Storage and Fog Computing, among others.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will establish the feasibility and commercial potential of developing software technologies that enable disaster recovery and high availability for cloud-based web applications and mobile app back-ends (apps). The innovations address the key pain points associated with public cloud use as revealed by interviews conducted as part of the NSF I-Corps program: disruption, privacy, and lock-in.  The project plan is to design, develop, and empirically evaluate the utility, scale, and commercial potential of cutting edge proprietary software products that automate and make migration and failover easy for app developers that employ cloud-based services to implement their apps.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project results from its ability to benefit a wide constituency.  On the commercial side, cloud and platform-as-a-service (PaaS) markets are growing at an alarming pace. This project is unique in that it combines the benefits of modern cloud platforms with the key missing pieces of all extant approaches to PaaS:  disaster recovery, easy migration, and hybrid cloud use by apps and data across public and on-premise deployment options. The simplification enabled by this cloud platform with a disaster recovery solution lowers the barrier to entry and reduces both the risk and cost associated with public cloud use.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project results from lowering the barrier to entry for, and simplifying the use of, cloud computing systems via a novel, open source, cloud platform.  The proposed advances have the potential to facilitate and expedite innovation and technological progress by a diverse software and global developer community, enabling more people to tackle the important yet increasingly challenging and data-intensive computing problems facing businesses today. The company's technologies address directly the key pain points of this explosively growing platform-as-a-service (PaaS) and cloud-based application development market - namely privacy, lock-in, and control.  Unique to the company's approach is compatibility with a leading, proprietary, public cloud PaaS standard (Google App Engine).  As such, the company's solutions have significant commercial potential because they are directly applicable to businesses that employ App Engine today (there are currently over 4.5 million active applications), and they lay the groundwork for addressing the larger PaaS market in the long term.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is based on a distributed system that executes and manages web-based and mobile cloud applications (apps) via automation, thereby relieving developers, operations staff, and Information Technology (IT) groups of the burden of doing so.  The proposed technology advances address the issue of vendor lock-in - i.e. the use of proprietary technologies, services, and systems that effectively prevent users from switching to alternative vendors.  In the cloud space, lock-in is proliferated through the use of (i) proprietary interfaces and tools, (ii) complex pricing models, and (iii) the lack of interoperability across vendors.  The proposed technology disrupts lock-in by public cloud vendors by automating software deployment and management across clouds, and by making it easy to move applications and data between vendor offerings and on-premise clusters. In particular, the company's technologies abstract away the complexities of cloud use, and provide monitoring, backup/restoration, and migration of applications and data across clouds at the push of a button.  By providing features that are currently unavailable today, the proposed technologies have significant potential for reducing the cost, risk, and learning curve associated with cloud-based development, deployment, disaster recovery, and migration for the next generation of cloud applications.

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is considerable because a variety of complementary
    new technologies is ushering in a new era in which visual messages are becoming
    a first-class media type along-side text and speech.  Today, both amateur and
    professional videographers still have to enter the virtual darkroom to sift through
    video, edit it, and produce engaging content.  Video creation is waiting for its
    Polaroid moment, when a technological solution will transform the post-production
    time required to create engaging video.  If successful, the technology developed
    in this project will greatly increase the utility of any video capture device
    and would have implications outside of Internet media in areas such as life recording
    and knowledge transfer. The countless video clips of important or memorable events
    that are today commonly archived and forgotten could instead be automatically
    summarized and made available in a usable and engaging format. \n\nThis Small
    Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to evaluate the technical
    viability of an automatic video summarization system based on neural networks
    and adapted to measurements of human psychology.  As people collectively record
    more videos than they can possibly consume (the video deluge problem), a technology
    that automatically turns raw videos into relevant and engaging summaries becomes
    increasingly critical.  The company's proposed platform would streamline video
    sharing, search, and viewing, all of which are staples of our online lives.  Scientifically
    we are at a unique time in the capabilities of artificial visual systems, with
    some systems rivaling human performance in limited domains.  Furthermore, the
    field of visual psychology has also seen recent progress in relating visual semantic
    information to cognitive phenomena, like memorability of images.  Taken together,
    it may now be possible to automatically predict the cognitive relevance of visual
    information and produce effective video summarizations.  This project combines
    deep neural networks for visual object recognition, recurrent networks for contextually
    embedded temporal information, and user measurement of interest, memorability,
    and uniqueness.  The primary technical objective is to determine whether a system
    can automatically predict human-produced video summarizations."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be in the field of healthcare.  The United States spends approximately $9,000 per person per year on healthcare.  Ultrasound medical imaging is a medical imaging technology that could lower costs by providing an alternative to higher-cost imaging techniques.  The technology created during this Phase II project is expected to increase the quality, value, and accessibility of medical ultrasound, which would in turn reduce medical imaging costs in the US healthcare system.  Furthermore, the company's technology is expected to bring ultrasound to more clinical settings and improve system-wide efficiencies in the diagnosis and treatment of disease.  The technology also has commercial potential in the international market, with $5.8B spent annually on medical ultrasound devices worldwide.  Finally, by improving the utility of ultrasound, the technology will lead to improved patient care and may ultimately save lives.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop deep learning technology for ultrasound imaging in medicine.  Ultrasound imaging has numerous benefits including real-time image acquisition, non-invasive scanning, low-cost devices, and no known side-effects (it is non-ionizing).  However, variability in quality has encumbered its adoption and utility.  As a result, more expensive imaging is typically utilized, often exposing patients to ionizing radiation.  Our objective is to develop, improve, and test machine learning techniques, based on deep learning, to improve ultrasound acquisition and interpretation.  We expect this project will create novel technologies that make ultrasound easier to use and improve the quality of ultrasound examinations.  The end result will improve the quality, value, and accessibility of medical ultrasound examinations, will result in cost savings to the healthcare system, will produce improvements in patient care, and will support a sustainable business opportunity.

    a sports video search engine developed by the team at MIT. The approach combines
    semantic information mined from speech transcriptions with visual information
    extracted using video analysis algorithms. The proposed research will extend the
    existing software algorithms that have been developed for baseball video to other
    professional and college sports. Additional software tools will be developed to
    increase the accuracy of the search system, and new user interfaces based on natural
    language processing algorithms will be designed to enable simplified user access
    to video. The anticipated result of this research is a method for accurate video
    search and indexing that enables queries by natural language and requires significantly
    less human labor to initially tag video than existing techniques. \n\nThe broader
    impact of this research comes from the commercialization of this technology as
    a service layer which provides search and indexing solutions to multiple market
    segments that together represent a multibillion dollar industry in the United
    States. The research meets the needs of at least three market segments: (1) Sports
    professionals, who will gain powerful video access tools enabling better player
    evaluation, recruiting, coaching, and game analysis; (2) Sports news providers,
    who will be able to link news stories to related video clips thereby adding value
    to their media offerings; (3) Sports fans, who will be able to search and browse
    sports video archives with ease, providing new opportunities for advertising.
    Initial market research suggests that the access enabled by this technology would
    have broad impact on how sports video is used. Furthermore, the approach may later
    be extended to apply beyond sports to other video domains."

    This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).

    The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project objective is to commercialize a novel technology for indexing video. The company's approach automatically integrates information from speech, text, and video through algorithms that generate rich semantic indexes for video. The Phase I results show that this approach can be incorporated into a system that indexes video with high accuracy and at a fraction of the cost of currently used methods. Further, during the Phase I research, the company has identified a large and growing consumer market (sports video) in which the technology can be applied.  The technical objectives of the Phase II proposal focus on working with such partners to roll out initial Bluefin-powered applications, such as content-based search and video-enriched fantasy sports. Such applications are currently not feasible because of the low accuracy of automated indexing methods and the high cost of manual approaches to indexing video.

    Millions of hours of new video content are coming online every month, feeding an exploding demand and reshaping the nature of the Internet. Just as text-oriented search engines were necessary to empower users to find what they needed during the first phase of the text-centric Internet, a new generation of technology will be necessary to organize and effectively find content in the fast-approaching video-dominated era of the Internet. Bluefin Lab is pioneering a new approach to video organization and search by commercializing cross-modal algorithms developed in Academe. While this differentiated technology can be leveraged in several target markets, the company's initial focus is on sports media where it will power a unique experience for video search, video-enhanced fantasy sports, and other video-centric applications.

    This SBIR Phase II project applies data mining and machine learning techniques to both natural language description and Internet link graphs to model communities in order to predict preference, taste and sentiment for different kinds of media (music, TV, online media, video games, books). Current contextual information mining approaches that scan the text on a page for advertisement or recommendation ignore valuable community connections inherent in most self-published Internet discussion. Sentiment and opinion extraction systems operating on full text create challenging language parsing problems are fraught with issues of scale and adaptability.  The identification systems can automatically categorize anonymous Internet writers or website visitors into specific demographic communities based on their tastes in many kinds of media. The Phase II research project approaches opinion extraction with a bias-free learning model based on training from known online corpuses that can be adapted to different languages and learns in real time as more data becomes available for high accuracy.

    Current personalization and marketing approaches either look at the "clickstream" of an anonymous user, leading to equally anonymous recommendations for popular movies and music -- or by scanning a surface-level overview of the text, leading to keyword advertisements with limited contextual understanding of entertainment content and community sentiment.  The project plans  to fully integrate people-focused community and sentiment analysis technologies into an autonomous, learning and scale-free "media knowledge service" for digital entertainment providers and marketers that can change the way digital content is marketed and sold.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a scale-up manufacturing process of nitric oxide-releasing silica nanoparticles. The main challenge is controlling the nanoparticle crystal size while maintaining high levels of nitric oxide storage.  In this project, critical process parameters including reactant addition rate, reaction temperature and mixing rate will be studied. The Balanced-Nucleation and Growth (BNG) Model will be utilized to transform process data into predictors of controlled particle size.

    The broader/commercial impact of this project will be the potential to provide large-volume nitric oxide-releasing silica nanoparticles for placement in products aimed at the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases.  Availability of large-quantity nitric oxide-releasing silica nanoparticles is important to combat the rising number of nosocomial infections.  However, the necessary scale-up technology to manufacture nitric oxide-releasing silica nanoparticles is not available.  This project is expected to provide the processes to manufacture large quantities of nitric oxide-releasing silica nanoparticles for anti-infective product development.

    are uniquely qualified to perform improved laser glaucoma surgical techniques,
    since energy threshold requirements for tissue ablation are nearly 100 times less
    than with existing pulsed clinical lasers.  This translates into minimal damage

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)Phase II project will develop an optimized ultra-short pulsed laser surgical device for high precision surgery in the sclera of the eye.  This tool may enable novel, office-based procedures to treat serious and common conditions, such as glaucoma and presbyopia.
    Phase I study results will be used to guide development of a new solid-state high power femtosecond laser source and scanning optical delivery system.  Performance will be evaluated in ex vivo human and animal tissue.  It is anticipated that this tool will be used to test long-lasting and minimally invasive glaucoma and presbyopia surgical procedures performed in the sclera.  These procedures will be developed through follow-up in vivo evaluations conducted in collaboration with researchers at the University of Michigan (to whom the device will be made available).  By providing a tool for non-invasive scleral channel formation, investigators will be able to address long-standing questions about why current glaucoma surgery fails, as well as how the loss of accommodation can be reversed.  These developments will raise the possibility of direct intervention for the two million Americans who have glaucoma and the millions more who suffer from presbyopia.
         The market for glaucoma is estimated at over $5 billion, while the potential market for presbyopia is probably several times greater. Since both glaucoma and presbyopia are associated with aging, their incidence is expected to rise.  The potential for low cost, office-based surgical procedures that are more effective than any current technique offers a compelling business model for the anticipated result of this proposal.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to create a new, innovative system to manage a highly-scalable, geographically-distributed labor force through wireless technology - what is refered to as " mobile crowdsourcing."  The plunging cost of handsets and the introduction of prepaid call plans have allowed individuals throughout the world to have the ability to communicate and transact electronically. This project will create the infrastructure needed to provide wireless subscribers the ability to do work and earn money - leveraging today's mobile phone's ability to send, receive and display images, audio files and text. The system will: deconstruct a client's work into "micro-tasks;" preferentially route micro-tasks to individuals most likely able to complete them; statistically analyze completed work across individual responses to automatically reach a decision on when work is complete, and who has provided the most useful input; compensate workers in proportion to the value they have added; and, finally, reconstruct the completed task for the client, with a statistical assurance the work has been accomplished correctly.

    The first application of this system will be for the business process outsourcing (BPO) industry. The company will integrate with several mobile carriers in Africa and South America to allow subscribers direct access to transactional BPO tasks including transcription, translation and text categorization. Communicating with workers directly through phones  and emphasizing quality control on work, rather than worker will enable users to perform tasks when they want, where they want, and as they want. Automated compensation through existing mobile payment and airtime transfer systems will allow for much lower overhead costs. In addition to cost savings, however, clients who use this system to complete work will also have the benefits of: increased security (no one worker will be able to see an entire document or hear an entire audio recording), access to a scalable workforce (when "spikes" of work come through, labor can be seamlessly scaled up), and potential for very fast turnaround on work (micro-tasks can be done in parallel by many individuals, greatly reducing total time to complete a workload). Additional applications of the mobile crowdsourcing platform include data gathering related to local content and surveys, productivity tools for auditors, and mass reporting abilities following disaster-related events.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to make next generation sequencing technology for small RNA more quantitative and less biased. High throughput sequencing has transformed the landscape of genomic research with its ability to produce gigabases of data in a single run. This has enabled researchers to perform genome wide and high depth sequencing studies that would normally not be possible. Despite this capacity, amplification artifacts introduced during PCR increase the chance of duplicate reads and uneven distribution of read coverage. Accurate profiling using deep sequencing also has been undermined by biases with over or under-represented miRNAs. The presence of these biases significantly limits the incredible sensitivity and accuracy made possible by next generation sequencing. The goal of this proposal is to develop novel, bias-reducing technology for making amplification-free small RNA libraries. The company's kits and protocols will ramp-up considerably the rate at which global microRNA profiles can be determined, and that between-sample and within-sample differences (as well as newly discovered small RNAs) can be subsequently validated. This product will result in a major shift in the way small RNA sequencing is performed and pave the way for unbiased measurements in the clinic.

    The broader impact of this project will be the accurate measure of small RNAs, and the clinical utility of such a profile. Products of the same microRNA gene that vary in length by one or two nucleotides are involved in a whole host of diseases, including cancer. The value for developing a method to measure the true profile of microRNAs in a sample would be immense for the research community studying transcriptional regulation, and would open the doors to clinicians interested in capitalizing on the diagnostic value of microRNA profiling. Companies whose sole model is to extract prognostic information from microRNA profiles would benefit from the wealth of date generated from accurate non-biased high throughout sequencing. The size of the next generation sequencing market is expected to pass $4 billion by 2014. Growth in the sequencing diagnostic market is just beginning. Unique diagnostic kits developed from this technology will fulfill an unmet market opportunity with the potential to exceed $15 million in the first 3 years.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to examine high throughput methods to quantify intacellular microRNA (miRNA) concentrations in cells that have shown to be associated with normal physiological processes as well as diseases including cancer. Currently, there are no rapid, quantitative methods available to measure miRNA expression in living cells or tumor tissue. All current in vitro approaches require extensive preparation involving extraction, reverse transcription of miRNA into cDNA, and amplification. These methods are not only time consuming, but require that the low abundance miRNA be several fold greater than background to give a significant result. To meet the demand for a diagnostic/prognostic tool, we propose development of a biomolecular detection device based on a single electron transistor to bind and measure the concentration of miRNAs, giving a researcher or clinician an accurate profile to make proper clinical assessments. In addition, we propose development of fluorescent probes designed to bind to miRNAs intra-cellularly and fluoresce upon recognition. Developing these high-throughput methods to detect miRNA at the single cell level will give us direct information on intracellular miRNA levels, miRNAs that are essential for identifying tumor maintenance or metastasis, thus creating new diagnostic and therapeutic opportunities.

    The broader/commercial impact of this project will be to enhance current diagnostic and prognostic tools for early detection of disease. Today, early cancer detection and treatment offers the best outcome for patients. This has driven the search for effective diagnostics. The identification of a universal tumor-specific epitope or marker has remained elusive. While many types of serological and serum markers have included enzymes, proteins, hormones, mucin, and blood group substances, at this time there are no effective diagnostic tests for cancer that are highly specific, sensitive, economical and rapid. This deficiency means that many cases of malignancy go undetected long past the time of effective treatment. The goal of this research is to develop clinical diagnostic tools where miRNA profiles can be examined from patient samples immediately in a hospital or clinical setting. The current size of the in vitro diagnostic market is estimated to be over $40 billion. Unique diagnostic kits developed from this technology will likely fulfill an unmet market opportunity with the potential to exceed $100 million in the first 3 - 5 years.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop technologies that optimize the use of RNA interference (RNAi) in animals. RNAi is an invaluable tool for characterizing gene function and is a promising candidate for gene therapy. The use of RNAi in tissue culture is well developed but is of limited use in experimental animals. RNAi agents must enter cells to exert their effects but this has proven to be challenging in animals. The current lack of such technologies is holding back the majority of important RNAi animal experiments. To open this bottleneck, kits and reagents will be developed based on Bioo Scientific?s Targeted Transport Technology (T3). Easy-to-use RNAi delivery products will be manufactured, validated and commercialized for use in animal experiments.

    The broader impacts of this research are twofold. First, researchers will gain ready access to products that greatly simplify the use of RNAi in animals, thereby, stimulating a burst of validation experiments in animals to try to replicate prior results derived from tissue culture experiments. Animals are more complex than their tissue culture counterparts and it is uncertain that results can be duplicated in an animal. Second, T3 has the potential to be used for the therapeutic delivery of RNAi agents. In sum, this project will propel the validation of tissue culture results via T3 enabled animal experimentation, leading to a better understanding of cellular pathways, the identification of novel drug targets, and the potential to deliver RNAi agents as drugs.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project seeks to address the steadily growing but unsustainable polymer matrix composite (PMC) market. PMCs are leveraged for their high strength-to-weight and stiffness-to-weight ratios as compared to conventional engineering materials, but are notoriously unsustainable, energy-intensive to manufacture, and non-recyclable.  Researchers have investigated encapsulating natural fibers with both petroleum-based polymers and biopolymers (e.g. cellulosic plastic) to produce more biocompatible composites with varying degrees of experimental and commercial success, but all attempts have still fallen short of an ideal "bio-composite". In this project, we will create and characterize an entirely new bio-composite material. The basic idea is to use mycelium as a matrix for binding natural fibers and core filler materials together in sustainable composite parts.  First, the core bulk material is bound together over time by mycelium growing into and around common bulk agricultural waste such as cotton hulls.  Then, reinforcing layers made from natural fibers (e.g., hemp) inoculated with fungal cells are applied to the core faces, allowed to infiltrate the laminate and bind to the core material, and then heated to inactivate the growth process to make a resilient composite sandwich structure.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project encompasses the development of mycelium composite materials that are customizable for a broad range of markets including, but not limited to, automotive, transportation, architectural, biomedical, sports, and recreation. These materials are truly sustainable since both the laminates and cores consist of renewable materials.  These composites will also require significantly less energy to make than other biocompatible composites because the material is grown instead of synthesized, and the material is completely compostable at the end of life. The outcome of the proposed research and development will be a basic understanding of how to manufacture the composites, the range of material properties obtainable, and how to adjust material properties for particular markets. Through this project, we will partner with researchers and students at two local universities with known expertise in composites manufacturing and testing. If successful with mycelium composites, these materials will find applications in a very high-margin market (i.e. composites) that is sorely needing more sustainable innovations.

- abstractText: "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project seeks to
    further reduce the economic and environmental costs associated with sterilization
    of precursor materials for the Mycobond platform.  Mycobond is a revolutionary
    material that is grown from agricultural byproducts and a vegetative growth of
    a filamentous fungus (basidiomycete mycelium).  To ensure adequate growth all
    raw materials are either sterilized or pasteurized, which represents up to 24
    hours of process time and 50% of the material cost. This research intends to use
    an emulsion comprised of phenolic compounds from plant essential oils (PEOs) to
    inactivate competitive organisms on all feedstocks while reducing manufacturing
    costs. Preliminary trails have yielded favorable results, indicating a potential
    reduction of the disinfection costs by 88%.  Furthermore, this procedure can significantly
    reduce both the capital expense associated with production and the environmental
    footprint by removing high entropy processes.  Achieving successful disinfection
    with PEOs, and later inoculation with the desired mycelium, will allow the Mycobond?
    technology to retail at prices below those of expanded polystyrene (EPS), granting
    a competitive advantage that would aid in gaining rapid market adoption.  The
    technology benchmarks well against EPS, and has interested early adopters in the
    protective packaging and rigid board insulation industries. \n\nThe broader impact/commercial
    potential of this project is the development of sustainable, high-performance
    composite materials for the packaging and insulation industries.  10% of the petroleum
    imported into the United States is allocated to the production of inherently unsustainable
    materials. The Mycobond platform is a direct replacement for many these materials,
    applicable for products from protective packaging to structural cores. The use
    of a PEO emulsion seeks to further reduce the energy consumption of material production
    by closely emulating nature. The biological composites and related processes can
    reduce energy consumption fivefold and greenhouse gas emissions by tenfold when
    compared to an identical volume of EPS.  Furthermore, since the raw materials
    used are byproducts from American industries, a new revenue stream will result,
    bolstering local economies. The plants and related compounds utilized in the procedure
    are rapidly renewable and the proposed disinfection platform is an open system
    which reduces dependence on a solitary feedstock. The use of PEO emulsions to
    disinfect materials has value beyond composites production, and will find applications
    in agriculture industry and commercial cultivation of mushrooms.  The effective
    replacement of high-embodied energy processes will support local manufacturing
    by increasing the feasibility of low-cost, regional production."

- abstractText: |-
    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop an innovative, environmentally benign process for forming net shape products of superior quality and performance from dissimilar biomaterial components.  Plastics and foams are dependent upon inherently unsustainable raw materials, require a high embodied energy to produce, and do not readily biodegrade at the end of their useful lives.  This project will focus on the further development of an alternative material system: a self-assembling biocomposite which is literally grown in the dark using fungal tissue to bind heterogeneous particles of agricultural waste.  The biodegradable material exhibits mechanical properties that rival synthetic foams and offers the potential to transform the multi-billion dollar protective packaging and structural cores industries. However, the thin-walled plastic forms used to shape resulting products during growth have a limited service life and must be replaced frequently.  Removing or reducing dependence on these forms, through development of a gelatinizing growth substrate and process, will increase sustainability and yield, and reduce costs to further incentivize widespread adoption.  The proposed research will answer questions that will determine whether this gel-assisted casting process is technically and commercially feasible, and therefore laying the groundwork for a Phase II project.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is difficult to overstate.  Conventional methods of producing low-cost, high strength-to-weight ratio materials for protective packaging and building construction use up to 10% of the world's petroleum as feedstock and consume considerable energy in the production process. Mycological material technology eliminates the need for fossil fuel feedstock and currently requires only one-eighth of the energy to produce an equivalent volume as compared to synthetic foam. In addition, the products are non-toxic, fire-retardant, and readily biodegradable. The commercial potential is high, as products made of this material, as currently manufactured, already successfully compete in the marketplace with products made of expanded polystyrene and expanded polypropylene. The benefits to society at large include safer materials, the transition to regional manufacturing which will bolster local economies, the use of domestic byproducts as the primary raw material, lower energy consumption, and a production method which creates less waste and pollution. The successful completion of this project will help United States manufacturers to emerge as world leaders in the production and supply of sustainable materials, with the potential to serve numerous global markets.

- abstractText: |-
    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to further quantify the mechanical performance of mycological bio-composites that address the automotive and structural core industries, while concurrently scaling and demonstrating material production.  The engineered composites market continues to grow steadily because of the high strength-to-weight and stiffness-to-weight ratios of these systems, as compared to conventional engineering materials. Engineered woods are ubiquitous in the construction and furniture industries, but due to domestic indoor air quality regulations (Toxic Substances Control Act), these materials are being phased out or are forced to use expensive formaldehyde-free adhesives.  Similarly, the automotive industry is under regulatory pressure in Europe to find alternatives to fire-retardant foams that cannot be recycled due to inorganic filling agents.  The technical results from the Phase I effort have demonstrated bio-composite materials which can compete both economically, and on mechanical performance, with the aforementioned competitors, while meeting these legislative demands.  A preliminary cost analysis based on the process economics of our existing production facilities projects retail costs 45% and 35% below the current state-of-the-art in the automotive and furniture industries, respectively.  We will work with key industry partners to meet performance metrics and demonstrate quality pilot production.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project would be a customizable bio-composite for a broad range of markets, including automotive, transportation, architectural, furniture, sports, and recreation. These materials are truly sustainable, since both the laminates and cores used in the sandwich structure consist of renewable materials.  They also require significantly less energy to make than other biocompatible composites, because the material is grown instead of synthesized, and the material is completely compostable at the end of life. The outcome of the proposed development and demonstration will ensure that the bio-composite properties meet the requirements for the target markets.  Furthermore, over the course of this grant, and in cooperation with Rensselaer and Union College, we will demonstrate and scale the best manufacturing processes to a pilot stage capable of manufacturing high volumes of quality product.  Since these materials leverage regional lignocellulosic byproducts from domestic agriculture and industry, a regional manufacturing model is presently being pursued to reduce transportation and feedstock costs. This will not only bring additional value to U.S. agricultural markets, but will spur rural economic development through domestic manufacturing. Finally, these advanced biological materials represent a new paradigm in manufacturing, offering safe, biodegradable alternatives to traditional petroleum-based alternatives.

    Core Filler Materials in Sustainable Composites'
- abstractText: |-
    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to further develop, and demonstrate at scale, a biological disinfection process that has exhibited superior microbial inactivation to steam pasteurization at a lower cost. This process leverages dilute concentrations (0.5-0.875% by volume) of plant-derived phenols and aldehydes to inactivate lower level fungi and bacteria found on agricultural byproducts (seed husks and hulls). The application focus for this demonstration is a novel material technology that converts lignocellulosic waste into a high performance, low cost replacement for synthetics (plastics and foams) using a filamentous fungus. This biological disinfection process can reduce process energy consumption by 83% and system capital expense by upwards of 50%. This project will fully quantify the efficacy of this disinfection process at scale (production volumes) as well as analyze the integration of this technique into a mycological material production facility that is presently addressing the protective packaging industry. Batch and continuous systems will be explored, and a comprehensive economic model will be developed based on the results. The mycological materials that are produced under this demonstration will be compared with materials fabricated with the existing pasteurization system, and samples will be evaluated by customers to ensure product adoption.

    High-embodied energy disinfection processes, autoclave sterilization or pasteurization, are ubiquitous within industries such as agriculture, food processing, and biotechnology. These methodologies are implemented to reduce or remove background bioburden (bacteria, yeast, mold) that can be detrimental to downstream processes due to contamination. Mycological materials production represents such a process since raw material contamination results in product loss and added labor. The plant essential oil (PEO) disinfection technique was proven under the Phase I research to offer a comparable process time to steam pasteurization and superior disinfection efficacy; thus this technology could serve as a drop-in replacement in some industrial applications. This process minimizes capital equipment and operations costs due a reduction in system complexity and energy consumption. In regards to the production of mycological products, this disinfection process bolsters the process robustness by extending contaminate inactivation periods which promotes rapid mycelium colonization or a reduction in incubation time. Therefore new market opportunities for mycological materials can be addressed while further supporting the business case for regional manufacturing using domestic agricultural waste as raw materials. Finally, the benefits obtained from this novel disinfection process permit an accelerated deployment and development of turnkey production systems to displace synthetic materials.

  title: 'SBIR Phase I:  Automated and Self-Service Electronics Recycling Kiosk'
- abstractText: |-
    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)Phase II project is designed to commercialize a consumer self-serve, automated kiosk for the evaluation, buy back, and collection of used electronics directly from consumers.  Prototype kiosks deployed during Phase I provided convincing proof of the feasibility of the baseline technical approach to the visual and electrical inspection technology, robotics, and the market.  Financial metrics achieved were many multiples better than industry leading kiosks such as Coinstar or Redbox.  Further R&D is required to achieve enough reliability in the automated inspection systems and the kiosk hardware to lead to the permanent removal the kiosk attendants in field that currently serve as the fail-safe mechanism in the current prototype systems.  Broad commercial success relies on the development of a robust, designed-for-manufacturability (DFM), designed-for-serviceability (DFS), commercially reliable kiosk with a minimum retail field life of 5 years that incorporates needed improvements learned from Phase I including refinements to the visual inspection system and algorithms, electrical inspection system, test station robotics subsystems, ergonomics, GUI, and channel management systems.  ecoATM also hopes to further develop the system?s capability to offer personal data erasure and expand accepted device types to potentially include digital cameras, portable game players, printer cartridges, laptops, eReaders, and tablets.

    The broader impact of ecoATM?s patented system is that we finally achieved the threshold of consumer convenience and financial incentive required to inspire mass consumer participation in electronics recycling.  Our pilot market tests indicate that we harvested 20 times more used phones than the next closest competitor in the test areas.   As ecoATM scales nationally we will divert mass amounts of toxic eWaste from our landfills, and put huge sums of cash back in the hands of our customers and the retail locations hosting the kiosks, providing stimulus and incentive for these stakeholders to help forever alter the current wasteful lifecycle of consumer electronics.  On average, each ecoATM collects enough eWaste to offset its own annual energy consumption after just 5 days placement resulting in 360 days of CO2 offset.  An average ecoATM collects over 7,000 phones per year, which according to the EPA calculator is equivalent to taking the CO2 of 35 houses off the grid for a year.  National and global media have taken notice of ecoATM already and even the United Nation?s Low Carbon Leadership Program recognized ecoATM as one of the best ideas in the world for the reduction of CO2 on a global basis.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to address the significant technical barriers associated with an untethered overground cooperative gait rehabilitation exoskeleton. Current gait rehabilitation techniques available to patients with gait abnormalities include conventional therapist based rehabilitation and more recently Body Weight Support Treadmill (BWST) robotic rehabilitation. The leading BWST devices employ a cooperative gait rehabilitation approach that varies the assistance to the user based on their ability. The conventional therapy approach is extremely labor intensive, but while the BWST therapy is the leading alternative it has shown mixed results. Researchers hypothesize that this is due to differences in the trained gait between BWST walking and overground walking. Mobile exoskeletons have emerged to better imitate overground walking, but to date no mobile device has implemented a cooperative control strategy, mainly due to the technical issues associated with its use. This SBIR intends to develop novel advances in cooperative rehabilitation control strategies along with innovative actuator designs to make possible the first mobile overground gait rehabilitation exoskeleton that implements a cooperative strategy. Specifically, it will address the major technical barriers to achieving this goal to increase the chances of successfully developing this technology in Phase II.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project could directly impact the lives of patients with impaired gaits from a variety of symptoms including post-stroke, incomplete spinal cord injury, and multiple sclerosis. It is estimated that nearly 2 million patients in the U.S. could currently benefit from improved gait rehabilitation therapy. This technology can be sold directly to rehabilitation hospitals through existing distribution channels. This technology will have a significant impact on the lives of patients undergoing gait rehabilitation. It will enable a new level of effectiveness by providing a novel cooperative rehabilitation approach on an overground device. Existing conventional therapy often causes patients to transition to therapist-assisted overground walking prematurely, resulting in a gap in the progression of care. This device addresses that gap by supporting a patient from acute therapy until they are strong enough for therapist-assisted overground walking. Finally, this device will expand our technical understanding of the limits and effectiveness of robotic gait rehabilitation. The device will serve as a platform to develop the next generation of even more effective robotic rehabilitation control strategies, both for the investigators and the greater research community.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project seeks to create exoskeleton assist devices for workers in distribution centers and automobile assembly plants. By using these assistive devices, workers can dramatically reduce the load in the vertebrae of the lower back when maneuvering parts and boxes. Such collaboration between humans and machines has the benefit of the intellectual advantage of humans coupled with the strength advantage of machines. The proposed project involves the University of California at Berkeley as research partner, General Motors Corporation, and the U.S. Postal Service. The end goal is a reduction in back injuries in the workplace which are considered by OSHA the nation?s number one workplace safety problem.

    The broader impacts of this research are reduced worker?s compensation insurance costs, reduced disability payments, increased worker productivity, and the ability for workers to keep working into their older years; in short, improve worker quality of life. Furthermore, these new devices will open an entirely new market which will serve an important role in establishing the United States as the number one player in the emerging field of bionics. The potential impacts to worker safety and American quality of life are large and diverse.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I research project proposes the development of the design features, sensory system and the control algorithm of an integrated powered knee-ankle power regenerative prosthesis. Despite significant advances in lower limb prosthetics over the past decade, all presently commercially available lower limb prostheses incorporate passive ankle joints. That is, the joints of the prostheses can either store or dissipate energy, but cannot provide any net power over a gait cycle. The inability to deliver joint power significantly impairs the ability of these prostheses to restore many locomotive functions, including level walking, walking up stairs, walking up slopes, running, and jumping, all of which require significant net positive power at the knee joint, ankle joint, or both. The objective of this proposal is to investigate the use of integrated powered knee and ankle joints in transfemoral prostheses that use sensory information from the ground and the wearer. The hypothesis is that a prosthesis with actively powered knee and ankle joints will significantly enhance the mobility of transfemoral amputees while walking on level grounds, as well as stairs and slopes.

    The proposed work will result in new theoretical frameworks for both the control, sensory system, and design of such systems. Major intellectual contributions will include the design of power systems; development of the sensory system to obtain information from the ground and from the user; the development of a control framework for the interactive control of prostheses; and the development of adaptive and robust controllers for impedance modulation during locomotion. This project intends to create principles that provide significantly greater functional capabilities for above-knee amputees. Specifically, the proposed work will enable more natural, stable, and adaptable prostheses. These research elements in this proposal will also form a foundation for powered orthotic systems. Additional significant benefits of this work include fostering a broader awareness and increased sensitivity of young engineers and educational institutions to disability issues. Limb loss also affects a growing number of military personnel serving in recent conflicts, as well as a far larger number of veterans from previous wars.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project proposes to create an in-home gait training device that allows a post-stroke patient to undergo rehabilitation with little or no assistance. Approximately 500,000 Americans survive a stroke each year. Miraculously, most stroke survivors can relearn skills, such as walking, that are lost when part of the brain is damaged. They can relearn walking most effectively if they are aided in making the correct motions by a machine or a physical therapist while attempting to walk. This training is expensive and requires the patient to make regular visits to a stroke center or qualified physical therapy center. Berkeley Bionics proposes to create a lightweight robotic exoskeleton which cradles a patient?s lower extremities and torso, and maneuvers their rehabilitating limbs for them.

    The broader impacts of this research are immense. These devices could move most post-stroke rehabilitation out of the clinical setting thereby reducing labor costs dramatically. The gait training exoskeletons will be wearable, very unobtrusive, and allow patients to maneuver in the real world. Patients would therefore be able to wear such devices for most of the day, thus remaining mobile and gaining the therapeutic effects of physical therapy over the course of a day, rather than just a short session. Furthermore, creating such a device will also give clinicians an alternative to the wheelchair to assist patients who are unable to recover adequate mobility to function in their daily lives. This could potentially reduce unhealthy effects of wheelchair use for millions.
