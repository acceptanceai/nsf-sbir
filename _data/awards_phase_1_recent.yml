- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase I project focuses on the development and demonstration
    of a new high resolution X-ray detector to be utilized (initially) in medical
    diagnosis. The early work by NGS Detectors and collaborators has shown an improvement
    in resolution by a factor of almost 10 over the X-ray detectors in current use.
    The focus of this Phase I project is to now improve both the resolution and efficiency
    of the detector (in order to reduce the x-ray dose received by patients). The
    initial diagnostic application is for mammography, where the improved resolution
    is expected to allow accurate diagnosis of suspicious features in the breast at
    an early stage, while reducing the false diagnoses (both positive and negative)
    that are recognized to be problematic. The detectors have potential application
    in other medical diagnostics situations, such as neonatal and cardiovascular fields,
    where the higher resolution is expected to extend the application of X-ray diagnostics
    well beyond current practice. Applications for industrial nondestructive evaluation
    in fields such as semiconductor manufacturing are also envisaged. \n\nThis SBIR
    Phase I project focuses on the development and demonstration of a new high resolution
    X-ray scintillation detector. The indirect detector utilizes a new polymeric scintillating
    polymer developed by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories for security applications,
    and incorporates the material into an optical channel plate. The optical channel
    plate contains an ordered array of high quality capillaries (e.g. 10 micron diameter).
    The scintillating polymer absorbs X-rays, and emit photons that are channeled
    to pixels of an optical detector with minimal scattering. A resolution of 10 micron
    has already been demonstrated, an improvement of nearly an order of magnitude
    over both direct and indirect detectors in current use in medical diagnostics.
    The focus of Phase 1 is to complete the detector characterization, with a special
    emphasis on improving the detector efficiency in order to minimize X-ray dose
    rates for patients. The successful completion of Phase I will lead to a Phase
    II that demonstrates that the higher resolution indeed yields higher feature discrimination
    in realistic diagnostic situations.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission
    and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
    intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable a safer, more reliable, and more efficient electric power grid. The power grid is critical infrastructure on which all of America's economic sectors depend, and so its reliability and stability is of the utmost importance. The technology being developed is the ideal modeling and simulation platform to analyze and predict grid abnormalities and blackouts due to its unprecedented ability to simulate complex systems accurately. Its physics-based simulation engine can incorporate more detailed models of loads on the grid, thereby allowing system operators to better assess grid state and stability. The proposed technology is also uniquely capable of modeling distributed energy resources at the transmission and distribution scale, an industry need that has been deemed critical to increase the penetration of renewables on the grid. The technology has substantial potential for commercial impact, as there are thousands of transmission, distribution, generation, and consulting organizations that are potential customers. Combined, these factors can help enable a more robust, secure grid that operates with reduced cost and emissions. This Phase I project represents the first step in making this technology a commercial reality.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project represents a significant departure from traditional methods that are used to model the electric power grid. The team's foundational research has already shown that the technology can simulate the U.S. Eastern Interconnection (half of the U.S. transmission grid) from any initial condition to evaluate complex contingencies - capabilities that are not possible with existing tools. The current- and voltage-based formulation used in the model is more flexible than is used in traditional power systems simulation software, enabling more realistic physics- and/or measurement-based models for more accurate simulation results. The Phase I project includes developing a secure and robust cloud platform for the technology that supports parallelized grid analyses, with a full library of component models and an intuitive web-based interface. This will enable system operators, utilities, and consultants to improve their planning studies and operations by enabling more accurate simulations at a higher throughput than is possible with today's software. The work done in Phase I will serve as a foundation for future advancements in power grid modeling and simulation, including integrated transmission and distribution system analysis and statistical analysis to assess the impact of uncertainties on the grid.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The?broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is represented by the development of a company in a unique field of single crystal growth addressing needs in solid-state lasers. Single crystal growth represents a small and highly specialized, but absolutely essential, area of modern materials technology. Solid-state lasers are commercially vital because they are compact, durable, relatively inexpensive, and field deployable in many technologies. Single crystals are essential components to solid-state lasers and thereby represent significant commercial potential.  This project will enhance the skill set of specialty manufacturers of high quality single crystals for solid-state lasers. It represents an unmet commercial need in short wavelength solid-state lasers and also will expand the technological skill set of single crystal growers. This last point is especially important, as there is a serious lack of skills, technology and infrastructure in solid state laser production in this country, and this makes the US increasingly dependent on offshore suppliers of essential materials. This program will help train the next generation of critical materials manufacturing experts in the US.

    The proposed project intends to address the development of new single crystals called Strontium Beryllium Borate (SBBO). These crystals are an enabling technology for the manufacture of short wavelength solid-state lasers lasing at and below 266 nm. Such lasers have many potential applications but at present there are no materials capable of practical performance at these very short wavelengths. This shortcoming represents a significant commercial opportunity. The project will examine production of single crystals of a new material to meet this need using hydrothermal synthesis, which employs very hot water at high pressures as a growth environment. In this Phase I project, research will be undertaken to develop a growth protocol of large single crystals of this vital material, A feedstock will be perfected, and seed crystals will be produced. Transport conditions will be optimized, and suitable temperature gradients will be identified. Preliminary evaluation of crystal quality will be performed. Suitable crystals will be sent to collaborators in the laser manufacturing industry for preliminary production of solid-state short wavelength lasers. The seed crystals and growth protocols from the research in this Phase I program will be used in a Phase II project for development of a full-scale commercial manufacturing process for this crystal.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will be functional neuronal cells derived from human adult adipocytes that will have applications in regenerative medicine.  The goal is to develop dopaminergic (DA) neural progenitor cells (NPCs) from transdifferentiated human adult adipocytes using a DA cell induction cocktail.  This will have application in cellular therapeutics and research tools for Parkinson's Disease (PD), and other neuronal diseases. In addition, these studies will impact the field of stem cell research and regenerative medicine, since this will be the first demonstration that functional neuronal cells, the main building blocks of brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nervous systems, can be produced from mature fat cells that can be used as cellular therapeutics for several neurological disorders.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop new technology for generation of midbrain dopaminergic (DA) neural progenitor cells (NPCs) from adult adipocytes (fat cells), which will used as a platform to develop cellular therapeutics for Parkinson's Disease (PD), and PD research tools. Recently, using a chemical genetics approach (chemical approach or small molecule approach), engraftable midbrain DA neuronal progenitor cells (DA NPCs) from human bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-hMSCs) have been generated. Additionally, DA neuronal progenitor-like cells also had been produced from de-differentiated fat cells (DFAT cells) that have several advantages over BM-hMSCs such as homogeneity of DFAT cell cultures, ease of isolation and low immunogenicity. The goal of Phase I project is to validate and optimize the DA induction protocol for generation of midbrain DA NPC from DAFT cells. Phase II will focus on clinical grade manufacturing of these DA cells and testing their therapeutic effect in several preclinical animal models of PD. Commercial products emerging from Phase I/II work include cellular therapeutics for PD and research tools for PD.

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase I project entails the development of an EEG analysis
    software application that identifies the epileptogenic zone (EZ - where seizures
    start in brain) in medically refractory epilepsy (MRE) patients. Over 1 million
    people in the US have MRE, meaning that they do not respond to medication. MRE
    patients are frequently hospitalized, burdened by epilepsy-related disabilities,
    and contribute to 80% of the $16 billion dollars spent annually in the US treating
    epilepsy patients. There are 2 treatments: (i) surgical removal of the EZ, and
    (ii) neurostimulation, where the EZ is electrically stimulated to suppress seizures.
    Successful outcomes depend critically on accurately identifying the EZ from invasive
    EEG recordings, which is a long costly process, leading to grim outcomes where
    30%-70% of treated patients continue to have seizures. There has thus been an
    intensive search for an accurate data analytics tool to reduce time, risks and
    costs of invasive monitoring. This project involves further development of such
    a tool that generates visual \"heat\" maps from EEG data. The tool, grounded in
    dynamical systems theory and neuroengineering, has been validated with data from
    20 patients, achieving 95% accuracy in predicting surgical outcomes. Reducing
    monitoring time reduces the risk of infection from the brain being exposed, and
    reduces hospital costs associated with lengthy stays and clinical staff reviewing
    data. By providing more accurate definition of the EZ, the tool will also enable
    use of a precise and entirely new laser ablation procedure that makes tiny lesions
    in targeted structures as opposed to removing large portions of the brain. If
    successful, the tool will be closer to commercialization under a sustainable business
    model. Major EEG vendors and medical device companies are looking for accurate
    software applications in epilepsy treatment to enhance their product suites, and
    will be very interested in licensing the tool. \n\nThis Small Business Innovation
    Research Phase I project involves development of a cutting-edge EEG tool that
    uses dynamic network modeling and a highly innovative and patented theory of \"fragility\"
    of nodes in a dynamic network to localize the EZ from invasive EEG recordings,
    taking into account the extensive interconnection of neurons in the brain. The
    more \"fragile\" an EEG channel, the more likely it is in the EZ. Project aims
    are to (i) validate the tool on a large patient cohort, using invasive EEG data
    before, during and after seizure events; (i) test the tool?s efficacy using noninvasive
    scalp EEG recordings and (iii) design the user-interface and integrate this application
    into the existing clinical workflow to facilitate prospective studies. These milestones
    will minimize key risks in bringing this innovation to market, which are adoption,
    perceived liability, regulatory approval and reimbursement. Adoption risk will
    be mitigated if the tool is accurate, quick and easy-to-use, requiring essentially
    the push of a button to receive fragility maps. Accuracy risk will be mitigated
    if our completed retrospective study, including refinement of network models,
    shows comparable performance to our preliminary data. The quick and easy-to-use
    risks will be mitigated with the development of an intuitive interface that importantly
    integrates with the existing EEG data acquisition and visualization tools. Regulatory
    risk is low as a predicate device exists. Perceived liability of the tool in mis-diagnosis
    is a low risk as the tool is not intended to replace the clinician's analysis,
    but rather it provides an enhanced visualization of the EEG data (as demonstrated
    in our retrospective study) already being collected and analyzed in the clinical
    workflow. Finally, reimbursement risks will be mitigated if accurate identification
    of the EZ using the tool has the potential to significantly reduce or even eliminate
    the focal MRE segment reducing epilepsy-related costs by $6 billion/year. Consequently,
    healthcare and insurance providers will have a strong incentive to pay for, or
    reimburse epilepsy clinics for the tool.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory
    mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
    intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to optimize water utilization, thereby improving agricultural production. It is projected that the human population will exceed 9 billion by 2050.  To meet the expected demand, global food production must increase by more than 50% by 2050. This SBIR project will have impact not only in expanding fundamental knowledge of plant utilization of water but also in contributing to agricultural productivity, an urgent and practical need for human survival, in a sustainable manner.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to commercialize the advanced water-treatment technology that could enhance plant growth, and therefore improve crop output in agricultural applications. In short, a thin layer (about 100 microns, as thin as a human hair) of interfacial water was found to exist with a slightly higher pH, net negative charge, and a tendency to exclude impurities. These findings were similar to those found by other independent research groups working with xylem cells in plants and muscle cells in animals. Several hydrogels and polymers were also found to contain interfacial water with similar properties. Initial studies regarding the practical use of the interfacial water were conducted in a plant system. On average, initial results show a rapid growth rate of around 10% to 20% improvement compared to the control group; preliminary findings that have now been confirmed to be similar amongst four different plants, namely chick pea, wheatgrass, basil, and pea shoots. This SBIR will enable continued testing and scale up the interfacial water generator to meet water demands for customer validations.

    Research (SBIR) project is the introduction of an environmentally-beneficial filtration
    material and corresponding high performance, and long-lasting point-of-use water
    filter. The competitive advantages of the product are increased treatment efficiency,
    longer service life, and sustainable production at a  similar price point to commercial
    products. The biofabricated advanced media filter results in sophisticated material
    properties and higher consumer value at a lower overall cost. The success of this
    Phase I project has potential for far reaching commercial impacts beyond consumer
    water filtration. By demonstrating the consistency of the metal impregnated filter
    material, commercial applications could be extended to the fields of emissions
    control, energy storage, and chemical production. In each of these fields, including
    water filtration, the new filter material would be replacing unsustainable materials
    derived from coal and coconut. These existing materials have significant environmental
    impacts associated with their production and transportation. \n\nThis SBIR Phase
    I project proposed to use the efficiencies of biological organisms to produce
    high performance, economical, and sustainable materials for premium filtration
    applications. To achieve this goal, a biofabrication process has been developed
    that involves the controlled cultivation of fungi serving as a template for the
    production of advanced activated carbon. This bioprocess allows for precision
    control over the chemical and physical properties which can be easily customized
    for targeted applications. Using the process of bioaccumulation and biosorption,
    the fungi can be functionalized simultaneously with nitrogen heteroatoms and biogenic
    metals/metal oxide nanoparticles. These in-situ functionalities greatly improve
    material performance, extension of water filtration service life (2X over state-of-the-art),
    whilst reducing overall energy consumption during manufacturing. While this process
    has been demonstrated on the gram production basis, the technical hurdles in this
    Phase I include scaling production to the kilogram level, providing critical material
    validation testing, and prototyping of a final consumer product. To execute these
    goals, growth conditions will be optimized in scaled bioreactors, industrial testing
    methodology will be employed, and a simple, yet high value water filtration device

    are the leading cause of fatal injuries and the most common reason for trauma-related
    hospital admissions among older adults. One in every four Americans over age of
    65 falls each year, and the financial burden from the falls in the elderly is
    expected to reach $67B by 2020. Therefore, introduction of a smart insole might
    significantly reduce the financial burden for the Medical Care System. It will
    also allow the elderly population to achieve maximum independence in the activities
    of daily living. The proposed insole will also address the critical needs of the
    athletic shoe industry to reduce the incidents of ankle sprains. The development
    of the new smart balance?enhancing insole, which improves balance without irritation
    and habituation effects will likely lead to new fabrication techniques for manufacturing
    insoles. This SBIR innovation has the potential to introduce to the market a safe,
    reliable and cost-effective insole that could be easily manufactured and distributed.\n\n
    \ \nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a novel insole to facilitate
    proper and timely response to a person?s movements in order to maintain good balance
    while walking or standing. The plantar sole is a ?dynamometric map? of human balance
    control. The loss of balance occurs when the body weight is shifted too close
    to the plantar sole boundary. The timely information to the Central Nervous System
    (CNS) about such movements is critical for balance control. The proposed insert,
    with a system of microcells containing viscous fluid, triggers instantaneous rise
    of protrusions around the insole perimeter area in response to the sudden increase
    of pressure that excites the mechanoreceptors reporting to the CNS.  Such a balance-enhancing
    solution provides well-timed regional amplification of cutaneous mechanoreceptor
    sensitivity but without the side effects of the existing textured insoles. The
    shortcomings include permanent discomfort and irritation in the plantar sole,
    which results in desensitization of the sole somatosensory system. The main research

    This SBIR Phase I project intends to improve the outcomes of children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) by providing critical data from non-clinical settings that are currently unavailable to autism treatment providers. The project also focuses on accelerating the analysis of that data. It is estimated that the costs associated with ASD will be more than $2 million over a patient's life. However, studies have shown that the costs of lifetime care for a child diagnosed with ASD can be reduced by 2/3 with early intervention. Designing an appropriate treatment program, and then monitoring its efficacy, requires the collection of a range of data to avoid dependence on inference and anecdotes. Treatment providers often collect detailed data while working with an individual diagnosed with ASD, but they count on parents and caregivers to provide them with data regarding the child's progress outside the clinical setting. The data submitted are usually incomplete and inadequate (if submitted at all). This SBIR Phase I project will result in a prototype that will rapidly provide autism treatment providers with critical data and analysis, reducing the amount of time it takes to design an optimal treatment program, and thereby reducing the long-term costs associated with a diagnosis of ASD.


    This Phase I project will result in a prototype that will make the process of logging data almost frictionless for parents. That narrative data will be combined with video data, biometric data, and additional data collected passively from external sources. All the data will be merged, and then analyzed via machine learning to locate patterns and provide a complete picture to the child's behavior analyst. Developing a camera that will be unobtrusive enough for a child with ASD to tolerate will present a challenge, as will developing the associated software to tag items within the camera's view and save only relevant clips (such as the times immediately before, during and after a meltdown). It will also be challenging to develop a wearable device that a child with ASD will tolerate, along with the associated sensors and software to track metrics associated with arousal and stress. The most significant technical challenge, however, will be to develop the software that combines the multiple data streams and outputs a standardized ABC report (Antecedent, Behavior, Consequence) that would be judged as high quality by a Board Certified Behavior Analyst.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project will be the development of a detection assay to reduce the incidence of Vibrio-related infections. Infections from Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Vibrio vulnificus are the leading causes of seafood-borne infections and fatalities, respectively, and stem primarily from raw oysters. Development and implementation of rapid, accurate, inexpensive and easy-to-use testing methods would expand Vibrio data collection and enhance preventive measures by state shellfish labs (monitor harvest areas), and oyster processors and post-harvest processors (quality control at facilities). The assays will be available to users in simple, ready-to-prepare kits. These kits will make it easy for non-specialized personnel to test oyster lots still under refrigeration without disrupting logistics, and help U.S. oyster processors and post-harvest processors improve risk management tools and access export markets with restrictions on Vibrio levels. The tests also will improve environmental risk evaluations for harvest areas by state shellfish labs, FDA, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and other members of the National Shellfish Sanitation Program. The tests will be marketed in the U.S., and other large oyster producing nations.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to develop two-phase, thermostable test tube media formulations for the detection and enumeration of pathogenic V. parahaemolyticus, total V. parahaemolyticus, and V. vulnificus in oysters. The goal is to demonstrate a) > 95% sensitivity and specificity of each test with pure cultures and oyster samples; b) 24-hr detection time; c) ease-of-use of the ready-to-prepare kits, based on time, steps, equipment, materials and feedback from industry; and d) low cost. The main technical hurdles are: 1) Increasing formulation volumes for test tube assays since linear increases of agar layer volumes in test tube media formulations could impact Vibrio organism motility, and consequently detection speed and accuracy; and 2) replacing a non-heat stable antibiotic component, Polymixin B of the V. vulnificus test, with a heat stable alternative, like ampicillin or lincomycin, to improve ease-of-use.

    Transfer (STTR) project is the reduction of significant disease flare-ups in patients
    with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), increase in patient quality-of-life,
    and a reduction of expensive and unnecessary healthcare utilization. Current at-home
    care support for COPD patients is often completely missing or consists of action
    plans that fail to provide effective, individualized care. The alternative solution
    under development in this project is an easy-to use, personalized mobile application
    that catches disease degeneration early, tracks patient health history, and provides
    decision support to guide patients to the right medical care at the right time.
    COPD is one of the leading chronic conditions driving potentially avoidable hospital
    admissions. Pairing a mobile health management app with a smart triage system
    that provides instant healthcare guidance has the potential to dramatically reduce
    unnecessary COPD hospitalization and provide long-term maintenance treatment of
    COPD symptoms. Moreover, an easily accessible, highly accurate, convenient solution
    can empower patients to make better health decisions early. \n\nThis STTR Phase
    I project proposes to demonstrate positive impact and adoption of a mobile triage
    application for COPD patients. To date, a set of triage algorithms has been built
    and validated on simulated patient cases. The algorithms exhibited performance
    that is comparable to or better than a panel of board-certified pulmonologists.
    The next vital step is to establish the technical feasibility of a packaged, stand-alone
    mobile application. This research will focus on developing a fully featured prototype
    that is optimized for adoption, retention, and efficacy. A mix of user feedback
    and rigorous usage analysis collected through human testing will provide necessary
    insights on barriers to use, missing functionality, and consumer value. Standardized
    markers of health safety, symptom escalations, and patient quality-of-life will
    be used as metrics of product performance. Moreover, all data and conclusions
    will be subjected to peer review through publication and public presentations.
    As an additional objective, the accuracy of the algorithmic triage recommendations
    will be tested on real patient cases to further validate their accuracy and effectiveness.
    The anticipated result of the phase I procedure is demonstration that the app
    is safe (objective 1), operationally sound and optimal (phase 2), and valuable
    to consumers (objective 3).\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
    has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual

    is a sustainable fruit and vegetable processing technology utilizing a new, low
    temperature technique that can extend the shelf life of pre-cut fruits and vegetables
    by months without using preservatives, chemicals, freezing, or refrigeration.
    \ The technology would enable: all-natural, shelf stable fruit and vegetable products
    that retain maximum nutritional value, texture, and taste.  With significant percentages
    of the total US national energy budget used for food-related energy, and high
    fresh produce loss in the developed countries due to insufficient refrigeration,
    achieving shelf life extension without cold storage or preservatives could drastically
    reduce energy costs, increase efficiency, and expand access to nutrition globally.
    \n\nThis STTR Phase I project proposes to develop, validate, and build-upon initial
    research to evaluate the feasibility and scope of a novel food processing technology.
    Traditional processing methodologies have fundamental drawbacks.  High temperature
    treatments degrade nutritional quality while altering texture and taste of end-products.
    Freezing negatively affects the reconstitution properties of fruits and vegetables,
    and requires high energy consumption throughout the food system to maintain the
    cold chain.  HPP (high pressure processing) has limitations on the enzymes it
    can inactivate, and chemical alterations from high pressure treatment negatively
    affects texture and taste.  This research proposal will use validation studies
    to evaluate the feasibility and applicability of the novel processing technique
    to a variety of fruits and vegetables.  Successful experimentation will prove
    that the application of dense phase gas at low temperatures can overcome the aforementioned
    drawbacks, achieving enzymatic inactivation, destruction of the spores, improved
    reconstitution properties, lower energy requirements, and minimal deterioration
    of taste, texture, and nutritional quality.  Such a result would actuate follow-on
    development work to validate that, at commercial scale, the new process technology
    improves upon the operational costs of traditional methodologies.\n\nThis award

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will result from the development of a scalable, enterprise-ready conversational AI platform that enables businesses to automate customer support requests, optimize call routing efforts to get customers to the right human support agent, generate customer self-service resources like smart FAQs, augment human staff with bot capabilities, and enable personalized recommendations to support sales and purchasing decisions for customers. Such technology is beneficial to any enterprise organization, B2C (business-to-consumer) and B2B (business-to-business), who needs to communicate to customers, employees, and the public. With rising customer service and communication costs, automation is critical for businesses to maintain profitability and competitive advantages. On a societal level, conversational interfaces democratize access to information and resources worldwide. A significant portion of the world's population lives in regions where internet access is poor and device ownership is rare. Many also suffer from physical limitations, such as impaired vision or limited motor control. Accelerating technology access through conversational interfaces such as SMS and voice has already been shown to transform quality of life for disadvantaged groups through applications in telemedicine, personal finance, and education.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to enable human-level conversational ability in machines. Teaching computers to communicate like humans is a critical step to achieving human-level machine intelligence (HLMI), also called artificial general intelligence (AGI). Current state-of-the-art approaches to automated dialog systems use a combination of supervised learning and reinforcement learning implemented with deep neural network architectures. These approaches have shown promise on toy problems in academic research, but have mixed performance in enterprise settings. This Phase 1 project extends current deep learning approaches by developing a repeatable methodology for annotating and preparing enterprise data for use in dialog systems and a scalable, grounded neural network architecture that can reference external knowledge sources with minimal manual engineering.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to transform 2-way, mobile satellite communications from a niche service (affordable to less than 0.1% of the world?s people), to a broadly accessible mass market product (at costs well under $1/month).  Communications devices (that could be as small as vehicle key fobs) will communicate modest volumes of data to and from virtually anywhere on Earth.   The number of potential applications is large, with the following being a few examples:  every lifejacket on every commercial aircraft and cruise ship could transmit its location and status (in the event of a mishap); children and the elderly could be tracked globally; and drivers could be assured of assistance wherever they travel.   Secondary impacts would include an increase in average fuel efficiency when, for example, more vehicles are sold without spare tires (as drivers have more peace-of-mind regarding the possibility of being stranded).   The United States will benefit in terms of improved safety, conserved resources, stimulus to the satellite and related industries, and increased export revenues.

    The proposed project centers around a combination of innovations that exploit inherent (but previously unutilized) capabilities of existing satellites.  Currently operational Mobile Satellite Systems have communications architectures that do not lend themselves to low-cost transmission of small volumes of data.  By starting with a blank sheet of paper and rethinking the architecture, costs can be reduced by orders of magnitude (for both the communications devices and the data service).  The cost reduction of the terminal devices is primarily driven by lower data rates (with associated lower power and size).  While most technical aspects of communications links improve with lower data rates, one characteristic emerges as a constraint on the extent to which data rate can be reduced.  The purpose of this research is to study this characteristic, called phase noise, and its impact on the communications performance at low data rates when using real satellite links.  The results of this research will be quantitative conclusions regarding the trades between data rates, the cost impact of lowering phase noise in the communication elements, transmission performance, and the modem architectural options.  This study will enable optimization of this trade when developing the follow-on commercial products.

    This SBIR Phase I project seeks to commercialize a suite of gaze-driven training games that are designed to train attention orienting, focus, and inhibitory control. These video games are played with one's eyes, instead of a mouse or a touchscreen. By combining the gaze-driven aspect with embedded training principles, the games are uniquely effective in training attention. Attention is a foundational cognitive skill that is essential for academic success, much like reading is foundational to learning other subjects. The proposed project will result in a stand-alone system for elementary and middle schools to use in both special education and standard education programs for training attention control in children with attentional focus challenges. This product is particularly applicable for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and those with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), because their academic performance suffers from their attentional challenges. A key technical innovation for this project is the development of a suite of assessments that provide feedback on student performance on par with validated laboratory assessments of attention. The in-game assessments will be validated against the laboratory standards. At the end of this project, the suite of intervention and assessment games will be ready to deploy for testing in school settings as part of a SBIR Phase II project.


    Attention skill lies at the foundation of cognitive control and one's ability to scaffold successful classroom learning, yet existing laboratory tools to accurately measure attention's many facets are out of reach of the teachers and educators on the frontlines. This SBIR Phase I project brings innovation to the standard methods of attention assessment by creating easy to use assessment tasks that attract the attention of school children and whose validity will be compared to gold-standard lab assessments. This will make accurate assessment of attentional function more reliable even when delivered without an assessment expert present, and this project opens the market for attention training games that can show unbiased, quantitative improvement. This innovation will be broadly useful to allow a wide range of individuals to assess attention, but this specific project seeks to commercialize lab-quality attention intervention games for use by educators in schools with a software suite featuring interleaved assessment and training. This approach will provide feedback for school staff as well as ensure that the next steps in attention training are appropriate for the learner's current skill.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to establish faster, less expensive, more accurate ways of determining the contents of biological samples leading to novel medical diagnostics, new drugs, and other new products beyond the reach of the current scientific methods that employ mass spectrometry. The project will develop technology that enables better software for mass spectrometry, and will make mass spectrometry-based sample analysis more accessible to a broader segment of academic and industrial scientists, disrupting a $100M market. Advanced software is required to transform raw experimental data into the lists of molecules and quantities needed to create new drugs, discover diseases and increase food production. The successful completion of the aims of this proposal will enable the development of software built for the next generation of mass spectrometry, providing user-friendly, fast cloud software built on advanced, high-information algorithms.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop novel, high-information software technology for mass spectrometry data processing. The proposed work in Phase I will provide proof-of-concept for prototype development and testing in Phase II. The research will address three critical technical hurdles that are prerequisites to prototype development: 1) A mass spectrometry data storage and retrieval architecture sufficient to handle significantly more information from the hundreds of files in a typical study, 2) cloud-optimized versions of mass spectrometry information extraction algorithms, and 3) a cloud-based model-view controller framework that overcomes web-specific challenges for mass spectrometry data processing. The goal is to allow more experiments in the same amount of time without increasing costs, identifying more molecules than existing methods from the same experiment, and detecting molecules that are less abundant and go undetected by current methods.

    the challenges, inefficiencies and need associated with a rapidly growing precision
    glass optics market. Glass optics are currently used in a wide range of applications
    such as medical devices (scopes, diagnostics, imaging, etc.), defense (ballistic
    windows, missile domes, etc.), consumer electronics (cell phone lenses, smart
    device screens, etc.) and more. The challenge associated with this market is the
    constant need to prototype optical glass lenses during the development phase.
    Today, these glass lenses are prototyped using a combination of grinding and polishing
    processes that are costly and time consuming. The proposed (QET) Quad Element
    Technology could disrupt the glass optics industry, primarily the prototyping
    market estimated at about $300M with a rapid growth of 50% per year. The end result
    would be the much quicker availability of cutting edge technology that utilizes
    glass optics. An example would be significantly improving the arthroscopic or
    endoscopic surgical tools that drastically minimizes patient trauma and recovery
    time during a surgical procedure or even enabling remote surgery for patients
    especially in third world countries. Other societal benefits will be directly
    realized through economic growth, providing a competitive edge, and improving
    product quality and profitability.             \n\nThe intellectual merit of this
    project is to enable an innovative high productivity approach to manufacturing
    optical quality glass. The objective of this proposal is to demonstrate proof
    of concept and determine the feasibility of combining four (4) distinct elements
    in a single machining process: mechanical, chemical, photonic and thermal. The
    proposed technology, termed QET (Quad Element Technology), is the first of its
    kind in machining processes to exploit the advantages of the four elements specifically
    for material removal. Till date, these four elements have been used consecutively
    in status quo machining processes but never concurrently. The ability of extracting
    and optimizing only the advantages of these four elements will enable a faster
    (6-8x) and cheaper (3-5x) precision manufacturing process to produce glass optics.
    The primary goal of the Phase I R&D is to successfully select and optimize individual
    components for each of the four elements proposed and demonstrate a precision
    turning process on optical glass.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission

    Research (SBIR) project is the reduction of the cost of wind energy through a
    robust, inexpensive, and efficient vertical-axis wind turbine (VAWT). This project
    has the potential to increase global wind power production through technological
    advancements that lower installation, operations, and maintenance costs via an
    innovative design which addresses reliability and efficiency concerns that have
    previously limited the penetration of VAWTs into the wind energy market. Compared
    to the common horizontal-axis wind turbine (HAWT), the proposed technology requires
    an order of magnitude fewer components. Additionally, heavy and maintenance intensive
    components are located at ground level for ease of access. One initial market
    for this technology will be stand-alone, small-scale generation, where this technology
    will provide long-lasting, low-maintenance power for remote locations. Another
    initial market is the repowering and augmentation of existing wind turbine arrays.
    Here, this technology will be a cost effective method of revitalizing underperforming
    or aging HAWT farms. The long-term objective is large-scale, VAWT-only arrays.
    Recent scientific advances indicate that, unlike HAWTs, interactions between VAWTs
    can be beneficial, resulting in cost-effective, high-output wind farms. \n\nThis
    SBIR Phase I project proposes to address the reliability and efficiency concerns
    that have previously limited the penetration of VAWTs into the wind energy market.
    XFlow Energy's novel design utilizes a robust, stationary central shaft extending
    the length of the rotor, reducing harmful loading to the rotor structure. This
    design requires a larger central shaft than VAWTs tested to date, and the impact
    of a large central shaft on VAWT power output has not been previously investigated.
    Laboratory-scale tests will be performed on a range of geometries to analyze the
    fluid-dynamic impact of larger central shafts and the resulting changes in turbine
    performance and loading. This information will inform the design and structural
    simulation of a 500 W turbine.  This design will be prototyped and will undergo
    thorough performance measurements. Ultimately destructive testing will be performed
    to identify structural deficiencies, and the design updated appropriately. The
    objective of SBIR Phase I is to produce a 500 W turbine that is thoroughly characterized,
    can survive up to 100 mph winds, and is ready for commercialization. This design
    will inform development of a utility-scale turbine (>50 kW) which will be the
    focus of SBIR Phase II.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will investigate the use of novel photo-switchable adhesives in medical dressings to improve patient safety, hospital compliance and potentially change the standard of care in the field of adhesive dressings. The proposed work differs drastically from other research endeavors to create dismantlable adhesives, whose drawbacks include high costs, difficulty to scale, biocompatibility issues, and inability to effect switching in application within short times. This new research offers advantages of significantly lower costs and easier scale-up using readily available adhesive industry infrastructure. Medical adhesive dressings that easily lose peel adhesion addresses a significant unmet need for preventing medical adhesive related skin injuries (MARSI), a prevalent but under-recognized injury that affects 7% of all patients across all age groups and healthcare settings. MARSI causes about 1.5 million injuries annually in the US alone and it is estimated that MARSI caused $850M in payments withheld to hospitals due to low patient satisfaction. This project is pursing the creation of a medical dressing that addresses these concerns while being cost competitive, easy to use and most importantly, safe to the patient's skin. Prototype medical dressings will be characterized and tested based on customer requirements.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project presents a novel adhesive technology platform where use-case characteristics at application are decoupled from end of life/removal characteristics through photo-switching. Photo-switchable medical adhesive dressings that lose peel adhesion upon application of light address a significant unmet need for preventing medical adhesive related skin injuries (MARSI), a prevalent but under-recognized injury that affects 7% of all patients across all age groups and healthcare settings. The proposed work differs drastically from other research endeavors to create dismantlable adhesives as the proprietary photo-switchable molecules enable change in human safe conditions and in short time frames. The proposed Phase 1 SBIR project would evaluate different proprietary multifunctional crosslinkers to increase the speed of the photo-switch by about 50% to meet clinician needs. This would be followed by experimentally evaluating methodologies to fabricate adhesive lined films for optimal optical switchability at different thicknesses and for different substrates. Finally, the learnings from the above two steps about adhesive coated films will be combined with an existing skincare lamp to demonstrate proof of product. Product performance will be characterized and tested to optimize performance based on customer requirements.

    This SBIR Phase I project will develop an innovative 3D medical imaging technology for early-stage detection and analysis of cancers, initially focusing on detecting pre-cancer cervical lesions. This project will advance from creatively assembling existing active optics hardware to inventing a new microfiber-based active optics system to circumvent limits of space confinement and 3D resolution. The project's fundamental strategy for identifying pre-cancers of the cervix, which relies on a macroscopic 3D digital analysis combined with microscopic cell evaluation, is naturally amenable to artificial intelligence technologies. The versatility of this imaging platform enables the resolving of medical diagnostic challenges in wealthy settings and the resolving of cost-saving barriers in resource-limited settings. The imaging technology can be extended beyond medical practice to other scientific and industrial disciplines. Potentially, this project has an immediate impact on saving lives and costs via the early detection of fatal diseases. Additionally, the data and knowledge acquired developing and implementing this imaging system provide opportunities to meaningfully develop new computational strategies for educational, engineering and industrial interests. The innovative, commercially viable, platform technology offers opportunities for significant, tax-revenue-generating global profits, for future technology application spin-offs, and for producing high technology jobs for U.S. citizens.

    The project innovation will voyage from state-of-the-art 3D software development to the creation of a new type of fiber bundle imager with an electronically controlled actively focusing lens. Combined, these tasks achieve the creation of a miniaturized 3D imaging system capable of navigating confined spaces within the body, such as inside the cervix opening. For all prototypes developed for this project, final 3D renderings are enabled by proprietary 3D rendering software, capable of quantifying tissue color, volume and shape at the macroscopic level, while also evaluating cell size and approximate shape at the microscopic level. In wealthy settings, this system would be desirable for implementing a single-phase cervical cancer screening strategy to replace the current two-phase approach, which requires Pap smear and/or human papilloma virus assay, followed by the more expensive colposcopy in the case of an abnormal result. In resource-limited regions and/or regions with difficult-to-reach populations, where it is challenging to get patients to return for a follow-up visit, the technology would offer a low-cost, pre-screening method that only requires a single visit. This 3D imaging system could be combined in the future with a therapeutic agent administered at the time of diagnosis, thus offering a single-visit, screen-diagnose-and-treat method.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is the development of a cost-effective, environmental and economically sound Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) production facility based on a finite number of horseshoe crabs (HSC) using minimally impactful and novel bleeding procedures.  The goal is to address the demands of an estimated $114 million LAL market and finished kit market in excess of $1 billion per annum. Success of this project also anticipates exceeding current standards by ensuring biomedical and pharmaceutical manufacturing compliance with fewer total horseshoe crabs than the number that die annually from current practices. New approaches to HSC bleeding developed in this project would also enable repeated, controlled bleeding while maintaining optimal conditions for animal vitality and for the adjacent communities. Assuming optimized, scalable HSC bleeding operations could eventually expand current supplies, innovative applications could be developed. For example, early detection of sepsis could help avert some $30 billion in direct care every year in the US, notwithstanding the potential to save countless lives with development of gram-negative screening tools for hospital acquired septicemia.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop an alternative method of bleeding horseshoe crabs (HSCs) for Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) harvest. The overarching objective to demonstrate the proof-of-concept of an implantable, and surgical-grade device engineered to facilitate routine bleeding, without compromising the integrity and well-being of the HSC. This will be achieved via a systematic study of HSC bleeding outcomes to investigate whether such a device can meet the sterility and quality standards of traditional approaches, while obviating the need for extraneous transport to expensive, inland bleeding facilities. Furthermore, the commercial opportunity and feasibility of the device paired with a habitat-based, enclosed system to systematically monitor HSC wellbeing will be investigated. This SBIR Phase I project would be the first to investigate an alternative approach to bleeding HSCs, a technique that has not changed significantly since the late 1800's. At scale, the proposed approach would also be expected to improve product quality and traceability, and ultimately the bottom line of companies producing LAL kits, given a surplus of LAL in the supply chain.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to make non-pharmacological treatment of depression accessible to all patients. According to the World Health Organization, 350 million individuals are affected by depression. In the United States, depression affects 16 million people and it costs $210 billion a year in lost productivity and care for the illnesses related to the disease. Antidepressant drugs are coupled with negative side effects and they are ineffective in 30% of the cases. Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) is an FDA approved non-invasive method for depression therapy that consists in the administration of short electromagnetic pulses on patient?s scalp to stimulate regions of the brain involved in mood control. This SBIR Phase I project will help the generation of a new rTMS system that will improve outcomes of depression treatment by stimulating deeper brain cells and reducing the incidence of pain and discomfort associated with current rTMS therapy. The new device will allow broad distribution of rTMS based therapy for both professional clinicians and, in the future, home-care settings. It will avoid reliance on drugs to people affected by depression and it will reduce the impact of depression on society.

    The SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop and demonstrate the efficacy a new wearable rTMS stimulator device. Although rTMS has a 75% success ratio on depressed patients, 40% of subjects report pain, headaches and discomfort during therapy with current rTMS systems, resulting in a high dropout rate. This is mainly due to poor localization of electromagnetic pulses with commercially available rTMS devices. The new system will combine a new technology that stimulates the brain?s deepest regions involved in depression with unprecedented precision and a new protective shield designed to ward off unwanted heat away from the head, reducing scalp pain and discomfort. The project will develop and validate the efficacy of these components and their integration into a wearable helmet. The project will also demonstrate the superiority of the new device over current gold standard rTMS solutions. The company expects that this research will lead to the generation of a new device capable of treating depression patients through precise stimulation reducing over 40% the unwanted heat, thereby preventing headache and scalp discomfort.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project include development of a commercial proof-of-concept percutaneous directional microwave ablation (MWA) applicator which may provide medical practitioners a new approach for treating cancer. In clinical use, a directional MWA applicator will facilitate both procedural and technical simplification of MWA treatments, saving time and critical resources in hospitals, and ultimately improve quality of, and access to, cancer treatment for a broad range of patients. The research and development proposed in this project will enhance scientific and technological understanding of miniaturized MWA antennas capable of radiating with directional patterns. Specifically, special materials to reduce required antenna dimension and increase efficiency, and advanced antenna designs to maximize the size of directional ablation zones will be studied during this project. Commercial development of the proposed technical advances could expand their use for the treatment of other medical conditions or for applications in other industries such as wireless communications. This STTR Phase I project will contribute to the creation of technology jobs in Kansas, a region where there are few medical or technology companies.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to develop a commercial proof-of-concept directional microwave ablation (MWA) applicator. MWA procedures offer cost-effective, minimally-invasive treatment options for localized tumors and other disease. These treatments are especially important to the large population of cancer patients who are poor candidates for surgery or other physically demanding therapies. However, currently available MWA systems employ applicators with omni-directional radiation patterns, which if not placed precisely may damage critical healthy tissues or result in disease recurrence. A directional MWA applicator can facilitate technical and procedural simplifications which to alleviate these current challenges. We will investigate: (1) alternative materials to shrink antenna cross-section and (2) novel antenna geometries to maximize the size of directional microwave ablation zones. We will employ an approach integrating multiphysics computational models, benchtop experimentation in ex vivo tissue, and experiments in animal models in vivo to design, optimize, and validate our device. Our anticipated technical results are the development of a MWA applicator that provides directional control of radiation pattern that can ablate to depths of greater than 30 mm, creating an ablation volume comparable to current clinical non-directional devices.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is an inexpensive handheld smartphone device for rapid detection of the toxigenic cholera pathogen in environmental water sources. Contaminated water sources place populations at risk for contracting cholera. Once contracting the disease, patients with cholera exhibit symptoms of diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration and, if left untreated, ultimately death. Wide-scale cholera outbreaks devastated Haiti in 2010 and Yemen in 2017, affecting over one million total individuals. Currently, methods used to detect the cholera pathogen in water involves a 3 to 5-day water collection and cell culture procedure. This project proposes a portable smartphone platform used to detect the cholera pathogen, Vibrio cholerae, in under 30 minutes at the water source. Smartphone connectivity, will also enable geomapped and time-stamped detection results. This novel and proactive approach for detection can enable organizations to remediate water sources prior to communities contracting and spreading cholera. Downstream, this technology will save the time and costs currently associated with cholera outbreaks and can be expanded to other infectious diseases.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a rapid, cost-effective, and robust smartphone platform to detect Vibrio cholerae and automate the detection result at an environmental water source. The device performs isothermal DNA amplification assay combined with the novel sensing approach, particle diffusometry. This project proposes to characterize the specificity, sensitivity, and lower limit of detection of Vibrio cholerae detection on the smartphone platform. The detection results will be compared against current gold-standard quantitative DNA amplification methods. Further, a reagent storage method involving freeze drying will be used to eliminate the need for cold-chain storage. We will assess the long-term stability of our assay reagents through accelerated aging studies. Lastly, a low powered integrated heating unit will be designed to perform the isothermal DNA amplification assays in the handheld device. At the completion of this Phase I project, an integrated smartphone platform will be ready for field testing.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to enable smaller businesses to participate to the chatbot revolution, by making it easier to design and deploy chatbots. The initial focus of this project is healthcare, where there is great opportunity to improve the quality and availability of patient services. The key technological innovation is the facilitation of an ecosystem of chatbot designers and agents, through the creation of novel chatbot design, collaboration and deployment tools.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will create the technology to allow chatbot designers to incorporate human agents into the logical flow of chatbots. Currently, chatbots are designed in an ad-hoc trial-and-error manner, which is infeasible for small businesses who do not have the resources to constantly refine and evaluate their chatbots. The project will also create techniques to allow human agents to be productive when taking over chatbot sessions, and allow designers to improve the logical flow of chatbots based on usage data.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is that it will save billions of dollars by anticipating construction delays and streamlining coordination to prevent them. Lower costs will help upgrade our nation's infrastructure, which is a critical national priority. Many construction companies strongly want a solution to indoor progress monitoring. Laser scanning is too expensive and slow, and photography services can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars for large projects and introduce logistical challenges. The proposed research would simplify the workflow for progress monitoring of interiors by automatically registering 360 degree photos and video and aligning them to building information models (BIM), providing a cheap, quick, and effective solution for daily progress monitoring.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to localize images, reconstruct 3D models, align them to floorplans or 3D BIM, and use the aligned models to provide actionable data to construction managers. A main challenge is to robustly solve for camera pose using structure-from-motion in indoor scenes that are unfinished and contain textureless and reflective surfaces. A second challenge is to automatically or semi-automatically register the models to 2D or 3D plans, made more difficult by the fact that the site is incomplete and constantly changing. A third challenge is to create interfaces that project personnel can use to perform visual inspection, progress monitoring, requests for information, and other supervision and coordination tasks. The project will investigate the use of tags (i.e., markers) to improve robustness of 3D reconstruction and to perform registration without requiring the 3D positions of tags to be known in advance. Thus, the project addresses major unsolved problems in computer vision, robotics, and their application to construction management.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable more efficient access to information, goods, and services from organizations and businesses through conversational interfaces. With an estimated 33 million voice-activated devices installed in the U.S. by the end of 2017, consumers are beginning to see the benefits of the rise in business services on these devices. Interacting with computers in natural language is more efficient than ever before, and business are urgently seeking to include their services on this new modality. Yet, while advances in machine learning have increased the speed and accuracy with which conversational interfaces are built, today's solutions still result in major bottlenecks in the development process. Addressing these bottlenecks would result in significant savings of time and resources for businesses, in addition to increased convenience for end users.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project advances the development of machine learning and natural language processing technologies that will enable rapid creation of conversational interfaces and increase the efficiency with which individuals interact with computers. Despite major recent advances in conversational interface tooling, current bottlenecks in building robust conversational interfaces still exist, as portions of the development process go from highly-automated to manually-programmed. Instead, the proposed approach will achieve end-to-end automation using an innovative LSTM sequence-to-sequence machine learning model to learn and simulate human behavior on a web page, as well as a new system for open-domain question answering.

    This SBIR Phase I project will create a novel educational product by pairing VR/360 video with impact measurement software and interactive social engagement tools to simulate true-to-life experiences that enable users to gain personal insight into pressing social issues and then take action to solve them. Installed either as a multisensory 'empathy exhibition' or used in a classroom setting, participants embark on a transformative learning journey which builds empathy and critical understanding about a social issue and those affected by it, then connects them to concrete opportunities to make social change. Users begin as uniformed participants, and through the proposed process emerge as changemakers engaged in solving social problems. Experiential learning has long been an empathy building discipline outside the mediated experience, yet it is encumbered by barriers of cost, safety, distance, time and access that limit participation. Transformation360 will use technology to render experiential learning programs virtually anywhere. The result will be a revolutionary new way to move the public from apathy to action on a limitless number of social issues. Transformation360 will provide nonprofits, governments, and institutions working to solve social problems with a powerful social engagement tool that creates actively engaged citizens, consumers, volunteers, supporters, and social entrepreneurs to address the world's most pressing social problems.


    This SBIR Phase I project will develop a VR/360 video hybridization that will allow users interactive choices within a conventional three-degree-of-freedom 360 Video experience. Currently only VR's computer-generated imaging can provide a significant choice landscape for users. By using 360/3D photography, unique game engine software and multi-scenario video capture in the field the project will give users a new level of choice options for a photo documentary experiences. The efficacy of this technology for building empathy will be quantified through audience testing. Also, cinematic techniques such as mise-en-cine and montage, not currently used in most 360 video projects, will also be tested against audience reactions. These video production and consumption technologies and techniques will also be cross-tested against experience learning processes such as the breaking down assumptions, peer learning, debriefing, uncertainty, and risk. Potential adverse side effects to VR/360 video will also be addressed. The project will rely heavily on the engagement measurement and data visualization tool Harvis to test and analyze audience reactions to these experiments.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is that it will enable small and mid-size robotics and industrial vehicle manufacturers to rapidly deploy computer vision and machine learning in their products and make their machines competitive in the global market place. The project will create a multi-vendor real-time vision stack for industrial machines that enables multiple types of machines to be developed using a uniform software interface. Combined with an app store model, such interfaces will enable a developer community to create application-specific solutions with ease, add features to machines via software and essentially create a new market. When deployed by equipment manufacturers, it will have societal impact by reducing the number of forklift and other industrial and construction machine related accidents, deaths and property damage. There are secondary benefits such as reducing the amount spent on worker compensation. The scientific impact will be the enhanced understanding of principled approaches to stereoscopic depth estimation combined with machine learning based object detectors to create integrated vision systems that function in real-time on commodity hardware.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the fact that current solutions for autonomous vehicles and machines use expensive LIDARs and RADARs in conjunction with cameras. Such systems are cost-prohibitive and ill-suited for industrial applications that operate in structured warehouse and manufacturing environments rather than highways. Manufacturers can benefit from a cheaper integrated vision-based system where all the necessary algorithms, software and hardware engineering has already been done for them. The intellectual merit of the project lies in achieving the following research goals. 1) Develop an algorithmic approach to stereoscopic depth estimation that combines quick-to-generate classic features (e.g., edges and corners) with machine learning. 2) Combine machine learning based object detectors with stereoscopic depth to create an integrated vision pipeline that functions in real-time on commodity hardware. 3) Devise methods to train the system more easily by relying on depth and motion features. 4) Address critical operational design considerations such as thermal and power management and understand requirements to maintain mechanical and structural integrity through periods of intense use.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project focused on a novel seat design that reduces vehicle-based whole-body vibration and shock will 1) better protect human health while 2) addressing major transportation markets including trucking, agriculture, construction, military vehicles, and mass transit, as well as automobiles and water-/land-based recreational vehicles.  The envisioned socio-economic impact is significant:  Continual exposure to whole-body vibration and shocks can cause discomfort, reduction in work performance, and chronic low-back pain for vehicle operators and passengers.  Low-back pain is the largest component of disability among all occupational-related injuries. Though so-called "active" seats can help reduce these vibrations/shocks, their high cost is a major barrier. The low-cost seats being pursued here could benefit millions of vehicle operators. The work will also result in a greater scientific and technological understanding of the sources/effects of and potential remedies for whole-body vibration and shock. The suspension system market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 5.11%, by value, from 2016 to 2021. The market is expected to grow from USD 52.38 Billion in 2015 to USD 67.22 Billion by 2021.  The market for bus seats alone is expected to be at $10.03 Billion by the year 2022.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is focused on the feasibility of a quasi-semi-active seat (QSAS) technology.  Seating design for heavy equipment and vehicle operators has faced a trade-off between performance and cost. The most-complex 'active seats' reduce vibration but are cost-prohibitive at $3,500. Semi-active seats are simplified active seats and perform better than passive seats, but still magnify input vibration and cost several thousand dollars. Passive seats are the least expensive, but they magnify input vibration at low frequencies.  Recent design/material advances and strong preliminary data set the stage for developing an innovative passive seat at a fraction of the cost of semi-active seats that will reduce input vibration at low frequencies. Phase I feasibility will be shown using sliding friction to mitigate vibration at low frequency.  A QSAS prototype will be built and used to show potential in laboratory and field settings.  Technical challenges will involve material selection that will show maximum vibration mitigation and dissipation, as well as integration of the cushion with a suspension system that can handle the weight of a seated person. The research will determine effective performance parameters under different magnitudes and frequencies of vibration that simulate realistic operational conditions.

- abstractText: "The broader impact / commercial potential of this project would be
    in the ability to deploy drones in industrial and commercial indoor environments
    as aerial robots.  A key requirement to deploying drones in such indoor environments
    in the presence of people is to make them safe and non-threatening.  In addition,
    for drones to function as robots, they need to be made fully autonomous and minimize
    the need for human operation or intervention.  These attributes are not possible
    with conventional drone technology today.  The ability to use drones as aerial
    robots can open up opportunities in large markets such as warehouse inventory
    scanning, construction, security, and factory automation.  Such robots can enable
    functions such as scanning and reconstruction of the environment, or also ?pick
    and place? at high throughput within factories.  The use of drones in industrial
    indoor environments for these applications can also result in broader societal
    benefits, including improved worker safety inside industrial indoor environments
    (by performing tasks that may otherwise require harnesses, forklifts or ladders);
    reduced environmental impacts (in construction sites by catching discrepancies
    early and minimizing rework and material wastage) and macroeconomic benefits (enabling
    automated factories of the future and bringing back US jobs).  \n\nThis Small
    Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project has the potential to advance
    the frontiers of knowledge in design and control systems for use in drones and
    other applications.  This unique approach redefines the control systems for rotorcraft,
    and enables a drone with dramatically improved metrics ? as much as 10X -- that
    are traditionally used to characterize the performance of drones.  In this Phase
    I project, Vimaan plans to complete the design and modeling of the system, develop
    the control mechanisms for the system, and integrate, test and demonstrate the
    application of the innovation to a drone that has the above attributes.  During
    the project, Vimaan will need to overcome some critical technical challenges in
    the components and systems design, the control circuitry and controls algorithms
    and the power budgets, timings and optimizations of the sub-systems for the required
    performance.  If successful, such an innovation would revolutionize decades old
    legacy technologies that have been hitherto deployed in rotorcraft, and make possible
    attributes that have been long sought after by the aerospace industry.\n\nThis

    This SBIR Phase I project will address the pedagogical and evaluative problems caused by our current inability to measure core outcomes beyond information recall. The proposed innovation makes important educational outcomes such as deep understanding, cognition (thinking skills) and awareness of thinking (metacognition) measurable. Reliable assessment of these outcomes has broad significance to education and society writ large, as many employers struggle with skills gaps between high school and college graduates and the professional, personal and societal demands on adults in the 21st Century. This research combines cognitive science, epistemology, systems science, and complex systems with new developments in artificial intelligence, including machine learning and neural networks, and aligns well with the NSF's mission to promote progress in science and advance national prosperity. This project not only has the potential to impact core tenets of educational practice - including how teachers teach, how learners learn, and how we measure and understanding knowledge - but also may have impact on science through increased ability to map and analyze patterns and common structures in knowledge and generally for Americans to increase their developmental skills and abilities. Beginning in an educational market valued at $8-15 billion, this project has the potential to catalyze significant job creation and have significant commercial impact across a range of related industries.

    This SBIR Phase I project introduces a visual grammar for mapping ideas in a canvas-based environment, and provides a neural-network based mechanism for quantitatively comparing expressions of complex ideas along many dimensions to facilitate a new approach to thinking, learning, and assessment. Maps of ideas will be tokenized and serialized and then fed through a recurrent neural network model to produce encoded numeric vector representations that are meaningfully comparable in their encoded form. Once in this form, vectors will be compared and evaluated for content and structure similarity, and insights offered in many dimensions: depth of detail, understanding of relationships, and numerous other meaningful measures. These vectors enable scalable, consistent, constructive assessment in a way not previously possible. In the mapping environment, teachers and students will create maps either on their own, or collaboratively together in real-time. As users create maps, we use the generated vectors to analyze both content and structure, and then prompt users to think about their subject matter from new perspectives. As a means of evaluation, teachers will create mapping activities for students to complete, and then student maps will be quantitatively compared to the standards and target maps which represent the complete understanding of the topic.

    This SBIR Phase I project focuses on development of a prototype for a Virtual Music Helper (VMH) for children. Research confirms that music and music learning enhances intelligence, learning and IQ specially in kids. Even children with attention deficit/ hyperactivity disorder benefit from listening to music beforehand in mathematics tests. Children who learn or practice music have shown better results in STEM subjects. However, studies also suggest children opt out of music class based on false belief that they lack musical ability and many kids often find the music practice non-engaging, and boring eventually losing interest and quitting. Parents find it challenging to entice the kids to sit down and practice or they cannot help their kids because either they don?t have time or are not music savvy themselves to help them. The virtual music helper can read the kids? music homework, guide them through the exercise and provide immediate correction. This helper is not to replace teachers, but help the parents at home and encourage kids to practice more. In broader terms this project may spur significant research in finding effective methods for tutoring kids in subjects other than music such as math or language, or for kids with special needs.


    This SBIR Phase I project proposes a Virtual Music Helper (VMH) that is empowered by Artificial Intelligence and Augmented Reality for kids. VMH is a 3D mobile-virtual-human (avatar) that can be personalized for each kid and conduct live dialog with kids both from visual and behavioral perspectives. VHM offers smart content for teachers about each student's progress and weak points. The technical challenges this project will address is the detection and correction of mistakes kids make including polyphonic pitch detection from acoustic instrument, conversion of note sheets to machine readable music format with high accuracy and speed, empowering the avatar with decision making algorithms to provide proper correction and feedback verbally and visually. This platform is also intended to support multiple popular instruments and multiple languages.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project can be summarized as follows. (1) Businesses will benefit from the proposed product because companies are increasingly using data-driven predictive models to improve their bottom line. In many areas where structured data are readily available, such as credit scoring, these models have produced impressive returns on investment. One of the main obstacles hindering the application of these models in other areas is the lack of structured data. By extracting information from sources such as web pages, blogs and social media messages, and storing it as structured data, companies will be able to take advantage of the vast amount of unstructured data that are generated daily and thereby improve their bottom line. (2) As the Chinese economy expands and becomes more deeply intertwined with the US economy, many US businesses will need high-quality and timely information about Chinese markets. However, information extraction from Chinese text is an underserved area. The proposed product can fill this void and thereby meet a significant commercial demand.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a new information extraction (IE) method. Currently IE focuses on information extraction from short text snippets consisting of a few words in order to derive structured factual information from unstructured text. But its performance is often deteriorated by the shortage of features - the sparse feature problem. A major benefit of the approach developed in this project is that it takes advantage of the important role of specific linguistic units even when the number of words in a sentence is limited. These linguistic units give a sentence its structure. Depending on structural characteristics or functional principles of sentences, the features around them are grouped. The grouped features satisfy certain properties and can be used to capture structural and semantic information, which is helpful for minimizing the sparse feature problem.

    market for this innovation is the high-end bicycle spoke market, which is valued
    at over $100M. The research of new polymeric materials at universities is at an
    all-time high. Despite this, there exists a gap in the commercialization of new
    materials because of the difficulty in interfacing these materials to other common
    construction materials, such as stainless steel. This work will contribute fundamental

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to use controversy detection to support financial institutions' ability to reduce their risks and increase profits. This is part of a growing trend towards "alternative data" products relying on artificial intelligence and machine learning. Besides the financial industry, there are numerous potential applications of controversy detection technology in a variety of market verticals, such as crisis management, defense applications, and advertising technology. Beyond commercial applications, there is scope for social impact by opening analysis and explanatory power of controversies to individual users. Controversies have a massive impact on civic society and the so-called "filter bubble" exacerbates polarization, both political and otherwise; fake news on both sides of the political spectrum has recently captured public attention and generated political concern. Positive impact on society from commercializing this technology includes helping users become better informed and more capable of critically evaluating the often-overwhelming stream of online content. Proving the feasibility of this innovation in a highly quantifiable space such as finance could answer a customer need in that space and create new jobs for the economy, while enabling social good applications that can improve civic society.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project relies on sophisticated machine learning and information retrieval techniques to automatically detect controversial topics. The initial data were collected at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, using NSF-supported research, which recognized controversy by mapping the text of a webpage to algorithmically-identified controversial topics. Research has demonstrated that controversy cannot be detected using existing methods of sentiment analysis, a widely-adopted natural language processing method. This project bridges the gap between the current capabilities of this nascent technology and the clear user need in the financial domain. It will evaluate the feasibility of controversy detection by applying a real-time controversy detection signal to financial data to reduce risk and increase returns.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is reduced levelized cost of electricity (LCOE)
    of offshore wind from current levels that are about twice that of onshore wind.
    Given the proximity of offshore wind resources to load centers along the coast,
    it is an attractive renewable energy source for the nation, but high costs are
    an impediment to widespread adoption. One way to address this is with larger turbines
    that can lead to lower ?balance of plant? costs, which can be as high as 65% of
    the total project costs of offshore wind. However, turbine rating is currently
    limited due to the large size and weight of the generator and the rotor, as well
    as infrastructure obstacles like manufacturing, transport, and assembly. The lightweight
    superconducting (SC) generators being developed within this project, coupled with
    advanced rotors already being developed by the OEM?s, could open the door to significantly
    larger turbine ratings and lower costs. The underlying high specific power machine
    technology can also help transform a number of other weight-sensitive electrical
    systems like hybrid electric airplanes and ship propulsion.\n \nThis Small Business
    Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to disrupt the traditional risk
    versus benefit trade of the low Technology Readiness Level (TRL) SC technology
    by significantly increasing the benefits with a novel ?active magnetic shielding?
    concept. This design concept enables a very high operating magnetic field within
    the machine while eliminating the need for a yoke made of ferromagnetic steel
    to contain the field. The higher internal fields increase the electromagnetic
    torque significantly over other solutions, leading to very high power density.
    Additionally, the elimination of heavy iron from the magnetic circuit leads to
    further reduction in weight. The proposed generator design can be about half the
    size of currently available wind direct-drives. Efficiency is also expected to
    improve with the elimination of about a third of copper coils while maintaining
    the same current density. Available cryogenic cooling technology from the commercially
    successful magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) industry will be adapted and utilized
    in the machine to reduce many of the cryogenics related risks while maintaining
    high specific power.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been

    This STTR Phase 1 project seeks to develop an automated system that would significantly increase the speed and accuracy of biopsy assessments at the point of care. The proposed technology eliminates extensive manual tissue processing steps and generates digital images of fresh biopsies that look just like standard pathology slides. The imaging can be performed in seconds, thus improving the efficiency of biopsy assessments at the point of care. Rapid, whole fresh biopsy imaging also improves evaluation accuracy while maximally preserving tissue for further testing and facilitating remote pathology consultation. With over five million patients in the United States undergoing biopsy procedures each year, and one in five of those patients returning for repeat procedures due to inaccuracies in biopsy assessments, an increase in accuracy and procedure speed could have a profound impact. This could lead to decreases in patient procedure time and decreases in repeat procedure rates, preventing unnecessary, painful, and invasive repeat biopsy procedures. With an estimated 1.6 billion USD spend on repeat procedures per year, this would also represent a significant decrease in financial burden on patients. In addition, due to the decrease in time per procedure, this could increase procedure throughput for hospitals, thus increasing hospital revenue potential. Finally, by producing remotely viewable images, this system could be utilized in a remote pathology setting at underserved communities within the US.

    This STTR Phase I project seeks to develop an automated sample processing and tissue pathology imaging system that delivers biopsy-to-image in a completely automated manner on fully-intact fresh tissues within five minutes of tissue removal.  Through integration with the previously developed Video-Rate Structured Illumination Microscopy (VR-SIM) system as the integrated optical sectioning modality, and using novel fluorescence dye combinations that recapitulate gold-standard histology,  the throughput, efficiency, and accuracy of biopsy evaluation can be improved while maximally preserving tissue for downstream processing and readily facilitating telepathology consultation. Preliminary work in multiple fresh tissue preparations, including core-needle biopsies and whole surgical resections,  indicates that the technology and method can deliver high image quality and diagnostic accuracy in short, clinically-relevant timeframes. A prototype of an automated, disposable cartridge system for biopsy staining and imaging for effortless integration with VR-SIM imaging will be developed. Image quality will be optimized at the highest optical sectioning power to be equivalent to physically-sectioned tissues, using polarization-gated VR-SIM and novel immersion media. ADPL workflow testing, validation of diagnostic image quality, and verification of compatibility with downstream analysis in human biopsy samples will be completed.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project lies in helping more amputees walk safely with less effort. There are approximately 800,000 individuals living with a major lower limb amputation, and this number is growing largely due to diabetes. For 50,000 amputees each year who need a new prosthetic knee, two options exist:  learn to use a traditional prosthetic knee or attempt to obtain a high-tech, computer-controlled knee. The former require the amputee learn and execute specific technique(s) to walk safely, while the latter do so automatically but cost $30,000 to $100,000 and require physical qualification, greatly limiting their availability. The novel prosthetic knee developed here offers stability automatically, regardless of amputee technique. It prevents buckling while simultaneously allowing the user to walk safely with whatever leg motions the user is able to generate. Since it requires no electronics or power, it is available to all amputees regardless of ability, and at a fraction of the cost of high-tech knees. Amputees will be able to walk farther with less effort, improving health and quality of life, and easing caregiver burden. Additionally, this design could be adapted for use in orthotic, robotic or exoskeletal systems.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop and test a novel prosthetic knee. Funding would be used to build prototypes and conduct mechanical, analytical and destructive testing. This testing is necessary to demonstrate that the design is feasible, safe for humans, and deserving of further development with amputees. An independent engineering design review will be obtained, prototypes will then be bench tested for function in a biomechanics lab, and an independent lab will provide destructive testing to prove ultimate strength of the device for comparison against known standards. The anticipated technical results include proof that the device can support the weight of a 300lb person, and quantitative evidence that the device will afford intuitive and universally available stability to amputees through its innovative swing- and stance-phase functionality. This work would advance the knowledge of prosthetics, rehabilitation and bipedal locomotion.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) project is the creation of a control system that enables the next
    generation of high capacity lithium metal batteries to replace current lithium
    ion battery technology. The global lithium-ion battery market is expected to grow
    to $67.70 billion USD by end of 2022 from $31.17 billion USD in 2016. However,
    lithium ion batteries cannot store sufficient energy required by the applications
    contributing most to that growth (i.e., electric vehicles) as demonstrated by
    the slow adoption within the largest battery powered product markets today.  Lithium
    metal batteries were conceived decades ago and are capable of storing three times
    the energy of lithium ion batteries.  Yet inherent chemical instability renders
    them extremely dangerous to recharge, preventing their use.  This project is the
    next phase of work to develop a system that monitors and maintains the stability
    of lithium metal batteries during charging, enabling safe and reliable use by
    consumers, businesses, and government.  The complete solution will consist of
    licensable hardware and software which can be tailored to specific battery powered
    applications, integrating with battery cells or charging systems for consumer
    electronics, long range electric vehicles, medical devices, and grid storage systems.
    \ \n\nThis SBIR Phase I project funds the continued development of a new paradigm
    in battery healing: maintaining battery electrode health from the outside in.
    The system uses software and electronics that control surface issues on battery
    electrodes which otherwise cause permanent loss of capacity and life during normal
    use.  As an important part of the overall solution being developed, the key technical
    hurdles addressed by this proposed SBIR project are focused on real-time electrode
    surface sensing and mapping capabilities and control strategies to suppress dendrites,
    as well as advanced characterization methods to monitor and share electrode health
    information with other components to ensure safety, reliability and durability
    of the overall energy storage system. The R&D plan will include development of
    live mapping of electrochemically active surfaces, control software to develop
    an algorithm and feedback system, and machine learning to improve sensing-mapping-control
    strategies.  The most promising set of solutions will be demonstrated and validated
    in an operando visualization test cell that allows observation of the formation
    and suppression of dendrites on lithium metal electrodes.\n\nThis award reflects

    This SBIR Phase I project will explore the technical, commercial, and educational potentials of bringing augmented reality binocular kiosks to public locations and their ability to create lasting impact on the public's understanding of a place. The proposed research and development phase will focus on the deployment and field testing of a collection of prototypes with partner locations, and examine their efficacy at engaging and informing visitors of those sites. The broader significance of the project is the development of an information device and ecosystem that gives the public a better understanding of notable places and the greater physical world. Deployments will be able to visualize a variety of site-specific data, from environmental conditions, to geological formations and landmark navigation. Potential revenue can be generated in partnership with locations, allowing for sustainable long-term engagements between the project and a site. Direct economic impact is brought to a location and its surroundings through increased foot traffic and the encouragement of additional exploration of a space.


    The innovation being proposed is stereoscopic wide-field-of-view see-through augmented reality viewers in the form of landscape binocular kiosks designed to give public spaces a way to engage visitors with the natural, scientific, and historic features of that location. In addition to displaying immersive media experiences optically overlaid onto a view of the real world, this project creates a distributed media network on that location to share data and content for remote viewing and analysis. Goals and scope of research include durability testing of the devices in prolonged public exposure, effectiveness of the user interface and software tools, understanding the range and bandwidth of device-to-device communication, and optimization of the optical, electromechanical, and sensor components. Methods and approaches will include the field testing of prototype units with partner locations, and using survey and analysis techniques to evaluate the overall quantitative and qualitative efficacy of the intervention at those sites.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to provide analytical technology that will foster the commercial development of complicated biomanufactured products. The most pressing need is to reduce the time and cost to bring the latest generation of biotherapeutic drugs to market. Currently, upwards of eight years and $1B is spent to move a candidate drug from discovery through final approval. Along the way $300M is consumed by analytical testing procedures to certify the product.  The American healthcare system will benefit from new and less expensive analytical technologies that reduce certification costs and lead to less expensive drugs. Manufacturing efficiency also can be improved using the proposed technology. Biomanufactured products are harvested from cultured cells, and there are times when the culturing process fails to produce a perfect product. Detecting impurities and spoilage during manufacturing will further reduce manufacturing costs and directly benefit the consumer through the delivery of better therapeutic products and treatment regimens.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to quantify the validity of an ion mobility spectrometer as a high-throughput tool for screening conformational variation, purity, and aggregation of biotherapeutic drugs. Conformation imparts functionality to a protein and any variation in conformation implies there is a variation in biochemical activity, which is undesirable. Ion mobility is a technique that determines molecular cross-section, which in turn is a measure of a molecule's conformation. The gold standard for determining protein conformation is x-ray crystallography, a methodology limited by throughput. There is an unmet need to develop faster ways to measure protein conformation. The proposed technology determines a protein conformation rapidly across all phases of biotherapeutic drug development from discovery, expression system testing, scale up and manufacturing. Additionally, the patented design for this ion mobility spectrometer provides a way to measure changes in conformation that might result as a consequence of exposure to thermal, chemical, and photo-induced stress as needed for drug stability and developability testing.  The proposed work will quantify resolution, reproducibility, accuracy, and throughput for this benchtop instrument. The evaluation will be performed using antigen-antibody pairs and several biotherapeutic drugs in collaboration with an academic group and industry partners.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is an innovative
    new capacitor technology based on kilohertz high-frequency supercapacitor, called
    AC-Supercap, aiming to replace conventional aluminum electrolytic capacitors (AECs)
    for a vast range of electronic and power systems. Capacitors are an essential
    component used in electronic devices, in power supplies driving electrical machines,
    appliances and instruments, as well as in power conversion and conditioning systems
    used for renewable energy generation. In the consumer electronics sector, miniaturization
    and low-profile or even flexible packaging, and higher power efficiency are some
    of the key demands. In the power system and other power-demanding industry sectors,
    large capacitance, large ripple current absorption, and high temperature rating
    are the key requirements. With the emergence of distributed wireless sensors and
    Internet of Things (IoT), pulse energy storage and generation will be necessary
    as well. AC-Supercap, with its much better performance than current solutions,
    is anticipated to better serve the needs of broad range of customers. Upon the
    success of this technology, there will also be tremendous impact on the local
    ecosystem and regional community of West Texas. \n\nThis Small Business Technology
    Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will investigate the feasibility of producing
    AC-Supercap as high-performance alternating current (AC) filtering capacitors
    for power modules, on-board application, or as compact and efficient pulse power
    storage. Conventional AECs, limited by their low capacitance density, bulky size,
    poor lifetime, large equivalent series resistance, and polarity sensitivity cannot
    meet technical needs well. To achieve AC-Supercaps with both large capacitance
    density and high-frequency response, two contradictory requirements, and nanostructured
    electrode engineering will be investigated. To produce a compact capacitor with
    a large voltage rating and capacitance, multicell integration will be optimally
    designed and demonstrated, which is crucial considering the intrinsic low voltage
    rating of a single cell. The proposed innovative solutions to these technical
    challenges will de-risk the AC-Supercap product prototyping in the following project
    phases to make ready the technology for commercialization. These research activities
    will advance the scientific understanding and technological development of nanostructured
    electrode process and property control, multicell integration design, and particularly
    AC-Supercap technology.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has

    demonstrate the commercial feasibility of a manufacturing platform for functionalizing
    textile materials with smart functionality such as for wearable smart garments
    developed out of the NSF funded ASSIST Engineering Research Center for Self-powered
    Wearable Nanosystems. Smart garments have been touted as the next sensing platform
    for acquiring biometrics such as electrocardiogram, heart rate, or heart rate
    variability. However, mass adoption has been difficult due to the high production
    cost, leading to a small market segment within the greater wearable technology
    market. As demonstrated by our customer discovery through the NSF I-Corps program
    in Fall 2016, the biggest barrier to adoption is the production cost. This project
    seeks to decrease the cost by 5x and decrease production time by 36x, enabling
    this market segment to grow for applications in health & wellness, healthcare,
    and beyond. By employing high-throughput direct-write printing and deposition
    of functional dielectric and conductive materials from the printed electronics
    space, high-value data generating devices such as smart garments can be manufactured
    in a single step bridging established practices within the textile and electronics
    industry resulting in automated textile electronics. Novel materials will be explored

    \n\nThe broader impact of this project is to create a single manufacturing platform
    that marginalizes the cost of production for textile electronics such as smart

    creating new knowledge and commercial innovations. Lastly, manufacturing within
    the USA has seen a resurgence due to value-added technical textiles manufacturing
    being brought back. An ancillary broader impact of this project is to serve as
    a driver for value-added smart garment manufacturing technologies to be employed
    for USA manufacturing. Success of this project's vision will allow for low-cost
    smart textiles to usher in a paradigm shift for the textiles industry, allowing
    for a multitude of use-cases and innovative business models to proliferate, ultimately

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to reduce the power required to cool the data and telecommunications centers that drive the internet age. Currently nearly 2.0% of the energy consumed in the United States is used to run such data centers and, often, half of this is used for cooling. The corresponding greenhouse gas emissions will also be reduced. Longer term this technology can be adapted to increasing the efficiency of air-conditioning/refrigeration and power generation. Commercially, the computational fluid dynamics software market the product will compete in is projected to grow from $1.3 billion at present to over $2 billion by 2022. It will also stimulate the growth of the manufacture of specialty heat sinks with optimal geometries for efficient thermal management.

    This intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase I project is based on proposing to hybridize three common numerical methods, i.e., computational fluid dynamics (CFD), flow network modeling (FNM) and multi-variable optimization (MVO), a non-trivial objective. The result will be a software platform that can accurately and simultaneously optimize the geometry of an array of heat sinks found in various types of circuit packs, e.g., blade servers in data centers. This is not possible with CFD alone as it is too slow and it is not possible with FNM alone as it is not sufficiently accurate. The method of the hybrid approach to preserve the accuracy of CFD is to embed pre-computed, non-dimensional look-up tables of flow and thermal resistances from CFD simulations in an FNM. The software will accommodate both single-phase flows of air and water and evaporating/boiling flows of water and refrigerant, which requires modeling complex heat, mass and momentum transport phenomena. Experiments will validate its accuracy on thermal mock-ups of circuit packs.

    This SBIR Phase I project will help advance the health and welfare of individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS) - a debilitating chronic inflammatory disease affecting nearly 1 million people in the United States. A non-invasive, wearable retinal imaging device will be developed for at-home patient use that detects changes in MS disease activity, enabling patients and their physicians to track responses to treatment and detect disease flare-ups between clinical visits. Early detection and proper treatment of MS is crucial to reducing the risk of disease progression and disability. Current practice relies on infrequent neurological and radiological exams to assess changes in disease activity and treatment efficacy. However, there is currently no way to monitor MS in real time between these visits. Research relating retinal pathology to MS processes in the brain demonstrate that retinal imaging can provide early detection of disease events, offering an alternative monitoring pathway. This device will thus help reduce increases in patient healthcare costs associated with increasing disability, and potentially impact the research and care of patients with other brain conditions that manifest in the retina, including traumatic brain injury, epilepsy, and addiction. Following FDA approval, the device will be sold to MS patients, neurologists, and researchers.

    This project will yield a novel retinal imaging device that uses optical coherence tomography (OCT) and fundus autofluorescence (FAF) to assess retinal biomarkers associated with MS progression. While OCT and FAF are widely-used modalities for imaging the retina, the proposed device differentiates itself from current technologies in that it is specifically designed for use by MS patients at home. This will include a ruggedized, ergonomic, and wearable design suited for those who suffer from low mobility and other symptoms that make trips to a clinic difficult. Patients will use the device briefly once a week, during which time retinal images will be automatically acquired, analyzed, and sent to a physician for remote review. As such, it will further increase engagement between patients and physicians by making patients more proactively involved in their disease management. For this project, the following objectives are planned: 1) Develop the OCT component of the device to acquire high-resolution and repeatable images of layers in a healthy tissue-mimicking phantom retina, 2) Develop the FAF component of the device, and 3) Validate the device?s ability to acquire high-resolution and repeatable images of retinal layer thicknesses and autofluorescence in post-mortem retinas from MS patients and healthy individuals.

    oxygen mapping in vitro and in vivo. The field of tissue engineering regenerative
    medicine combines the principles of the life sciences, cell biology, and engineering
    to create functional tissues and organs that can be used for replacing damaged
    tissues and organs. The public health benefit of replacing damaged tissues and

    in artificial tissue grafts, which is one of the major causes of tissue failure,
    by developing an oxygen imaging instrument to generate three-dimensional in situ
    oxygen maps. This instrument will allow scientists to assess oxygen environment
    over the time of graft production and upon implantation and develop better artificial
    tissues. The oxygen imager uses cutting-edge radiofrequency and magnet technology
    and will help create high-tech jobs in the Midwest. \n\nThe oxygen imager will

    contrast agent, trityl that has oxygen-dependent relaxation rates. EPROI provides
    absolute partial oxygen pressure (pO2) maps with high accuracy (~ 1 torr) within
    1-10 minutes. The oxygen imager will be equipped with a 25 mT magnet and ~720
    MHz electronics suitable for in vitro and small animal in vivo oxygen imaging.
    The instrument will have user-friendly software for image acquisition, image registration,
    data processing and analysis. This project will develop the magnet with the top
    loading of samples along with temperature and gas controlled bioreactor sample
    chamber for in vitro oxygen mapping of artificial tissues. The robustness and
    performance of the imager will be tested by acquiring oxygen maps of cell-seeded
    biomaterials. It is expected that the oxygen imager will become an essential tool
    in tissue engineering labs of academic institutions and biotech companies and
    will have a major impact on the successful development of regenerative medicine

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to sell affordable backup generators that provide 23 kilowatts, for operating a home's lights and appliances. With power outages due to natural disasters and an aging power grid becoming ever more frequent, and with society increasingly reliant on electricity to power not only lights and household appliances, but also computers, wireless routers, and medical devices, back-up power is an increasingly critical need. This SBIR's portable generator is expected to be more than an order of magnitude lower cubic size and weight, all at a reduced cost compared to existing generators.  The broader impact of this project is its significant benefits to the environment by providing backup power at high fuel efficiency (i.e. less consumption of non-renewable fossil fuels) and low emissions of hydrocarbons, particulate matter, carbon monoxide, and smoke.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to address the shortcomings of residential-use backup generators currently on the market. Available backup generators are either small and affordable but can only power a single appliance; or able to power most of a home's needs but cumbersome and expensive. This project will demonstrate the potential for implementing a free-piston internal combustion engine that will maximize fuel efficiency; minimize size; decrease dependence on lubricating oil; and incorporate an engine management system. The objective of the current effort is the engine, while the functioning compact generator will be developed in the next phase. In this free-piston engine design, the two pistons oscillate with forces in balance and reduced side-loads to the pistons, yielding a long-lasting high-speed engine. The pilot work included modification of the cylinder intake ports; addition of a modified squish band and dome to the cylinder head; and use of low-friction bearing materials yielding a successful prototype that runs on regular gasoline. The engineers will continue implementing, testing, and improving on these modifications. The successful completion of this project will yield an efficient, compact, low-weight, and low-emissions generator that produces 23 kilowatts of usable power that runs on standard pump gasoline.

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase I Project will productize a quantitative data processing
    technology in dynamic positron emission tomography (PET). Dynamic PET's distinction
    from its static counterpart is in the fact that it collects time-dependent tracer
    concentration data. It is a highly sensitive and accurate way of functional and
    molecular imaging of protein targets such as biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease,
    Parkinson's disease, or brain trauma. Unfortunately, dynamic PET is rarely used
    in clinic because of long imaging time and complex processing. The technology
    to be developed in this proposal will shorten the required imaging time and simplify
    the analysis, allowing for accurate and reliable imaging of disease biomarkers
    for aiding drug development, clinical diagnostics, and treatment monitoring. The
    proposed analytic workflow will be offered as a cloud-based service that can be
    used by the customers to analyze new or historical PET datasets. In order to overcome
    the established practice of relying on less accurate and informative static PET
    imaging, the grant recipients plan to conduct a thorough validation of the new
    technology using a dedicated physical phantom and human subject images acquired
    in the past. The largest impact of the new technology is expected in medical research
    and drug development. \n\nThe accepted practice of analyzing dynamic PET datasets
    involves reconstruction of the parameters of implied compartment model describing
    the tracer biochemistry, which involves several accuracy-degrading approximations
    and requires lengthy acquisition. The alternative approach proposed in this project
    relies on decomposing the dynamic PET image sequences using a combination of several
    processing techniques that incorporate the essential features of tracer pharmacokinetics
    without making explicit assumptions about the model parameters or about the underlying
    anatomy. The key part of the proposed methodology is factor analysis of dynamic
    structures, a non-negative matrix decomposition technique with successful past
    applications in radionuclide image analysis. The result of the workflow is a 3D
    concentration of tissues that exhibit specific-binding of the radiotracer. In
    order to validate the quantitative accuracy of the approach, the researchers will
    build and image a dedicated physical phantom capable of producing overlapping
    distributions with different tracer dynamics. In order to validate the scan-time
    reduction claims, the new workflow will be used to analyze existing dynamic PET
    human subject datasets using increasingly shorter input time windows.\n\nThis
    award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
    evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
    criteria."

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology
    Transfer (STTR) project is the advancement of improved lithium ion batteries.
    The project will evaluate new battery chemistry enabling more rapid charging rates
    then currently available in the worldwide energy storage marketplace. Such high
    power density batteries would cater to a major emerging battery segment where
    current lithium ion battery technologies fall dramatically short. Successful development
    of this innovation will provide benefits to both current and future applications.
    Clearly, large scale deployment of a markedly superior energy storage device will
    have significant societal benefits by accelerating the move away from fossil fuel
    in many applications and products. For instance, a viable regenerative braking
    energy storage technology based on the proposed technology would result in a tremendous
    reduction in electricity used by subway trains, with a concomitant reduction of
    CO2 emissions. \n\nThis STTR Phase I project proposes to address the core of the
    microstructure - performance relations in energy storing materials, answering
    a series of fundamental questions regarding how a charge carrier is reversibly
    or irreversibly stored at high rates in manganese oxide - carbon nanocomposite
    anodes. In conventional LIBs, it is the graphite-based anode that limits charging
    rates, with catastrophic lithium metal plating and dendrite growth occurring at
    increased currents. It is expected that many of the existing \"Graphite - Inherited\"
    paradigms regarding fast rate in anodes would be done away with, or substantially
    redefined with the proposed approach for designing high power lithium ion batteries
    based on an inexpensive hemp-derived carbon nanosheets and nanostructured manganese
    oxide anodes. A much clearer understanding of the synthesis - structure - property
    relations in such nanocomposites will have wide-reaching scientific and technological
    implications. Research and development activities will focus on structural optimization
    and manufacturing scalability along with fabrication and testing of near-commercial
    pouch cell form factors in order to demonstrate device-level performance and commercial
    viability of the proposed technology.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project is to develop an external stent that can improve the quality and length of life for dialysis patients. Dialysis is the primary lifeline for End-Stage Renal Disease patients. Unfortunately, our current standard of care, which provides no additional support or treatment to the artery-vein connections surgically created in the arm to initiate dialysis (i.e. access sites), results in 40-60% failure rates within the first year. Consequences of these failures are dire: significant pain, suffering, and death for dialysis patients, hospital readmission penalties, and more than $1B in direct costs to Medicare. An external stent that wraps around the vein-artery/-graft junction of dialysis patients at the time of access site creation surgery has been developed to reduce these failures in a preventative fashion. In order to maximize the impact that it can have on the lives of dialysis patients by providing favorable flow conditions (i.e. hemodynamics) through the access site, it is imperative to first optimize device design on the bench with the aid of computational modeling. Findings from this grant will further scientific understanding of external supports and the role that hemodynamics play in access site failures.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to create a computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model that successfully predicts flow and deformation conditions at the access site in the presence or absence of an external stent, and to use this model to identify external stent design parameters that promote the most favorable hemodynamic environment for preventing access site failures. First, a 3D printing method of manufacture will be optimized to enable the fabrication of external stents in a highly-repeatable manner conducive to large-scale, FDA-compliant production. A CFD model will be created from empirical results in which surgically-constructed anastomoses (e.g. vein-graft junctions) are exposed to arteriovenous-mimetic pressure and flow conditions in the absence or presence of external stent designs. Empirical ex vivo data to validate the CFD model simulation results will be collected from quantitative measurements of dynamic deformation (e.g. magnitude of expansion) and flow patterns (i.e. velocity fields) in the presence or absence of various external stent designs via 4D flow MRI, which provides spatial and temporal information on 3D flow over the entire anastomosis. This work should result in the identification of a few designs that assert hemodynamic effects conducive to reducing neointimal hyperplasia, the primary culprit of access site failures.

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase I project aims to identify optimal doses of blue
    light required to inactivate common clinical pathogens known to cause surgical
    site infections, and test a prototype antimicrobial light emitting dressing that
    uses the bactericidal effects of blue light to inactivate surface colonizing bacteria
    and disinfect surgical sites. The potential outcomes of the proposed activity
    are the development of a thin reusable blue light-emitting bandage that provides
    effective post-operative site disinfection, ultimately reducing nosocomial related
    infections. The proposed activity would further the development of antimicrobial
    blue light therapy devices, providing novel solutions to surgical site infections,
    Central Line Bloodstream Associated Infections, and wound infections, because
    of blue light therapy's proven ability to inactivate a wide range of clinical
    pathogens regardless of their resistance to antibiotics, ability to improve wound
    healing, and ability to inactivate bacteria in the biofilm state. The outcomes
    of this project will aid in providing a cost saving solution to Healthcare Associated
    Infections by reducing their occurrence, reducing the risks of human error, and
    improving accountability, quality and workflow. \n\nOptimization of blue light
    therapy is needed for clinical application for killing bacteria on the surface
    of patient's surgical sites, because of a radiant energy threshold that must be
    passed to inactivate bacteria. Due to the variation in devices and doses used
    in previous studies, combined with the clinical need for a device which can be
    easily incorporated into standard infection prevention protocols, further experimentation
    is needed with a device designed as a wearable for clinical implementation.  Objective
    1: Determine optimal light dose (fluence) of blue light (405 nm) required to inactivate
    common gram positive and gram negative bacteria known to cause SSIs. Using in
    vitro techniques, determine the total fluence of light and treatment times required
    to achieve bacterial disinfection of at least a one log reduction in bacteria
    colony forming units.  Objective 2: Optimize device to deliver the effective irradiance
    while maintaining surface temperature below 43 Degree Celsius for safe use on
    tissue. The device is to not exceed 43 Degree Celsius on the surface of the device's
    therapeutic surface while delivering effective irradiance, from Objective 1, for
    inactivation of bacteria on surfaces.  Objective 3: Test the device's infection
    prevention and tissue response in a SSI porcine model. Evaluate the device in
    a porcine SSI model with surface-inoculated sutured incisions, made to the depth
    of the fascia, with optimized light-emitting antimicrobial bandage. Success criteria
    for bacterial disinfection is at least a 90% reduction of CFU per gram of tissue
    or a multiparametric and semiquantitative score (0-3 range) no greater than 1,
    based on standard subjective clinical markers, including fever, erythema, induration,

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to develop an orthopedic device to quantify joint mobility. Millions of musculoskeletal injuries occur each year, which results in pain, swelling, and limitations in joint movement. Unfortunately, current joint mobility and ligament assessments are dependent on the clinician?s qualitative evaluation of the ?feel? of a joint, which often results in ineffective treatment. Failure to provide proper treatment delays restoration of motion, inhibits the return of prior function, and leads to lost wages and increased healthcare costs. The goal of this proposal is to develop a transformative device to quantitatively assess joint mobility of the shoulder, elbow, wrist, knee, and ankle. The aim is to take standardized clinical techniques currently performed in a qualitative manner to that of an objective and quantitative mode of assessment. Not only will this device be a first to market product, it will allow us to begin to develop the science of joint mobilization techniques. In addition, the device will accentuate the educational experience for emerging professionals via objective feedback to ?learn? to deliver consistent interventions to each patient. Thus, this device will capitalize on technology to enhance the practice of orthopedics.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a product to quantitatively measure joint movement. Currently, joint mobility and ligament assessments are performed qualitatively (i.e., clinician evaluates the ?feel? of a joint). However, treatments must be precise to enable the return of prior function. Inappropriate treatment can delay restoration of motion, inhibit the return of prior function, and lead to lost wages and increased healthcare costs. The goal of the proposed device is to enable accurate, simple, and inexpensive measurement of the magnitude of linear translation between two joint surfaces of multiple joints. In preliminary testing, we accurately measured millimeters of motion. We now propose to develop a compact, portable prototype that represents the ?best fit? contours for the shoulder, elbow, wrist, knee, and ankle. The use of attachable dovetail interfaces designed for each joint will allow the use of the same device on a variety of joints and permit the device to be interfaced between the patient?s joint and the clinician?s hand to enable the development of standardized protocols. An immediate display of the linear translation will appear via LED. This real-time feedback will impact clinical decision-making and support consistency of techniques for efficacious treatments.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR)
    project is to improve outcomes and decrease costs in the mental health space by engaging
    patients starting with their first therapy session through objective progress reporting and
    post-session motivation. Patients and clinicians alike will be able to track and assess treatment
    progress through self-reported and physiological measures. This innovation builds upon the
    strong academic, government, and industry partnerships that will advance research and
    innovation in the field of biotechnology. By demonstrating improved outcomes and decreased
    costs associated with the utilization of technology, this will pave the way for insurance
    reimbursement (using existing CPT codes) to accelerate market adoption. Additionally, as
    education of patients and the public improves regarding mental health and PTSD in particular,
    the negative stigma surrounding these conditions will decrease and more people in need will
    seek help rather than resorting to unhealthy behavior or even suicide.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to represent an innovative approach that provides easy to
    interpret results tailored to mental health providers, patients, and other non-technical users.
    Current mental health treatment and assessment has lacked qualitative, scientifically-based
    measurement. The need for a scientific measurement is evident, as about 8 percent of all
    adults - 1 of 13 people in this country will develop PTSD during their lifetime. Currently, 60%
    of adults diagnosed with a mental illness don't receive mental health treatment; using proven
    science and physiologic measurements as the foundation for improving treatment and
    monitoring progress for PTSD can help to alleviate some of the stigma surrounding mental
    illnesses. This project aims to demonstrate how implementing a web-based platform can
    improve PTSD treatment by providing physiologically relevant feedback to the patient and by
    providing a tool for the clinician to tailor the therapy to the individual patient. Patients will have
    their subjective measures and physiological data visualized throughout treatment on a software
    platform, with progress being tracked through validated assessment scales. Patients will be
    compared to others in treatment as usual. Results should yield improved quality of life and
    decrease long term healthcare costs for those that use the platform.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project extends from years of research into the impact of Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs), and yet there is still no direct, field assay for toxic cells. The identification of HABs is critical to determine their patterns of occurrence, to protect water and food supplies, and to alert the general public when there is a problem. Harmful Algal Blooms are a world-wide fresh water, brackish water and marine phenomena that occur in every coastal and inland country and annually cause significant economic damage and take human lives. The detection of HABs and their toxins is currently completed by complex, expensive, and time consuming microscopic analyses that do not necessarily provide the critical and timely information that water quality mangers require. Raman spectroscopy provides a strong and distinct fingerprint of HAB cells and their toxins without the need for sample preparation, and can be used on-site at beaches, drinking water reservoirs, or within distributed networks of Raman sensors all communicating through the cloud to provide managers immediate and spatially distinct information on the presence and concentration of potentially toxic cells.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to develop and market an in-situ 3D microscope with on-axis Raman spectroscopy to provide both morphological information and a chemical signature for identification of HAB cells to species, and in some cases specific strains, along with the presence and concentration of toxin on a per cell basis. The novel technical specifications include: 1) the use of Light Field (LF) microscopy to maximize the depth of field to allow for detection of low cell concentrations (< 1 cell/ mL). LF microscopy also provides a 3D image for more complete and accurate morphological assessment of cells and particulates, 2) Advanced software for color and texture feature extraction and classification of cells using Gabor wavelets and a novel color angle feature, which provide 100% classification accuracy in many cases, 3) the use of Resonance Micro-Raman Spectroscopy (RMRS) to collect spectral fingerprints on the inorganic and organic content of cells, particulates and dissolved compounds, and 4) the integration of these technologies into sensor packages as part of the IoT cloud computing thrust that is sure to gain traction over the next few years, and will provide regional protection of both large and small drinking water reservoirs, globally.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this STTR project stems
    from the costs to U.S. food producers of outbreaks of animal diseases.  Producers
    of poultry, pork, and other food proteins lose more than $1B each year to infectious
    diseases, including some that are transmitted through the air.  For diseases having
    an airborne transmission route, protective technologies that are available are
    few and can be costly to implement and operate.  This project furthers the development
    of a new alternative technology, non-thermal plasmas, for the simultaneous removal
    and inactivation in air of the organisms responsible for the transmission of disease
    to livestock.  This project evaluates how conditions in the environment typically
    found near livestock affect the performance of non-thermal plasmas.  This project
    also pursues a technique for accelerating the process of improving non-thermal
    plasma performance, upon the completion of which new and improved non-thermal
    plasma devices can be developed for applications such as this more rapidly than
    is possible now.  Completion of the project will enable the development of lower-cost
    protective technologies for maintaining livestock health, making such technologies
    economically accessible to a larger segment of food protein producers, ultimately
    lowering food costs and increasing domestic food security.  \n\nThis STTR Phase
    I project proposes to experimentally demonstrate and evaluate the effectiveness
    of a non-thermal plasma (NTP) as a means of preventing disease-carrying particles
    in outside air from infecting livestock housed in animal confinement buildings.
    \  NTPs are stable electrical discharges that simultaneously contribute to the
    removal of airborne particles while also subjecting them to chemical attack capable
    of killing harmful viruses.  While NTPs have been demonstrated for disinfection
    of fixed surfaces, and to a lesser degree for the destruction of chemical contaminants
    or biological pathogens in air, the intellectual merit of this project stems from
    its evaluation of trace gases commonly present in the air around livestock, ammonia
    and hydrogen sulfide, and their potential to both enhance and diminish the performance
    of NTPs used in farm environments.   Additionally, this project will identify
    non-biological tracers suitable for use in NTP optimization testing which will
    accelerate the development of improved designs.  Two separate lab-scale NTP reactors
    will be used in the execution of the project.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is that it provides unique secure, tamper resistant record keeping and logging services that leverage blockchain technology for a wide range of IoT applications. The solution will provide significant benefits in terms of performance, cost (e.g., total ownership cost), cyber attack resilience, security and privacy assurance for both IoT device owners, operators, and industries utilizing IoT technology such as transportation, smart city, logistics, supply chain management, manufacture, energy, critical infrastructures.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to develop a scalable auditing, record keeping, and logging system for internal/external operations and data interactions of IoT devices, which are fundamental components to support other critical properties and operations of IoT enabled infrastructures. The record keeping and logging system solves several critical challenges in distributed IoT environment: transaction ordering and data distribution. In addition, the logging and transactional system can be the centric component for producer-consumer style applications.

    The broader impact/commercialization potential of this project is to address the need for a small, low-cost, and high-accuracy angular rate and angular orientation sensor (also known as a gyroscope) for a wide range of applications.  Gyroscopes are desired by many emerging applications such as inertial measurement units for small satellites such as CubeSats, autonomous vehicles, drones, and high-end wearable electronics.  These applications require a gyroscope with a similar price (< $10) but ~10,000 times better accuracy than those currently used in smartphones.  The birdbath resonator gyroscope (BRG) is a novel micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) gyroscope with a strong potential to satisfy the needs of these applications due to significantly better resonance quality and mechanical symmetry than current silicon gyroscopes.  The economic impact of BRGs will be enormous since many industries can utilize high-performance gyroscopes to monitor the dynamics of their systems, provide positional awareness, and improve the performance of other parts of these systems.  Availability of low-cost and high-performance gyroscopes will enable users to further understand their applications and explore their limits and applicability across a broad range of societal needs.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a new batch-level microfabrication technology to enable the commercialization of low-cost, very high-performance MEMS gyroscope from fused-silica.  Gyroscopes available today are either accurate but large and expensive (example: hemispherical resonator gyroscope), or small and cheap but inaccurate (example: smartphone gyroscopes).  High-accuracy silicon MEMS gyroscopes in research are small and accurate but expensive.  This is because silicon has fundamentally low mechanical resonance quality factor (Q) so it is difficult to manufacture high-accuracy gyroscopes with a high yield.  The BRG is a gyroscope made from fused-silica and capable of having low cost, small size, and high performance.  Its fused silica micro mechanical resonator can achieve significantly higher Q than silicon, which allows the BRG to be manufactured with a high yield.  The BRG fabrication process uses a blowtorch to reflow-mold a fused silica substrate into three-dimensional hollow shells with dimensions of several 10s of micrometers to several millimeters with high geometrical accuracy.  The proposed research will significantly enhance our understanding of the relationships among size, design, and process on the performance of the BRG as well as the relationship among detailed process parameters, yield and reproducibility on cost.

    Broader Impacts: The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project include improving food security, while at the same time enhancing the economic viability and environmental sustainability of large-scale production agriculture. In order to improve crop varieties, agricultural production, and sustainability of farming, there is an urgent need for better technologies to acquire under-canopy plant trait and health data. Examples of high-value under-canopy data include emergence, stem width, corn ear height, plant life-cycle events like flowering and fruiting, and symptoms of pathogens, diseases, and nutrient deficiency. Because these data cannot be obtained by aerial imaging, under-canopy data collection has dramatically greater actionability and value compared to aerial data. However no cost-effective, scalable ways of collecting this data are currently available. In fact, the state of the art is manual data collection by crop scientists (and their students or interns), agronomists, crop-scouts or farmers - an extremely labor intensive, and therefore expensive way of collecting this highly valuable data. Our work will greatly enhance the availability of under-canopy data from field crops. The commercial value of the field data for crop breeding is in excess of $50 Million/year for breeding major row-crops in the US.

    Intellectual Merits: This SBIR Phase I project will demonstrate the technical feasibility of autonomously collecting under-canopy data from field crops using TerraSentia, our low-cost ground robot. In preliminary work, we have built the robot hardware, demonstrated its ability to collect high-value plant data from row-crop fields, and analyze it to generate plant-trait information. In the proposed work, we will enable and demonstrate the ability of TerraSentia to collect data autonomously throughout the season. We will demonstrate the technical feasibility of fusing information from low-cost LIDAR, GPS, and vision. We will also demonstrate the feasibility using real-time control algorithms to adapt camera perspective and robot path in order to obtain the highest quality information from the complex and dynamic under- canopy field environments. These high-risk innovations will together enable long-term deployment of TerraSentia for effective data collection and phenotyping, benefiting crop scientists and agricultural product development professionals.

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase I project will develop a very long-acting buprenorphine
    formulation to increase patient compliance and address the opioid crisis. Poor
    medication compliance is a significant driver of health care costs. The US would
    save an estimated 290 billion dollars yearly or 13% of the total health care budget
    if patients took their medications as directed. Patients with chronic diseases
    are the least compliant with medication. There is an evolving consensus that Opioid
    Misuse Disorder (OMD) is also a chronic disease, and its treatment is also plagued
    by poor compliance. There are an estimated 2.5 million people in the United States
    with OMD. Complete abstinence therapy fails about 80% of the time. Medication-assisted
    therapy using methadone, naltrexone or buprenorphine is far more successful. More
    opioid misuse patients are treated with buprenorphine than methadone, and retention
    in treatment is up to 78% with additional counseling. Still, 80% of all people
    who misuse opioids never obtain any therapy for their disorder, risking overdose,
    other diseases, including HIV and Hepatitis, and amyloidosis. Extended-release
    medications for opioid maintenance therapy would open up more options to get people
    into therapy. A 3-month release formulation of buprenorphine would be a part of
    that strategy.  \n\nBuprenorphine is a partial agonist opioid drug that is used
    for treatment of pain in human and animal patients and for opioid addiction maintenance.
    A platform technology has been developed that can be used to formulate extended-release
    preparations of drugs that are weak bases and are mildly lipophilic. Preparations
    of buprenorphine, naltrexone and doxycycline have been developed using this method.
    The initial proposed product is an injectable formulation of buprenorphine that
    releases over a period of 3 months. This project will address the occurrence of
    a brief peak of early drug release in the 3-month duration buprenorphine formulation.
    The experiments in the current proposal will examine three different methods of
    decreasing the early peak by manipulating the amount of lipid engulfed by macrophages
    at a given dose of drug or by preventing macrophage engulfment of the lipid particles
    entirely by coating the lipid particles with chemicals that make them unlikely
    to be phagocytized. Preliminary results indicate that changing the drug to lipid
    ratio as described in the current proposal will reduce the peak of early release.
    Reducing the early peak will prevent sedative effects, improve the pharmacokinetics
    of the preparation and make dose escalation studies easier and more straight forward.\n\nThis

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project scales the production of renewable monomers that give access to performance nylon polyamides with tailorable functional properties for applications in the automotive, food & beverage packaging, textiles, and other industries. The revolutionary technology will be a disruptive force to the $40 billion nylon polyamide industry by addressing nylon?s weaknesses such as undesired moisture adsorption, which results in loss of dimensional stability and tensile strength. These shortcomings lead industries to make compromises in selecting their materials; for instance, longer chain polyamides are used for moisture resistance but at the expense of desired viscoelastic properties. The proposed bio-advantaged monomers will 1) help ease reliance on petroleum-based chemicals resulting in greener production processes and a cleaner environment, 2) present new opportunities for innovation and use of performance plastics due to the platform that bio-advantaged monomers offer. This is expected to generate new jobs at multiple points in the value chain. Demand for agricultural goods by fermentation facilities will increase. Sumatra Biorenewables and its partners will create jobs to meet demand for monomer production and purification. Finally, polymer producers and the manufacturing industry will produce superior products, increasing the competitiveness of the U.S. chemical industry.

    The intellectual merit of this project is to combine fermentation and chemical conversion for the production of bio-advantaged monomers and their corresponding performance-enhanced polyamides. The inexpensive, robust, and efficient monomer production process in conjunction with the customizable nature of bio-advantaged monomers to yield nylon derivatives that are hydrophobic, flame retardant, anti-static, or otherwise tailorable, afford opportunities to meet a number of needs in the manufacturing sector. The innovation?s success hinges on a monomer production process that utilizes an inexpensive electrochemical conversion that operates near 100% efficiency and that only uses water as a reactant and electricity as an energy source. In addition, the monomer production process is insensitive to the feedstock source and the impurities present in fermentation broths. Therefore, separation and purification is only required after monomer production, resulting in huge cost savings. Laboratory-tested samples of hydrophobic nylon perform equally well as dry nylon, but without the disadvantage of moisture sensitivity. This project will enable Sumatra Biorenewables to transition to a continuous flow, kilogram-scale, production process and supply potential customers with samples for performance testing.

    This SBIR Phase I project takes a deeper look at the concept of 'purpose' and its relationship to the marketplace, unemployment, and start-up incubators. It intends to develop a multi-question self-assessment tool to help individuals find meaningful purpose through free, online, live and self-paced hybrid course instruction. The coursework will use augmented reality and 3-D video to motivate individuals to re-think purpose as a central motivation to employment and entrepreneurship. This project aligns with the NSF?s mission to advance national health, prosperity, and welfare with science and technology. These outcomes could potentially generate a new generation of business owners that are dedicated to meaning and money through a double bottom-line approach to entrepreneurship.

    This project combines the educational work of finding purpose through self- help and the technology of 3-D video and augmented reality for the first time. This unique project provides free online live synchronous education combined with hybrid self-paced online course work to help individuals find meaningful self-employment solutions. This project utilizes a proprietary training method designed to quickly help individuals find their purpose in life and invent a useful business or nonprofit to solve problems in the world. This research can help students re-center their motivations to chart a meaningful life course through a business or nonprofit start-up. The curriculum starts with this activity and extends to provide students an opportunity to enter the marketplace through micro-enterprise or nonprofit creation. The courses will utilize predictive analytics to synthesize student data (such as the answers each student inputs for the four questions in the purpose activity). The data will be reorganized and automated into a clear and targeted purpose proposition statement for the student.

    the commercial viability of using new non-precious metal catalysts to produce
    hydrogen by splitting water.  Electrolyzers made with these new catalysts have
    the potential to deliver higher efficiencies and lower capital costs than currently
    available systems. The market for hydrogen today is $115 billion per year.  Currently,
    hydrogen is primarily produced via steam reformation of methane. Hydrogen production
    via steam reformation emits millions of tons of CO2 into the atmosphere annually.
    There is broad agreement that water electrolysis can play a significant role in
    future hydrogen production if cost reductions can be realized.  In addition, hydrogen
    has the potential to store energy produced by renewable energy systems like solar
    and wind and make it available on demand. The initial market entry point for these
    new electrolyzers is to supply hydrogen for fuel cell powered forklifts used in
    material handling. A life cycle cost analysis by the National Renewable Energy
    Laboratory (NREL) has shown that the total life cycle costs of hydrogen fuel cell
    forklifts are 10% cheaper than those using lead acid batteries. \n\nThe intellectual
    merit of this project is focused on the ability of new earth-abundant non-precious
    metal catalysts for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution
    reaction (OER) to dramatically lower costs while improving efficiency in water
    splitting. The HER electrocatalyst is composed of hyper-thin FeS2 nano-discs and
    the OER electrocatalyst is nanoamorphous Ni0.8:Fe0.2 oxide. The preferred operating
    pH for the catalysts are different (pH 7 for the hyper-thin FeS2 nano-discs and
    pH 14 for the nanoamorphous Ni0.8:Fe0.2 oxide). Preliminary data shows that these
    two catalysts with the dual-pH membrane can effectively split water with a total
    overpotential of only 300 mV (1.53 V in a two electrode configuration). This is
    more than 50 mV lower than the best-known precious metal catalysts, Pt and IrOx,
    used in current commercial electrolyzers. The project will continue the optimization
    of these catalysts in the dual-pH electrolyzer stack and also determine if stability
    and lifetime meet commercial requirements\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I is the improvement of public transportation services for people with disabilities, specifically people with visual impairments. Individuals with visual impairments are heavily dependent on public transit as an essential service for engaging in daily life and social activities. However, they often face challenges with (1) determining which bus to board, especially at busy bus stops when multiple buses approach, and (2) boarding the correct bus in a timely fashion before they leave the stop. By developing an advanced notification service for alerting bus drivers, SeeingBus will address the societal and market needs to mitigate these challenges and thereby promote independent use of public transportation among people with visual impairments. Improving accessibility of public transportation to people with disabilities along with enhancing perception of their service will boost ridership resulting in increased revenue for agencies. The project will contribute to the scientific community as well as society in general by advancing understanding of Smart City services needed for independent travel of people with disabilities.

    The proposed project will develop and commercialize a Smart City service to improve public transportation for people with visual impairments. The service, SeeingBus, provides an advanced notification to bus drivers about users waiting at their next stop. People with visual impairments often miss buses due to challenges they face with boarding the correct bus. SeeingBus aims to improve accessibility of public transportation by engaging bus drivers even before the bus arrives at the stop where riders with visual impairments are waiting. As part of the smart city vision, SeeingBus will enhance connectivity of public transportation systems through greater communication between riders, bus stops, and bus drivers by means of smart sensors. Using big data, SeeingBus alerts bus drivers about users with disabilities, so the drivers can assist individuals in boarding the bus safely. The research objective of this project is to develop and test the feasibility of the SeeingBus system. Advancing public transportation, essential to promoting the travel and independence of individuals, aligns with the NSF mission to advance prosperity and welfare through scientific advancements.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to enable accurate electronic health record (EHR)-based studies to support precision medicine. The country is embarking on a journey of using real world evidence (RWE) to adjust the existing standard of care. EHR-based subgroup analytics and comparative effectiveness studies will increasingly be used to augment regulatory and reimbursement approval. These efforts require accurately recognizing clinical outcomes in real world scenarios. Studies attempting to identify real world outcomes, such as pain and disease free survival, have shown low accuracy rates in claims and EHR discrete data. This proposal aims to accurately detect challenging outcomes from EHR data using advanced semantic technologies. The goal is to enable accurate RWE studies to achieve safer and more effective use of RWE in clinical practice.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to create an application to extract clinical outcomes from real world data to enable EHR-based pragmatic clinical trials (PCTs). The approach uses natural language processing (NLP) to dive deep into the health record for exposure, intervention, and outcome data that do not exist or are inaccurate in claims and EHR discrete data. Project objectives include extracting features from clinical data using NLP and ontologic mapping, developing a knowledge database that reflects common outcomes in observational and clinical trials, and inferring outcome from extracted features using clinical data. The project will validate the outcome detection engine using de-identified longitudinal clinical data to assess accuracy of feature extraction and inferred outcome.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research
    (SBIR) project is significant as it offers a disruptive new mechanical approach to stroke
    treatment. Each year, 795,000 strokes occur in the U.S., 1.7 million strokes in Europe, and
    nearly 20.5 million strokes worldwide. This public-private partnership is expected to have an
    important positive societal impact on the community by saving lives especially the elderly and
    decreasing the economic burden of stroke on the taxpayer. This life-saving device has a unique
    value proposition for health-systems with lower inventory costs from a single size device, and
    for patients with better vessel re-opening rates, thereby saving brain cells. This textile-based
    braided retrievable stent, also known as an embolus retriever or thrombectomy-assist device is
    an innovation that will enhance scientific and technological understanding of how personalized
    medicine can transform the care of stroke patients in the U.S. and worldwide.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to bring to market the industry?s longest blood clot
    or embolus retriever for removal of short and long clots that can be customized by the operator
    based on each patient?s clot burden. In addition, it is the first textile-based braided retrievable
    stent which works well in conjunction with standard catheter-based aspiration systems for stroke
    treatment developed in the U.S. that can be personalized to all clot lengths. Stroke is a major
    problem causing 5.5 million deaths worldwide and currently there is no cost-effective and
    efficacious treatments. The mean lifetime healthcare cost per stroke patient is $140,048. This
    textile-based clot retrieval device (aka thrombectomy-assist device) is a cost-effective medical
    device that can help save a stroke patient?s life. The methods and approaches of this project is
    to compare via pre-clinical tests the ability of a textile-based medical device to re-open vessels
    blocked with clots compared with existing approved treatments. The goals and scope of the
    research will focus on the ability to rapidly re-open vessels that are blocked by clots. This paves
    the way for personalized medicine with a customizable stroke treatment device that can be
    tailored to a patient?s clot burden.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is the commercialization of a fermentation bioprocess that can bring significant benefits for the dairy industry - called the WheyAway system. By initially addressing the problem of handling acid whey, a waste stream generated by all Greek yogurt and cottage cheese producers - the WheyAway can convert the cost of waste handling into a revenue by producing valuable bio-oil platform chemicals. The WheyAway can economically convert the acid whey waste stream to bio-oil on-site, allowing our customers to effectively install biorefineries at each of their plants. In comparison to anaerobic digestion, the WheyAway system can provide several multiples greater economic value. These bio-oils can be used as biofuel feedstocks, animal feed additives, and specialty chemicals. Converting acid whey yields a significant market opportunity with projected impact that could simultaneously offset ~435,000 gallons of diesel used to truck this waste off-site and eliminate ~18,000 tons of greenhouse gases from being emitted to the atmosphere. In the future, this bioprocess can be tuned to address other dairy processing streams, allowing the WheyAway to provide value to stakeholders across the entire dairy production value chain.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to scale-up and optimize a novel fermentation bioprocess called the WheyAway system, and can economically convert acid whey waste into valuable platform chemicals, to provide value to Greek yogurt and cottage cheese producers. Plan is to scale to maximize bio-oil production and conversion efficiency through system optimization. A key focus will be to lower the capital cost for the extraction process. Through the tasks proposed for this SBIR, objectives to scale to a 5x larger reactor, lower operating expense by 20%, and lower the capital cost of the currently expensive bio-oil extraction process by 10x. Additionally, potential to convert other dairy process streams, such as sweet whey, will be evaluated, which could unlock larger opportunities in the dairy production value chain.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to dramatically reduce the incidence of natural gas pipeline failures across the country, within the next 3 to 5 years. Every year there are a few hundred "significant" pipeline accidents (fatalities or significant property damage) causing massive damage to life and property, dispersing hazardous materials and disrupting gas distribution services. These events result in many hundreds of millions of dollars in repair and recovery, and large fines that can be up to a billion dollars or more. This scalable and economical capability will significantly reduce the likelihood of such failures, without requiring additional infrastructure. Performance has been validated at a large utility company, and the prototype has demonstrated the ability to capture a substantial fraction of previously undetected events with significant advance warning (90 minutes or more). This outcome represents a clear performance improvement over existing systems and is enabled by advanced models customized for the gas-utility domain. The methods developed in this project can be directly applied to improve detection accuracy in other contexts such as power-grid networks, computer cluster management and financial fraud detection.

     This SBIR Phase I project proposes to detect anomalies in large-scale gas-utility networks through statistical inference from continuously observed time-series data on pressure, prevailing temperature, and other characteristics of the network. Anomalies within gas-utility networks occur due to a variety of reasons, e.g., sulphur or ice buildup in the pipelines, and corrosion/aging of hardware, and are often preceded by detectable signatures in the time-series of gas-pressure data. A premise of the project is that the early detection of such signatures, leading to advance warning of 90 minutes or more, allows corrective action within the utility network to avoid significant property damage, loss of life, and service disruption. The project proposes new methods for the rapid estimation of short and medium timescale models of gas pressure behavior from voluminous streaming data, along with methods for constructing prediction bands through Monte Carlo and stochastic optimization techniques. Such methods are non-generic and their success relies crucially on exploiting specific structural properties that are unique to network-level gas-pressure time series, along with modern trends in statistical machine learning. The proposed stochastic optimization techniques will probabilistically classify identified anomalies into ``failure type," allowing the prioritizing of network level emergency operations.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is that it holds the promise of significantly reducing the over fertilization of crop fields with poultry litter and at the same time provide poultry farmers with greater profits.  Currently poultry litter (excrement, feathers, bedding and other waste) is used as fertilizer on crop fields. The litter is excessively high in phosphorous which is not well adsorbed by crops and ends up in waterways causing excessive algae growth resulting in dead zones with no aquatic life.  This project expects to prove the practicality of a high efficiency burn system that is low enough in cost to be affordable by individual farmers. The system will burn poultry litter and convert the resulting heat energy to electricity and hot water for heating the farmer's chicken houses. The energy savings will increase farmer's net profits (including the amortized cost of the system) by, on average, 25%.  Thus poultry farmers will be incentivized to eliminate environmentally dangerous poultry litter by converting their farm waste to energy.


    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to design, produce and test a scaled prototype version of the lab test system.  The lab test system is expected to provide burn efficiencies as high as ~97% with particulate emissions well within EPA standards. The scaled system will be designed to process ten times the litter as the lab system.  The primary question this SBIR project will answer is: can the lab results be replicated in a full scale system capable of handling the requirements of an average poultry farm.  The patent pending technology upon which the lab system was designed uses computer controlled fuel (poultry litter) feed rates coupled with a multilevel air injection system to produce optimal efficiency. There are several variables that will be tested to ensure upscaling the size will be successful. These include combustion chamber size and design, air injection locations, pressures and CFM, and fuel feed rates.  Successful commercialization will require optimization of these variables in a full scale system.

    that contains immuno-nutritional properties to address these inefficiencies could
    be considered a game-changer to the industry. Fish are the most resource-efficient

    In addition, SCP also may contain functional properties that improve growth performance
    and survival. The SCP tested previously supported improved feed conversion ratios

    the effect of leading immuno-nutritional candidates on the animals' ability to
    digest more completely inputs like soy bean meal (SBM). The effectiveness of SCPs

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to further the development of a patent pending technology aimed at producing flexible, lightweight, and low-cost semiconductor substrates. These flexible semiconductor films represent the next evolution of the silicon wafer, the foundation of over 90% of today's electronic devices, including computer chips, solar panels, microelectronics, and a wide range of sensors and similar 'internet of things' devices. The silicon wafer, in its current form, is essentially unchanged since its inception over 60 years ago. These wafers, although larger today, remain thick, rigid, fragile, and are limited to circular forms no larger than 450 millimeters (18 inches) in diameter. The ability to produce large-area, high-throughput quantities of this material, in a flexible, more durable format would be truly disruptive, and help to usher in the next generation of affordable, flexible, and pervasive electronic devices. Accelerating the commercialization of this 'wafer 2.0' will help to shape America's high-tech semiconductor manufacturing industry for the 21st century.

    The proposed project will focus on the development of this innovative technology at a simulated roll-to-roll prototyping scale, to enhance film crystal quality, repeatability, and electronic properties, while preparing the process for integration into large scale manufacturing. To date, no techniques exist that can produce large-area, highly crystalline silicon or other semiconductor films, that are suitable for high-throughput manufacturing. The technique in this proposed work is a novel, patent pending process, suitable for high-throughput roll-to-roll manufacturing and has several technical advantages that favor high-uniformity crystallization. Low-cost, flexible, wafer-like substrates will open the door for a wide range of electronic devices and fully integrated system-on-chip designs, including sensors, displays, lighting, processors, memory, microelectronics, and photovoltaics. Specific research activities will include optimization of the crystallization process via exploration of operating parameters; improvements and refinements to the prototype chamber equipment; evaluation of intermediate thin-film layers to provide ideal electronic properties and to promote more favorable recrystallization; and, finally, characterization of the resulting semiconductor films using state of the art semiconductor tools at the world's largest nanotechnology focused institute.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes increased range, increased efficiency, and decreased size of wireless charging systems, which will provide value to consumer devices (e.g., mobile phones and tablets), transportation, and medical industries. In consumer devices, improved and widely adopted wireless power transfer can lead to more rugged designs of the devices by eliminating charging ports, which are a common mode of device failure. Widely adopted wireless charging can improve convenience for consumers, and, with a unified charging solution across a number of devices, eliminate the need for dedicated, device-specific chargers. Increased charging range will increase the number of use cases in all three industries, leading to greater commercial opportunities for this this technology and wireless power transfer in general. In transportation, high-efficiency wireless charging allows for fast charging that is adaptable to varying vehicle heights, which makes electric vehicles more convenient, increases their rate of adoption, and allows charging that is integrated into infrastructure. Increased efficiency reduces the energy costs associated with charging across all three industries.  Furthermore, this project will enhance the scientific understanding of the power handling capabilities of the multilayer self-resonant structure, and the resonant frequencies achievable with various manufacturing techniques.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project addresses the technical challenges keeping a new wireless power transfer coil technology, called the multilayer self-resonant structure (MSRS), from the market.  In order to commercialize the MSRS, the technology must advance beyond a proof-of-concept, and interface with commercial wireless power transfer systems, specifically those that adhere to existing device standards.  The technical hurdles that need to be addressed include 1) reducing the resonant frequency to meet current standards, 2) understanding the power handling limits, and 3) developing electronic interfaces.  These challenges will be overcome by, respectively,  1) building on existing manufacturing techniques used to handle thin layers of material in other industries and adapting them to  develop a scalable manufacturing approach to construct MSRSs with resonant frequencies in the range needed. 2) Analyzing, measuring, and modeling the power handling capabilities of the MSRS.  Finally, 3) Developing impedance matching circuitry required to interface the MSRS with commercial systems. Successful completion of these task will results in a low cost, high-Q wireless power transfer coil, which can be integrated into commercial systems to increase the capable range, efficiency, and power handling of wireless charging.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be the establishment of the analytical framework and software for a global bathymetry mapping system based upon freely available satellite imagery, three independent extraction methods, and ongoing data collection to create geospatial products for a wide range of applications.? Shallow water zones are crucial to the world?s ecology, economy, and culture.  An estimated 70% of the world?s littoral zone is not mapped to modern standards, and traditional methods of mapping these areas are prohibitively expensive and dangerous. Through remote sensing techniques, this innovation will produce detailed bathymetric data for shallow water areas around the globe at far lower costs than traditional methods. This is particularly significant for impoverished remote, low-lying islands which have scarce resources for mapping the natural environment on which their economies heavily rely. ?Additionally, shallow water bathymetry data is vital to geospatial intelligence and to accurately assessing the feasibility and environmental impact of projects relating to global trade/port development, aquaculture, tourism, and resource development.? The results of this innovation will provide a modern baseline of seabed topography for future scientific analysis, change detection, and greater understanding of the marine environment.

    The proposed project addresses the budgetary and health and safety challenges of nearshore bathymetry mapping by advancing three distinct methods of calculating satellite derived bathymetry. These methods rely on different parameters of measurement for water depth retrieval, enabling the advantages of one method to overcome the shortcomings of another. This will create a self-validating method for leveraging advanced remote sensing algorithms in an integrated software platform with ongoing data collection to produce 10-30m resolution bathymetry elevation models.? Extraction methods utilize underwater stereophotogrammetry from multiple overlapping images, wave kinematic detection from multispectral imagery, and measurement of variable attenuation of multispectral signals through the water column.? Research will be conducted on computer vision applications for assessing and allocating images based upon metocean and atmospheric parameters; seafloor spectral segmentation techniques and effects on subsequent multispectral depth retrieval; automation of stereophotogrammetric seafloor target identification and correlation, and integration and automation of wave kinematic derived depth values with multispectral depth retrieval values.? Statistical analysis of resulting data from this combined processing method, evaluated against in situ data for trial locations, will provide direct comparisons for accuracy reporting, algorithm refinements, computational optimization, and determine overall technical and commercial feasibility of future global implementation.?

    is an electrochemical water treatment technology which has the potential for minimizing

    contaminants such as pathogens, toxic organics, and metals in drinking water.
    \ About 80M U.S. homeowners are seeking a water purification solution for fear
    of their water quality. They are unsatisfied with the high maintenance, long-term
    costs, and lack of comprehensive treatment capabilities of existing systems. \n\nThis

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is through providing a sensitive, robust, room temperature operating magnetometer.  Magnetometers are among the most widely used instruments in a variety of applications including healthcare, transportation safety, food contamination monitoring, and homeland security. In fact, the growing need for magnetic field sensors manifests itself in the $1.6 billion global market with a fast-growing medical segment. As for today, the maximum sensitivity is provided by the Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices. The high sensitivity is critically important for medical applications.  However, this high sensitivity can be achieved in the superconducting devices only at cryogenic temperatures.  The proposed magnetometer based on spin wave interferometer combines high sensitivity with room temperature operation. This combination provides a great improvement in healthcare by reducing the cost of equipment, in transportation safety enhancement by providing more accurate traffic control, and in food safety monitoring by detecting small concentrations of heavy metals.  It will be of great benefit to society to have a magnetometer combining the high sensitivity of superconducting devices and room temperature operation.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the need for sensitive and room temperature operating magnetic field sensors by providing a magnetometer based on spin wave interferometer.  There are different types of magnetic sensors available on the market. As of today, the maximum sensitivity up to attoTesla is provided by the Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices. However, this high sensitivity can be achieved only at cryogenic temperatures. The latter makes superconducting magnetometers expensive and limits its practical application. The proposed magnetometer is based on spin wave interference and free of constraints inherent in superconducting devices. The research objectives encompass the development and demonstration of a compact, non-expensive magnetometer with up to attoTesla sensitivity operating in a temperature range from cryogenic to 560 K.  The outcomes of the proposed research will have an impact on commercial, defense and homeland security applications that need increasingly precise and robust magnetic sensors. The development of compact and high-sensitive magnetometer will be relevant to bio-sensing and bio-medical applications as well.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project covers a myriad of domains including wireless health-care, remote education, supply-chain management, public safety, anti-poverty initiatives, market-places, and entertainment. However, a more immediate work product from this effort is a powerful fully-digital mmWave software defined radio (SDR) platform that will be made available to academic researchers at very affordable rates; this will spur further research and make mmWave testbed experimentation within the reach of lightly-funded academic research groups. The ambitious goal of making this transformative technology the reference design of future mmWave radios represents a massive commercial opportunity which is not limited to the cellular ecosystem (base station, tablets and smartphones), but rather extends to new connected players such as cars, drones, virtual reality (VR) headsets and beyond.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project focuses on the development of millimeter-wave (mmWave) radio technologies for next generation wireless systems. The mmWave frequencies of above 28 GHz are necessary to alleviate the spectrum crunch in the traditional cellular bands, and to make ultra-fast 5th Generation (5G) cellular a reality. However, the uniquely challenging propagation characteristics at these frequencies necessitates the use of transceivers that not only operate over low power budgets, but also deliver the robustness that the cellular ecosystem demands. While existing transceivers allow the radio to look (i.e., transmit or receive) in only one direction or a small number of directions at a time, the proposed transceiver design allows the radio to look in all directions simultaneously. While seemingly simple, this unique ability - combined with a top-down implementation ? will provide enormous benefits to cellular systems at reasonable power budgets. The proposed technology forms the key technological bridge between the theoretical promise of mmWave and actually achieving it in the real world.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to increase the returns of grain storage for farmers and reduce overall postharvest loss due to toxin and insect damage.  Ten billion bushels, over half of US grains, are stored on-farm each year for 3-12 months.  During this period, grain is susceptible to spoilage, infestation, and moisture loss?all of which impacts the price a farmer receives at the time of market delivery.  There is no easy way to monitor grain quality changes throughout the storage season to optimize for best times to run aeration controls to preserve, condition or maintain the grain.  This leaves farmers with a ?gut check? system of driving to each grain bin site and climbing up and inside units.  Since grain is priced based on moisture baselines, farmers are essentially selling water and weight, their final price outcome can vary significantly based on how well they managed grain conditions throughout the storage period.  In the US, an annual $3 to $ 5 billion dollars (3 ? 5%) of crop value is lost due to toxin, insect and moisture mismanagement that could be prevented through the introduction of affordable and accessible monitoring technology.

    The proposed project would advance internet of things automation and wireless sensor applications as applied to production agriculture and the postharvest supply chain.  There are certain, manual processes of farm production that are strenuous due to time burdens and the lack of obtainable information to make decisions.  Monitoring grain assets, the product of farmers? toil and the safety net of global food supply, in farm bins, commercial storage, and barges is one such process. Sensing for when loss and spoilage risks occur, but more importantly connecting and turning the data into automation opportunities before they exist is the aim of this proposal.  Cable-based monitoring solutions exist, but adoption is restricted due to physical installation limitations, electricity/power constraints, and investment costs.  This project will validate the feasibility of a low-power, wireless sensor that can detect grain conditions and last a full postharvest cycle (18 months).  Such a device will create opportunities to track grain qualities across the agriculture value chain, beginning with its use to monitor and automate farm grain storage.  By characterizing, and testing against cable systems and within grain science 3D models, this project will prove the wireless sensor?s direct functionality within this first farm application.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will be to develop a preclinical drug characterization platform capable of profiling the effect of a drug candidate on whole protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. PPIs play a pivotal role in most diseases, and are considered high-impact therapeutic targets for cancers, autoimmune diseases, infectious diseases, and more. Over 40 clinically relevant PPIs have been disrupted successfully with small molecules, and several have entered clinical trials. One recently approved cancer drug, Venetoclax, is expected to reach $2.2B in sales by 2020. Despite the enormous clinical and commercial potential of PPI disrupting drugs, preclinical characterization remains a major challenge. Pharmaceutical companies are limited by slow and laborious techniques to measure protein interactions that require each protein to be purified, and each PPI to be measured separately. As a result, only a small subset of relevant interactions are tested during preclinical drug development, which leads to a high incidence of failure during clinical trials. The proposed platform for PPI network characterization is expected to have a major commercial and societal impact by enabling more thorough preclinical screening of PPI inhibiting drugs, reducing the overall cost and time associated with drug development.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop and commercialize a novel platform for screening PPI disrupting drugs that provides quantitative accuracy, enables simultaneous characterization of whole PPI networks, and eliminates the need for protein purification. This platform combines the throughput of a cell-based assay with the accuracy of a bioanalytical technique by linking yeast haploid mating efficiency to the affinity of proteins displayed on the cells' surfaces. Preliminary results demonstrate that next generation sequencing of diploid cells may be used to accurately measure many PPI strengths simultaneously. The goal of this project is to demonstrate that the proposed platform can correctly recapitulate whole disease-relevant PPI networks and accurately characterize well-studied inhibitors in a format that is compatible with existing high-throughput screening workflows. To demonstrate feasibility, the well-studied BCL2 PPI network, which contains unstable proteins and considerable complexity, will be analyzed to identify each pairwise PPI and compared to known interactions from the literature. The yeast strains and assay parameters will then be optimized for screening water insoluble small molecule drugs and 96-well plate compatibility. The ultimate goal of this project is to establish a new platform technology for the preclinical characterization of PPI inhibiting drug candidates.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the creation of flexible passenger identification displays for ride-hailing and automotive applications. This is a distinct pain point as many drivers choose the same model cars. Our first application is to solve ride-hailing passenger identification, but this becomes more critical with autonomous vehicles -- the only method of visual communication between an autonomous car and its target passenger will be via display. By helping to enable autonomous fleets of service vehicles, our displays will impart significant societal benefits, including reduced emissions, improved mobility for the elderly and disabled, and fewer traffic accidents. Beyond automotive, researchers estimate that in 2017 there are 20 billion devices connected to the Internet that are not computers, growing to 125 billion by 2025. These will influence many areas, including health and wellness, factory production, public safety, retail, agriculture, homes, and offices. They will enable better resource allocation, predictive maintenance, operations management, worker training, task automation, energy management, and safety. Not all of these ?Internet of Things? devices need displays, but those that do use them for input and information relay ? the exact uses for which our displays are designed.

    The proposed project will develop roll-to-roll printed passive matrix OLED (PMOLED) display technology. PMOLED displays are built upon a patterned transparent conductive anode that defines the pixels. To date, the only method used in industry to create this anode is photolithography. This is a slow and expensive batch process, but it is the only method that can produce the required results. Our high-resolution printable anode replaces both the incumbent material and the lithographic process to create a continuous roll of plastic covered in OLED anodes that can be loaded into a printing press. This lays the foundation for fully printed displays, fabricated using flexography, the same technique used to print newspapers. Through this work, we will produce fully printed PMOLED display prototypes. These thin, flexible displays will have extremely high contrast while using only 20% of the power required by a backlit LCD, with wide viewing angles for easy readability and flexibility to conform to any surface. If successful, we will be able to print displays 1000 times faster than the industry standard throughput while reducing materials waste by 80%. Such cost savings will make our displays the obvious choice for information display use, especially in design-driven applications.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) project is the development of an effective and sustainable alternative
    to antibiotics and biocides used in animal feed, which will help mitigate the
    global health threat of multidrug-resistant bacteria. The beef cattle industry
    is under increasing regulatory and public pressure to reduce or eliminate the
    use of antibiotic feed additives as they are considered a major factor driving
    the proliferation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. However, in-feed antibiotics
    provide significant economic and animal welfare benefits to the cattle industry
    by reducing the incidence and severity of liver abscesses. This project provides
    an alternative for these conflicting concerns by providing a cost-effective alternative
    to in-feed antibiotics. Further, with sufficient understanding of how the rumen
    microbiome impacts animal physiology and performance, this technology could be
    easily adapted to selectively target microbial species that reduce animal growth
    or feed efficiency, or that produce methane, increasing the economic and environmental
    sustainability of livestock agriculture. \n\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes
    to develop a low-dose, bacteriophage-based feed additive that can be prophylactically
    administered to control the growth of pathogenic Fusobacterium necrophorum in
    cattle rumen. F. necrophorum is a causative agent of liver abscesses in grain-fed
    cattle, and antibiotics are currently added to feed to prevent its growth and
    limit abscess occurrence. However, in-feed antibiotics promote the proliferation
    of antibiotic resistant bacteria, and can cause undesirable off-target effects
    to the rumen microbiome. This research seeks to develop broad host-range (polyvalent)
    bacteriophages as an economical means of controlling cattle pathogens. Polyvalent
    bacteriophages will be isolated using specialized methods that select for those
    with a predetermined host-range based on rumen microbial composition. Each bacteriophage
    will then be characterized and tested for efficacy within a bioreactor operated
    to simulate the cattle rumen. Bacteriophage cocktails will be formulated and tested
    for their ability to minimize the development of bacteriophage resistance. The
    expected outcome of the proposed research is a library of polyvalent bacteriophages
    that can effectively control F. necrophorum under rumen-like conditions, and which
    will be further tested in animal studies.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory
    mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's

    This SBIR Phase I project aims to demonstrate the technical feasibility of a first-of-its-kind injectable gel for treating osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis, a disease of the body's joints, affects greater than 27 million Americans, and the proposed activity will de-risk the proprietary gel technology to warrant continued development of a medical device for treating osteoarthritis. The product is a bioinspired polymer gel solution, to be administered by injection into the joint, which will lubricate, cushion, and protect the joint's cartilage from wear, and thereby slow the progression of osteoarthritis. Upon successful completion of this project, the company aims to complete the preclinical and clinical studies required to gain regulatory approval for the product emanating from the proposed activity. From this project, a deeper fundamental understanding of body-biomaterial interactions will be gained, benefiting engineers, clinicians, and ultimately patients. The anticipated commercial success of this product will result in job creation both before and after completion of product development. As joint pain is one of the leading causes of missed work, disability, and general depreciation of quality of life, successful completion of the proposed high-technical-risk project will lay the foundation for development of an impactful medical device which will treat the highly prevalent disease osteoarthritis.

    The innovation of this project's technology lies in the patented synthetic techniques and composition of a tissue-protective gel solution that remains in the joint capsule at therapeutic concentrations for significantly longer than current injectable gels remain. All injectable viscoelastics approved in the United States for treating osteoarthritis are comprised of hyaluronic acid, a biopolymer which degrades rapidly upon injection; in contrast, the product in this project uses a synthetic, bioinspired polymer which resists degradation and maintains effective viscoelastic properties for four months, whereas current products' viscoelasticity is degraded after one week. The project's first objective will, through a radiolabeled biodistribution study, ascertain the gel's distribution throughout the body following injection into rodent knees, to demonstrate 100% clearance out of the animal and no accumulation within any tissues or organs. The project's second objective will develop the material processing techniques and syringe filling protocol for formulating the gel into its final product form and ensuring product performance and safety specifications are met. Completion of these objectives will allow product to be made under FDA-compliant Design Control for a pivotal large animal study to be conducted following this project, along with completion of formal biocompatibility testing for submission to FDA to seek approval for a First-in-Human clinical trial.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is the development of yeast fermentation technologies that enable conversion of sugars abundant in pectin-rich agricultural waste into useful specialty chemicals. The U.S. is a leading producer of pectin-rich agricultural wastes including citrus peels (>5 million tons annually), sugar beets (>37 million tons annually), and grape pomace (>1 million tons annually). These peel and pulp byproducts lack value, however, the proposed technologies developed in this project will allow for significantly higher valued products to be produced from these waste streams. The initial target chemical product is used as a chelator in cleaning products and a precursor to plastics. Other chemical products potentially may be produced using this platform. Implementation of this fermentation process offers a lower carbon footprint and emissions compared to petroleum or even other sugar-derived products, and has impact in reducing waste and combating climate change. When implemented at scale, these fermentation processing plants will be co-located with rural agricultural processing plants, adding high-tech jobs in these areas, and offering a means to de-risk historically volatile crop harvests by accessing alternative markets.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to engineer yeast strains capable of converting sugars in pectin-rich agricultural wastes into valuable specialty chemicals. Currently, the fermentation rates for utilizing the primary sugar in pectin, D-galacturonic acid, limits production of these chemicals, including the proposed first product, which is a biodegradable metal chelator. Previous characterization has identified that uptake of the pectin sugars by a transporter as the limiting step. Accordingly, the first objective of this proposal is to characterize this class of transporter to identify new transporters with improved rates. The second objective is to improve the best transporter through protein engineering. Using this improved transporter, the final objective will assess the cellular energy requirements for the fermentation process using bioreactors to control fermenter conditions, as product synthesis and transport is energy-demanding. If successful, this project will enable production of specialty chemicals from pectin-rich agricultural waste.

    Research (SBIR) project is in the development of new technologies to manufacture
    personalized therapies for cancer and other diseases that are based on a patient's
    own cells.  Such therapies have shown remarkable success in recent years, however,
    manufacturing these therapies is challenging because mass production techniques
    cannot be employed when each patient receives a unique therapy.  Indeed, for therapies
    based on dendritic cells, which are an important part of the human immune system,
    there are no manufacturing systems currently available that can perform all of
    the required steps.  This project will address this major unmet need by leveraging
    advanced concepts in engineering and biology to design an integrated system for
    cost-effective manufacturing of dendritic cell therapies.  Given the large number
    of personalized cell-based therapies currently in clinical trials, and recently
    approved therapies, such a system is expected to address a major societal need
    and have significant commercial potential.  \n\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes
    to develop a manufacturing system to cover the steps involved in the manufacturing
    of autologous dendritic cell therapies.  Because of the low abundance of these
    cells in blood, dendritic cells are typically generated from blood-derived monocytes.
    \ Following differentiation of monocytes into dendritic cells, these cells are
    then matured and stimulated with tumor-specific antigens.  These steps represent
    discrete unit operations that require a system capable of handling both adherent
    and non-adherent cell types, different reagents for each step, and the ability
    to transition from one step to another with minimal loss of cells.  Further, all
    steps must be performed in a disposable single-use enclosure.  In order to achieve
    automation and integration of these steps, the proposed system will leverage innovations
    in perfusion-based dendritic cell culture and novel and cost-effective bioreactor
    design strategies.  A combination of computational modeling and rapid-prototyping
    techniques will be employed for rapid iteration of prototypes and testing with
    potential users involved in therapeutic development.  Successful completion of
    this project will result in feasibility demonstration of an integrated manufacturing
    system developed with significant end user feedback.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to provide the capability to affordably and reliably connect underserved or unserved Americans to high speed internet using surface-mounted optical fiber, whether they live in a suburban neighborhood or in a remote rural area. The lack of high speed internet access is largely due to an inability to economically distribute broadband communications over the 'last mile' to businesses, homes, schools, and medical or government entities. An understanding of the installed durability of fiber using this technique will usher in new developments to deploy surface-mounted fiber nationwide. More accessible high-speed internet provides more information, opportunity, and economic productivity regardless of the locale. The digital divide between urban and rural Americans could be reduced or eliminated. Lower cost fiber deployments will make it easier to deploy new technologies, like 5G antennas and connected vehicles, and will shrink the cost to make cities smarter with ubiquitous sensors and cameras.

    The proposed project will demonstrate that optical fibers under protective coatings bonded to paved surfaces can provide reliable high speed communications while subjected to weather and traffic. It will allow estimation of the predicted life time of surface mounted fiber on pavement. The testing will place asphalt samples in an environmental test chamber to evaluate competing fiberoptic installations and to identify the best performers for a series of follow-on field and lab tests. This will allow the future targeting of financial resources on the most promising material and profile combinations. Test samples will undergo wide ranging temperature and humidity cycles and repetitive tire impacts under controlled conditions. This testing will identify statistical life predictions in years after only a few months of actual test time. The longer the predicted life, the larger the customer pool, and the wider the potential market penetration. Understanding the predicted lifetime of a fiber installation will open the door to more early adopters, to more pilot program users, and eventually to fiberoptic installers and long term customers.

    This SBIR Phase I project is dedicated to producing software that makes it easy for people with special needs, especially those on the autism spectrum, to compose their own music. A wide base of evidence shows that music can be a powerful emotional and creative outlet for people with disabilities. Multiple studies show that music can help children on the autism spectrum improve their skills in social interaction, verbal communication,initiating behavior, and social-emotional reciprocity. However, public access to music education has declined dramatically in the United States over the last 40 years. The 6.6 million students in the US with special needs face further barriers to music education because of the significant financial resources and demanding degree of physical dexterity required by instrument lessons. Within this context, private sector innovation is more necessary than ever to increase the accessibility of music education. By offering affordable and intuitive software this project has the potential to make a major impact on the economy by helping to reduce education and health care costs for parents of children with special needs, school special education programs, and adults with disabilities. Just as importantly, democratizing the joy of musical creativity will make a powerful contribution to unlocking the passion, talents, and productivity of people with special needs.


    To make it easy for people with special needs to make their own music, this project will employ gestural composition, responsive design, and data science to produce a software interface that adapts to a users' accessibility preferences based on their previous interactions with the program. A second focus of the project is to produce interactive music lessons focused on self-expression and socio-emotional intelligence. Lessons will utilize and expand upon the creative interface to guide users to write songs that express their mood. Robust user testing and intelligent application of machine learning will be required to ensure that the interface smoothly evolves to enable user creativity. Considerable experimentation will also be required to build lessons which strike a balance between supporting users through linear instruction and empowering users to make expressive decisions and take ownership of their emotions. To mitigate the project's technical risk special needs experts and health professionals will be consulted at every stage of user testing and development. In sum, these innovations address the significant and urgent challenge of opening music up as a medium of creativity, communication and self-expression for people with special needs, especially those on the autism spectrum.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project views an IoT firearms detection system in the lens of the military due to their immediate need of such a device and associated data. In addition, a foothold in the military will allow for and influence the adoption in downstream markets such as private security and law enforcement who have already expressed interest in piloting and adopting this technology once fully developed. However, the broader goal and impact of this system more importantly grants the potential to save lives. Whether this system will be used in the military, law enforcement, or private citizens in cases of home and self defense, successful implementation and commercialization of the first firearms detection system will grant the capabilities to objectively monitor and leverage firearm usage data.

    The proposed project aims to research, develop, and commercialize an integrated IoT system dedicated to detecting and processing small arms firearm discharges. The challenge in achieving the goals of this project is two-fold: one to create an IoT system that satisfies the stringent and high standards of the customer and two, to create value within the data collected by these IoT sensors. The proposed research and development covers the creation of a prototype device as well as generating a roadmap based on product and user feedback towards effective use of the data to ensure commercial success.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in improving the quality of general and task lighting and reducing the amount of wasted light, thus reducing energy consumption. Solid state lighting has caused a paradigm shift in the lighting industry. However, the rapid growth of the LED has surpassed our understanding of its effects on human health and productivity, as well as the environment. Developing systems that put light only where it is needed can reduce energy consumption and improve well-being by eliminating glare and wasted light. Full control over where artificial lights shine may also reduce the disruption of natural ecosystems and agriculture caused by light pollution.? Unfortunately, a compact and low-cost solution to spatially controllable illumination is not available. Should one be brought to market, the industry could be tailored to meet the needs of each street lamp, each office worker and the entertainment industry among others. The ubiquitous nature of artificial illumination provides a unique commercial opportunity with multiple market segments for growth potential.

    The proposed project will focus on a microsystems solution to steerable lighting using a low-power, low-cost, silicon-based mirror less than 1 mm in diameter. The mirror is capable of real-time adjustments that will steer incident light with significant angular range. It is controlled using digital electronics and easily combined with traditional smart home electronics. The objective of the research is to measure the optical output of varying system setups and optical components to determine what optics are necessary for proper light output shape, uniformity, and color temperature. The project will rely heavily on a combination of test measurements and simulations to cycle through experiments rapidly and efficiently in order to converge on a manufacturing plan.

    Research (SBIR) project is the development of a microalgae-based commercial hydrogen
    production process that will surpass current or developing technologies. By 2022,
    the global hydrogen generation market by value is projected to reach $154.7 billion.
    A technology for low-cost, high purity, renewable, scalable hydrogen production
    will accelerate transition to a hydrogen economy, thus facilitating domestic energy
    independence and creating new economic opportunities. Many industries, such as
    the petro-chemical, chemical, and electronics industries, would benefit from low
    cost industrial hydrogen. Transportation and electric power generation industries
    also would benefit from increased fuel efficiency. Environmental benefits include
    replacement of fossil fuels, switching hydrogen production from natural gas to
    sunlight and water, and substantial reduction of harmful emissions. The goal of
    this project is to incorporate proprietary, metabolically engineered, photosynthetic
    algae in combination with recent advances in bioprocessing and hardware engineering
    to manufacture clean, renewable hydrogen. \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research
    Phase I project proposes to develop microalgae strains that generate high hydrogen
    yields using a novel metabolic engineering strategy. To pursue this strategy,
    a suitable parental strain must be developed, combining intact hydrogen production
    genes with improved stability of introduced genes (transgenes). Despite the availability
    of genetic transformation methods, transgene stability in wild type strains remains
    poor. This seriously limits development of commercial strains. Two algal UV mutants
    with greatly improved transgene stability are available, but both have impaired
    hydrogen production genes. The proposed investigation will assess the feasibility
    of creating a suitable parental strain. The objectives are: 1) determine differences
    between genes of the best wild type hydrogen producing strain and the UV mutants;
    2) introduce candidate genes into the UV mutants to restore hydrogen production
    metabolism; 3) knock out candidate genes involved in transgene inactivation in
    the wild type strain; and 4) test the ability of the engineered strains to generate
    hydrogen and retain transgenes. This project will produce the desired parental
    strain and enable implementation of the innovative strategy for developing production
    strains with greatly increased hydrogen rates in the target commercial process.\n\nThis

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to develop protein purification technology that will provide access to inexpensive, purified proteins for biological and life science applications by removing the purification bottleneck in biopharmaceutical production, and leveraging the innovative breakthroughs in protein engineering and gene editing.  Scale-up of this technology will transform the large-scale purification of biopharmaceuticals and lower prescription drug costs - the most important factor contributing to rising healthcare costs.  The major factor influencing the rising cost of healthcare is the skyrocketing costs of pharmaceuticals - up to 40% of the medical plan cost will be drugs by 2025.  Prescription drug costs are the fastest rising component of healthcare and are contributing to the dramatic increase in healthcare costs.  The worldwide focus of pharmacy and biotechnology is now on biopharmaceutical development and production to address this issue.  Direct benefits of this project include low-cost, use of green reagents, and the absence of heavy metal impurities in the purified protein.  In addition, the development of immobilized enzymes using this technology will open new frontiers in biocatalysis, biosensors, diagnostics and protein delivery.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop protein purification kits for small-scale and research-scale research. Bringing these kits to market will enable researchers to further validate the technology on a broader range of proteins in preparation for scale-up for biopharmaceutical production.  Synthetic biology has quickly begun to revolutionize drug discovery and design by providing a better overall molecular understanding of disease.  However, this potential has yet to be fully realized due to the challenges associated with purifying the target recombinant protein from the thousands of naturally-occurring proteins produced by the expression system.  The three specific aims of the project are: 1) validation of protein tag performance for multiple protein classes and expression systems, 2) development of low-cost methods for protein tag removal from purified proteins, and 3) development of solutions for the purification of low-expressing proteins and the parallel purification of small amounts of proteins.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer(STTR) project is to develop a bio-based manufacturing process for glucaric acid and its intermediate, glucuronic acid. Microbial fermentation represents an attractive option for production of fuels and valuable chemicals from renewable resources, and glucaric acid can be produced from glucose, a renewable biomass-derived resource.  The glucaric acid market was estimated at $550M in 2016, and has a plethora of uses ranging from detergents to food ingredients, corrosion inhibitors, and de-icing applications.  The proposed project will engineer improved productivity of the microbe using C5/C6 sugars, thus accelerating the production of low-cost, high-purity glucaric acid. Achieving these bioprocess improvements will facilitate widespread adoption of bio-based glucaric acid in a variety of markets, broadening opportunity for US products. These applications include coatings, foams and foaming aids, electrolytes, gels, polymers, and polymer additives.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to perform multi-omics studies to characterize the physiology of E. coli strains producing glucaric acid via fermentation, and develop strain engineering strategies to enable high yield and productivity. Most fermentation products are highly reduced compared to the starting sugar, and care must be taken to maintain cells in a reduced state, meaning high NADH/NAD ratio, to drive the NADH-consuming biosynthetic reactions. Products that are derived from sugar oxidation, in contrast, pose a much different challenge, and have been explored to a much lesser extent. Here, additional oxygen is needed to accept the excess electrons generated during glucose oxidation. It is well known that both S. cerevisiae and E. coli, two of the most common organisms for industrial application, are limited in their electron transport chain capacity, resulting in overflow products from high glucose uptake rates. Regardless of the oxygen transfer ability of the fermentation equipment, there is an inherent maximum production rate of these organisms. In this project, the plan is to develop E. coli strains with increased respiration capacity, thus increasing the maximum glucose oxidation rate. Glucaric acid, which can be produced from glucose via 3 enzymatic reaction steps, is an exemplary product.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to create sustainable and biodegradable polyurethane products made from algae oils. Algae-based polymer precursors will be developed and used to produce finished polyurethane product with the desired physical characteristics. Development of polyurethane shoe soles will be targeted, including polyurethane flip-flops, as these are products where consumers are increasingly demanding the incorporation of sustainable materials and where the consumer is willing to pay the small extra cost associated with incorporating renewable materials. Developing algae polymers and high value products made from these will allow us to develop a novel monomer toolbox based on these bio-materials and to create new polymers with physical properties equal or superior to petroleum based polymers. These algae based polymers also provide cleaner, smarter products- pollution prevention at the molecular level. The development of environmentally sustainable and biodegradable products will reduce waste, prevent costly end-of-life remediation, lead to safer products and save energy and water resources. The development of these algae based polymer products will enable renewable materials to supplant petroleum-based materials while maintaining the performance characteristics of polyurethane products that consumers have come to appreciate.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop sustainable monomers from bio-based algae feedstocks that will be used to create finished polyurethane soft foams that have the appropriate properties for shoe soles. It incorporates the preparation of algae-based polyols from multiple algae oil sources, going from bench to production scale, followed by formulation of these monomers into materials that meet the demands of a discerning eco-conscious consumer. The developed algae polyols will not be formulaic direct drop-in replacements for the corresponding petroleum sourced materials' careful formulation will be required to generate polyurethanes with the desired final product properties, and that are also compatible with current manufacturing techniques. Formulation and process compatibility are key steps, as industrial users are not looking to significantly modify manufacturing processes to incorporate new starting materials. Lastly, physical evaluation of the resulting polyurethanes will be done by comparing the performance metrics between bio and petroleum-based polyurethanes typically used by end users in sportswear and automotives. Using polyols derived from multiple algal strains, a polyurethane formulation for soft foams will be developed to demonstrate our ability to integrate product development and manufacturing, from sustainable feedstock and green chemistry through commercial application.

    This SBIR Phase I project will develop an extended depth imaging variation of optical coherence tomography (OCT). OCT is an optical imaging method that can visualize tissue structures up to 1mm deep with microscopic resolution. It has been well adapted for retinal imaging but although available for skin imaging application, the performance and price point are not sufficient to encourage market adoption. Building on NSF supported research at Duke University, this project will extend the depth range of OCT from the current 1-2 mm, which is only the most superficial layer of skin, to 3-4 mm, enabling full imaging of skin layers down to the dermal junction. This will enable dermatologists to access OCT without a large financial outlay and provide a non-invasive imaging modality in the office setting.

    Extended depth imaging is also applicable to dental imaging and may allow dentists to reduce the need for X-ray imaging by providing cross sectional images of teeth and gums. Since these OCT instruments are highly portable, the deep imaging system can be widely used, across lab benches, in the field or shared throughout a medical office. This project will support the development of new products and the teams that design and build them. Extended depth imaging OCT uses a novel design to dramatically increase the depth penetration of OCT into skin, teeth and other samples. By using distinct illumination and collection apertures, extended depth (or dual axis) OCT can triangulate the signal to layers deep beneath the tissue surface. Compared to previous OCT systems, this increases the imaging depth by a factor of 2. This innovation will be combined with proprietary spectrometer design, which was developed to take advantage of 3D printing methods, to develop a disruptive new instrument for imaging with the performance and price necessary for commercial success in clinical dermatology and dentistry. This proposal will build a prototype system and test it on several types of animal tissue.

    Research (SBIR) project entails alleviation of a human eye condition that has
    obscured the scientific community for almost a century. Refractive eye error is
    the most pervasive condition affecting the ocular health of the U.S. population,
    across all ethnicities. Presbyopia, a widespread form of such refractive error,
    affects 125 million Americans, and over 1.8 billion people worldwide today. It
    is caused by reduction of focusing and re-focusing ability of the human eye lens
    with natural aging. The symptoms range from blurred vision, haziness, and eye
    strain to headaches, which are sometimes severe enough to affect the quality of
    life and work ability of subjects. Since the early 1900s, presbyopia has been
    traditionally treated with fixed power multi-focal and progressive eyeglasses
    that do not solve the core problem of age-related loss of accommodative ability.
    The principal goal of this SBIR work is development of key high performance tunable
    Smart Eyeglasses with good stability and restoration algorithms that will help
    restore this lost ability. This 21st century device, the world?s first smart auto-focus
    eyewear, will offer personalized full field normal vision restoration to presbyopic
    subjects and generate jobs and revenues worth billions of dollars. \n\nThis SBIR
    Phase I project proposes to implement the feasibility of commercialization of
    21st Century variable power smart eyeglasses that will restore the natural accommodation
    of human eye that is lost to presbyopia due to aging. These adaptive glasses use
    a combination of fluidic lenses with variable power, ultra-light actuators, distance
    sensors, and embedded control electronics to continually produce full-field sharply
    focused view for objects at variable distances. For this proposal, we focus on
    the research and development of two important aspects of these devices which are
    key to a successful commercialization. First, is improving the long-term stability
    of the viscoelastic membranes of these adaptive glasses by using low drift materials
    instead of PDMS, and secondly, incorporating a closed-loop feedback mechanism
    using displacement sensors to account for the correction of drifts resulting from
    the hysteresis and degradation of lens-driving piezo actuators. In the first task,
    our goal is to achieve an optical power drift of less than 120 milli-Diopter/year,
    and in the second task, achieve a drift less than 83 milli-Diopter/year. These
    milestones will result in a lens with drift that is less than 0.25 Diopter over
    its expected 3 year lifetime, critical for a commercial grade eyewear lens.\n\nThis

    on developing a  plasma jet printing technology to serve the printed electronics
    industry. Printed electronic devices including flexible electronics and flexible
    hybrid electronics (FHE) are next generation smart devices that have applications
    in both consumer and industrial segments. These devices combine the flexibility
    and low cost of printed substrates made of plastic with the performance of semiconductor
    devices to create a new category of electronics. The main challenge in FHE is
    integration of semiconductor die to the flexible substrate and interconnects.
    Plasma jet printing has high potential to address the problems associated with
    printed electronics manufacturing, in particular the interconnects. The plasma
    process control allows printing metallic materials with required electronic properties
    by in-situ treatment, thereby eliminating the need for post processing. The global
    market for printed electronics equipment is $1.5 billion in 2017 and is estimated
    to reach $4 billion globally in 2020 and growing at a compound annual growth rate
    of 38%. Immediate industrial application of our technology is in replacing wire

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is a system that provides improved reservoir productivity through a novel, inexpensive, and environmentally friendly method. This method will use an electric impulse to increase reservoir permeability, and decrease industry reliance on alternative methods like hydraulic fracturing, which requires hazardous chemicals to be pumped into the subsurface. Residents in regions where fracking techniques are utilized have commonly been impacted by induced seismicity and landslides as a consequence of pumped in chemicals lubricating faults, making earth ruptures more likely to occur. Additionally, the material and operation time for reservoir stimulation techniques makes the current process expensive. The ability to increase permeability with an electric impulse will avoid the environmental concerns associated with current methods, and will proved a cost competitive reservoir stimulation solution due to a short operational time.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a novel low-frequency impulse method (LFIM) that increases reservoir permeability for petroleum and geothermal applications, without requiring pumping of material into the subsurface. Fluid mobility is increased due to viscosity reduction and reservoir permeability is increased in the direction of interest from the vibrational removal of particles within sediment pores.  This program will 1) simulate the processes taking place in the reservoir using computer simulation model, 2) perform experimental analysis of the effects of the electric treatment on different core samples, and 3) determine applicability of the method to different types of the reservoirs located in the United States.  Therefore, this project will identify the optimum sites, where LFIM can boost geothermal performance and oil & gas production.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is the reuse of rubber compounds from spent tires in high performance products including new tires without significant loss in product performance. Only a very small portion of those tires are currently being ground up for this purpose because of the detrimental impact  on product properties. However, larger quantities could potentially be used if the ground rubber is treated by the process of our invention. This would have several benefits.  Manufacturers could reduce material cost, the rubber recycling industry would enjoy significant growth and unsightly tire dumps with associated pollution problems would disappear. Additionally, the tire industry will become more sustainable and other unacceptable uses of old tires currently practiced, such as their use as fuels in low cost operations, would be financially challenged as novel, more profitable uses that retain the integrity of the polymer matrix emerge.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to build upon studies conducted by our company during the last few years. While it was widely known that recycled ground rubber will significantly reduce physical properties, limited information and understanding existed on the basic causes. Much hope was pinned by many companies and academic institutions on the potential merit of the ground up rubber but no significant commercial process previously emerged. This work aims to develop a recycling process which does not require a devulcanization step. This was first demonstrated with model sample geometries that simulate the environment which ground rubber particles experience when added to and being co-vulcanized with fresh rubber compounds.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop customizable cell/tissue culture platforms using a new class of 3D printable bisphenol A-free polycarbonate (BFP) materials and a rapid 3D printing system. The 3D cell culture market was valued at $683 million in 2017 with an exponential projected growth in revenue valued at $1.7 billion by 2022. The rapid growth in this sector is primarily driven by the demand for custom-made 3D cell/tissue models that more accurately recapitulate the human in vivo biology in comparison to conventional animal models and planar cell culture systems. 3D cell/tissue models have the potential to provide more physiologically relevant responses for the drug discovery industry which is estimated to reach $86 billion in 2022. The proposed strategy of using BFP and a fully integrated benchtop 3D printing system will facilitate the production of different cell/tissue culture platforms on demand and enable rapid iteration of different designs to drive forward the development of more clinically relevant cell/tissue models for a broad market in pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, and biological studies.

    The intellectual merit of this project lies in: (1) the development of novel 3D printable BFP materials with tunable material properties using green chemistry, and (2) the rapid 3D printing of customizable cell/tissue culture prototypes to support various 3D cell/tissue models. The material development will include the establishment of a reagent library and optimization of the green chemistry process. The relevant material properties such as stiffness, elasticity, optical transparency, and small molecule adsorption will be characterized and optimized. These materials will then be printed using a rapid light-based 3D printer to prototype cell/tissue culture platforms followed by evaluation of their performance. In particular, 3D printing precision and resolution will be characterized and optimized by varying a range of fabrication parameters such as light exposure time and intensity. Next, the efficacy of the prototypes under cell culture conditions will be assessed based on device integrity, material degradation, as well as changes in mechanical and optical properties. Various cells/tissues will also be cultured on these prototype devices to evaluate biocompatibility. These achievements will provide customized culture platforms to facilitate the engineering of more physiologically relevant in vitro models for accelerating drug discovery and biological studies in both industry and academia.

    This SBIR Phase I project will develop text, speech and image analysis technologies to transform a set of educational lecture videos into an interactive learning companion. A lecture video will be presented as a series of topically cohesive sections, each represented by a textual summary, a visual summary, and a video segment. Students will be able to query a series of lecture videos with the answers presented as a combination of text, images, speech with transcript, and video, along with links to additional relevant resources. These technological enhancements will drive the development of the lecture video management system with capabilities well beyond commercial state of the art. The students will gain the ability to instantly access any information in a semester long course, with little overhead for the instructor. The business plan focuses on a freemium model designed for wide adoption with no cost to instructors and a very low cost to students. The ultimate potential societal benefit is a significantly better learning experience and learning outcomes for higher education students.


    The key innovations in this project are summarization of video segments and a Questions & Answers (QA) system customized for a series of lecture videos. These are formidable challenges despite existing substantial related research in text mining and image analysis. The information content of a lecture video spans multiple modalities, specifically, screen text, images, and speech. Further, each modality has unique characteristics. Screen text is typically unstructured and includes Optical Character Recognition errors. Transcripts from classroom lecture videos contain informal classroom interactions and suffer from speech recognition errors. The images in a lecture video can represent a variety of concepts including illustrative examples, graphs and charts, and camera images. Innovative approaches to topic modeling will be developed to handle the unique nature of the input compared to most documents. The project will employ representation learning approaches to map from each modality to a common semantic space that will drive the matching between student questions and the content of lecture videos. Since the best answer to a student question may not be fully contained in a lecture video, external resources including textbooks, message boards, and actual quizzes and exams will also be analyzed to drive the QA module.

    the quality of life of patients currently suffering from Parkinson?s Disease (PD).
    \ Over 1 million Americans have been diagnosed with PD and this number is expected
    to double by 2040.  PD is a neurodegenerative disorder without a cure ? once the
    first Parkinsonian tremor has been detected, over 80% of the brain cells associated
    with creating dopamine through natural processes have already died. Dopamine is
    a chemical released by neurons to communicate with other nerve cells and is essential
    to enable the basal ganglia network to control the body?s movements. By engaging
    the PD patient with novel, highly-cognitive mobility exercises designed by physical
    therapists (PTs), automaticity can be reprogrammed to utilize different regions
    of the brain to control movement. Ultimately, this rewiring will slow (neuroprotection)
    or possibly reverse the degenerative process.  Although the current technology
    development will focus on this one disease (PD), the technology may be applicable
    to other sister diseases (e.g., Alzheimer?s and Dementia) or even other conditions
    (traumatic brain injury, stroke, concussions, and so on). This computer-adaptive
    platform may eventually enable researchers to identify a biomarker that may lead
    to a cure for this idiopathic condition. \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research
    (SBIR) Phase I project will produce a prototype for an automated physical-therapy
    (PT) treatment for patients suffering from Parkinson?s Disease (PD). This automated
    prototype will act as a virtual coach encouraging patients to perform daily mobility
    exercises in the comfort and privacy of their own homes. This unique, automated
    technology will help rewire the brain of the PD patient by engaging both the mind
    and body which will slow the neurodegeneration inherent to PD. The system will
    automatically adjust the treatment protocol in terms of duration and difficulty
    based on the patient?s unique situation including current medication levels. Objective,
    technology-based outcome measures will be summarized for caregivers working with
    the PD patient (primary care provider, physical therapists, neurologists, and
    so on).  In addition, this technology platform will be designed to enable community
    interaction among PD patients as well as facilitate tele-health communications
    between the PD patient and his/her healthcare provider.  The overall objective
    is to develop a PD-specific electronic system that directs PT treatment by developing
    hardware/software to test the feasibility of the adaptive assessment and the automated

    This SBIR Phase 1 project will create an educational technology that accelerates the acquisition of foundational English language skills by children (4 to 10 years old), by melding English and Spanish language instruction, delivered via a personalized digital learning platform. Using state-of-the-art text-to-speech and speech-to-text engines, students that are English Language Learners (ELL) will engage in deliberate literacy practice across the four modalities of language (listening, speaking, reading, writing). Over the last decade, the number of ELL students enrolling in public schools has steadily increased while there remains a shortage of bilingual or certified ELL teachers. Technology can help these teachers to personalize instruction and extend the school day which in turn increases engaged learning time. Achieving college and career readiness is an economic imperative for all students, especially ELL students given the importance of English communication skills to career success. While developing technologies for use in classrooms by young children can be a risky proposition due to the nature of the modern classroom, the reward far outweighs the risk. This project will produce a high-impact technology solution designed for young children that integrates the latest text-to-speech and speech-to-text technologies and is grounded in sound research about language skill acquisition across the four modalities.

    The key innovation of this SBIR Phase 1 project is a plurilinguistic (e.g., Spanish and English) approach to literacy development across the four modalities of language (e.g., reading, writing, speaking, listening) where young students (aged 4-10 years old) are immersed in personalized learning experiences specifically tailored to support and accelerate language development. The first research goal is to test the feasibility for using and adapting proprietary English and Spanish language text-to-speech and speech-to-text engines with young children. The second research goal is to examine the impact of a dual-language personalized learning platform on children?s acquisition of foundational listening, speaking, reading, and writing skills. Participants will be ELL students whose first language is Spanish. The research is based on a plurilinguistic framework for second language acquisition; researchers hypothesize that a dual-language application that leverages students' first language to learn English will score significantly higher on independent measures of foundational literacy skills and self-efficacy for learning compared to students who are using an English-only personalized learning application. A mechanism of growth may be the amount of time students are immersed in deliberate practice of literacy skills. A dual-language personalized learning platform has the potential to extend teacher-led literacy instruction and increase the amount of time students spend engaged in learning English.

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is a 25% cost reduction in solar panel manufacturing
    and the elimination of up to 2.1 Gigatons of annual CO2 generation. As silicon
    wafers are the most expensive component in the $50BN solar panel industry, our
    low-cost wafer manufacturing technology presents the strongest opportunity to
    reduce global solar panel production costs. This cost reduction drives the compelling
    economics needed for increasing solar market penetration. As context, the solar
    market has historically doubled for every 20% cost reduction created by the industry.
    Our single crystal wafers are further significantly higher quality, and therefore
    can enable up to 10% higher effective efficiency using existing commercial solar
    panel manufacturing lines. Further, as the incumbent silicon wafer production
    process is extremely energy- and material-intensive and thus constitutes 80% of
    the solar industry?s carbon footprint, our direct and high efficiency technology
    has the potential to reduce the solar industry's 2026 carbon footprint by over
    50%. \n\nThe proposed project develops the systems needed for our process to produce
    silicon wafers with commercial dimensions and demonstrates to solar manufacturers
    (our customers) that our wafers can be processed by commercial solar cell lines.
    As our process produces a continuous ribbon of silicon, this work will develop
    a cutting system that laser cuts discrete wafers with the edges and dimensions
    needed for commercial solar cell processing. This involves developing the laser
    cutting recipes, the wafer handling systems, and verifying with a third party
    that the edge quality does not interfere with cell processing. Our project then
    investigates and optimizes our wafers' performance during each critical step of
    commercial solar cell processing, including chemical etching and screen printing.
    A successful demonstration that our low-cost wafer can 'drop-in' to an existing
    cell line to deliver equivalent (or better) performance compared to the incumbent
    technology would gate our working with industry partners to commercialize this
    process.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy

    This Phase I SBIR project will investigate cure-in-place materials for filling and stabilizing open wounds to promote healing. Chronic wounds represent a significant and debilitating burden to patients, affecting more than 6.5 million people in the US alone. The incidence of chronic wounds is expected to rise with increasing rates of obesity and diabetes, but current treatment options show limited clinical efficacy. To address this unmet need, new materials that stimulate the body's healing mechanisms must be developed. This project will evaluate a promising new material that can be applied to a wound as a liquid and cured to a solid in contact with the wound. This cure-in-place process is expected to promote healing by ensuring intimate contact between the pro-healing material and the wound bed, mechanically stabilizing the wound area, and stimulating the body's healing responses. There are few cure-in-place materials in clinical use, so this project will also generate new fundamental engineering knowledge about these materials and their potential applications in human health. The advanced wound care market is currently valued at more than $8 billion, and it is growing. Therefore, innovative technologies in this space represent significant business opportunities that create economic growth.

    This project will investigate a novel cure-in-place process for generating a polysaccharide biomaterial that mimics the mechanical and structural properties of native extracellular matrix to stimulate wound healing. The material is generated by curing two aqueous precursor solutions to form a biodegradable, solid, and hydrated polymer matrix. This project will investigate a cure-in-place process by which the precursor solutions will be applied to the wound as liquids and cured in contact with the wound bed. If the extracellular matrix replacement biomaterial can be cured inside of a wound bed, then its pro-healing effects may be amplified due to its ability to fill an irregularly-shaped wound with complete contact with tissue and its capacity to mechanically stabilize the wound bed and stimulate pro-healing biochemistry. The scope of this effort will include developing an optimized formulation for the cure-in-place precursor solution, determining curing conditions for the biomaterial in contact with tissue, evaluating the material properties of the cure-in-place product, and evaluating cure-in-place application and wound healing efficacy in a porcine excisional wound model.

    This SBIR Phase I project will study how teachers use data to improve their instruction. In response to widespread understanding that feedback is a necessary component to improvement, school districts are increasingly investing in teacher coaches to provide feedback critical for teachers. However, this is not scalable, and typically only new or underperforming teachers have access to coaching. Earshot seeks to scale and democratize some aspects of coaching so every teacher can have access to the personalized data and feedback necessary for improvement. The goal is for all teachers to maximize their potential, better engaging students in learning.

    Earshot has developed a cloud-based system using voice analysis to provide data about instruction. The core innovation is a machine learning process to listen to dialogue between teachers and students and analyze the quality of the educational exchange. Funding for this project would enable study of two critical questions: How does providing data about teacher behavior affect what teachers do in their classrooms? And, what kinds of resources, content, and support are necessary to help teachers improve? This research has the potential to transform the way teachers use data about their own performance and receive the necessary help to improve.

The broader impacts of the lab assistant technology will be to promote teaching and learning through professional development of K-12 educators in STEM, and enable broad participation of under-represented groups of people in authentic science inquiry.


    The proposed Lab Assistant will be the first application of state-of-the-art voice recognition technology for educational science experiments. The Lab Assistant will integrate with sensor hardware and mobile apps to enable hands-on experiments in physics, earth science, chemistry, and engineering. The intellectual merits of the Lab Assistant are (1) the development of software that can respond to a wide spectrum of natural language questions and (2) the systems integration of many cutting-edge technologies (wireless sensors, mobile apps, voice recognition software, cloud-based data analysis algorithms) into a simple user interface for science education. The voice interactions will help students overcome disabilities with traditional touch and visual technology, work more independently due to the presence of auditory help, work more effectively in groups, and gain confidence in their STEM abilities. For teachers, the Lab Assistant will provide an "expert in the room" to help guide the hands-on activities that they already do, and provide technical support. The Lab Assistant will be especially useful to teachers without formal science training, that nevertheless need to lead hands-on STEM activities.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the ability to sustainably produce more food with fewer water and energy resources. To feed nine billion people on this planet by 2050 we need to develop new systems of agriculture. Indoor agriculture has the potential to transform the way we grow and source our food, enabling locally-sourced crops at higher yields. Food crops can be grown sustainably year-round near all major urban centers if the energy and water consumption of greenhouses could be reduced. This research will lead to the creation of a suite of water management products and services for indoor farming applications thereby making indoor agriculture environmentally sustainable and economically viable.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will commercialize a novel metal organic framework (MOF) material that enables a new class of compact, energy-efficient cooling and dehumidification systems for greenhouses. Recent discoveries at MIT have revealed a novel MOF material with unprecedented water adsorption capacity. Moreover, the MOF material may be readily synthesized from low-cost, bulk commodity chemicals. A dehumidifier operating with this material can harvest waste heat to provide optimal temperature and humidity conditions for controlled environment agriculture. To translate the MOF material from research lab into large scale production, the material must demonstrate sufficient durability under cycling conditions, be designed to afford low cost processing and be integrated into a cost-efficient climate control system that takes advantage of its unique properties. The goal of the proposed R&D is to accelerate durability testing, design a process chemistry to enable low-cost manufacturing and develop system-level models to
    analyze lifecycle performance and cost sensitivity in an indoor farming application.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to develop single cell analysis technology to provide insight into cellular mechanisms, which has the potential to transform drug development and manufacturing. Single-cell analysis, or the ability to decipher cell-to-cell heterogeneity, is a limiting factor in biotechnology and clinical applications. This project aims to further develop a transformative platform technology for integrated single-cell analysis capable of addressing existing challenges with the current state-of-the-art. The platform will potentially shift the paradigm of drug development and manufacturing, enabling quick iteration and evaluation of new therapeutic compounds. This approach could significantly reduce the time and cost to bring new drugs to market and reduce the overall cost of treating patients, which is a substantial benefit to society. Beyond this initial application, this single-cell analysis platform could become a readily implemented research tool, enhancing our basic understanding of biology, facilitate engineering of cell function, as well as evaluating safety and efficacy of new drugs and treatments.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a robust and cost effective commercial prototype technology platform for integrated single-cell analysis. A key feature of the platform technology is the unprecedented sensitivity in measuring quantitatively secreted molecules from single cells. This is achieved by incubating single cells in extremely small volumes, and enabling analytics on an unprecedented scale in these microscopic bioreactors. The proposed work will lead to the development of a consumable prototype microfluidic chip, enabling quick and resource efficient adaptation of the platform to the marketplace. The proposed prototype will be validated through relevant studies, addressing a confirmed market need in cell line development. Commercial adaptation of this prototype will potentially provide deep insight into biological and physiological processes on a single-cell level, and transform drug development and manufacturing, therapeutic treatment, as well as clinical diagnostics.

    Research (SBIR) project is to develop technology to prevent seafood fraud through
    enabling wholesalers, restaurants, and consumers to rapidly identify mislabeled
    fish product outside of controlled laboratory settings. U.S. consumers are subjected
    to mislabeling errors one out of every three times they consume seafood. Species
    that are cheaper and easier to source are commonly swapped for higher value fish
    such as tuna, snapper, and grouper. This substitution occurs at multiple points
    in the supply chain, from producers/processors to wholesalers to restaurants.
    U.S. consumers pay approximately $32 billion for mislabeled seafood on an annual
    basis. Additionally, this seafood may pose a serious health concern or counteract
    regulatory efforts focused on managing vulnerable fish populations and illegal
    fishing. Current seafood identification efforts are insufficient to eradicate
    mislabeling because they require controlled laboratory settings and highly trained
    personnel.  A few portable tests are becoming available but they lack the ability
    to screen large numbers of samples cost-effectively. The platform proposed here
    will enable more widespread seafood identification testing by delivering identification
    within 45 minutes, on-site, and for a lower per sample cost than existing technologies.
    \n\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes to address seafood mislabeling by developing
    a fast and portable DNA-based screening platform to allow for accurate seafood
    identification to address concerns from consumers, retailers, and regulators regarding
    seafood mislabeling.  The key component of the platform to be developed is a nanopore-based
    sensor technology, which is an amplification-free method for direct counting of
    target nucleic acids. It has been demonstrated in preliminary results that the
    technology is able to distinguish grouper DNA from catfish with single-nucleotide
    specificity. This technology also has achieved multiplexed detection, distinguishing
    36 sequences with one sensor. This project will advance this detection assay towards
    a commercial-ready product by expanding the multiplexing strategy to cover 200+
    sequences, designing probes to distinguish 20+ fish species, and then completing
    a full commercial proof-of-principle by identifying seafood species in blinded
    samples in work done on-site.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
    has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual
    merit and broader impacts review criteria."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to enable autonomous vehicles to make risk-aware decisions at high-speed, by reasoning about the uncertain movements of the people and cars around them to anticipate risks and react defensively. This technology will make new technical approaches to safety and risk viable for the first time. It will enable autonomous cars to drive at regular speeds in dense, highly populated urban environments while reducing the likelihood of accidents - thereby resulting in faster, safer urban autonomous driving. This will increase public trust in autonomous cars and accelerate the development of a new industry which could reshape transportation, freeing people from the need to drive their own cars and increasing their free time and productivity.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a specialized processor for risk-aware motion planning for autonomous vehicles. Motion planning is a critical problem for autonomous cars, which must decide how to move through space to reach a designated goal without colliding with a static obstacle, another vehicle, or a pedestrian. Existing approaches can only construct a few plans per second, and assume that the other road-users will continue on their current trajectories. This is acceptable for highways but not for urban driving, where distances are short and other road-users can change behavior suddenly. This project aims to develop a prototype of a specialized motion planning processor that plans in milliseconds, enabling it to consider all likely future movements of other road-users to anticipate risks and react defensively. This proposal aims to evaluate the feasibility of the processor by designing a prototype, demonstrating that it results in safer driving at normal speeds in urban environments, and quantifying its performance improvements over existing solutions.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to develop a drug discovery platform for preclinical cancer drug testing using a 3D tumor model technology. The technology is designed to reduce time and costs associated with the high failure rate (~95%) of cancer drugs by increasing the likelihood that candidate drugs advancing to animal studies will be effective. The robotic technology will provide a biologically relevant tumor model to test libraries of cancer drugs in the preclinical stage, and replace currently used 2D cancer cell models. This project aims to scale up the 3D tumor model technology to accommodate large drug libraries tested in the pharmaceutical industry, and verify that it meets industry standards and customer needs. The technology will expedite the introduction of effective cancer drugs into the market for patient use, and help reduce the more than half a million of lives that cancer claims annually. The proposed work will significantly facilitate the introduction of the technology into the market as a preclinical cancer drug screening tool by demonstrating its competitive advantages and capabilities to improve cancer drug discovery efforts.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop and validate a 3D tumor model technology for high-throughput cancer drug screening in the pharmaceutical industry. Despite widespread interest in 3D cancer cell cultures, existing methods are not currently used in the industry due to their many disadvantages. The proposed technology provides a robust, high-throughput, and cost-effective approach to generate 3D cancer cell cultures for rapid drug screening, beyond what is currently available. This work will evaluate quantitatively the reliability and robustness of 3D cancer cell cultures and costs of cancer drug testing while considering competitive techniques. A major goal is to adapt the technology to a 1536-microwell plate format for highly efficient drug screening, which is not currently available on the market, and validate the capabilities of the technology to predict cancer drug responses in animal studies. This work will involve robotic protocol optimization, imaging analysis of 3D cultures for consistency, proof-of-concept cancer drug screening, and statistical evaluation of robustness. It is anticipated that the work will demonstrate the advantageous capacity and speed of the technology for drug testing, industry-level robustness, compatibility with different cancer cell types, ability to predict animal study drug responses, and low cost.

    for learning and memory. While music has long been recognized for its mnemonic
    properties (e.g., the ABC song, the 50 states song, etc.) and is widely used as
    a memory aid in the context of early childhood learning, music-based educational
    products for the broader K-12 market are rare. Music is unique in its ability
    to engage learners, make learning enjoyable, and transfer information into memory
    more readily. Yet, music is predominantly experienced as an entertainment medium.
    The goal of this research is to position music as a credible pedagogical tool
    by scientifically crafting songs that support the learning of critical academic
    skills and concepts - offering today's learners a relevant, effective and efficient
    medium for boosting learning outcomes. \n\n\nThe technical innovation proposed
    is a scientific framework for mnemonically optimized music and songs. This research
    features two distinctive innovations: 1) isolation and identification of the mnemonic

    the creation of songs optimized for learning. Methods employed include computational
    and statistical modeling, expert input, and behavioral measurement. The potential
    impact of this research addresses a pressing academic need -- how to teach students
    using pedagogy that is relevant, engaging and scientifically sound. If proven
    feasible, this research will fuel creation of a unique musical form designed specifically
    to enhance memory and learning, with application to K-12 learning and beyond.\n\nThis

    Synthetic polymers and plastics make up a $100 billion industry and impact almost every aspect of daily life: from transportation to consumer products to health care.  These materials are made up of long, individual polymer molecules that are connected in a network that forms the bulk material.  In recent years, chemists have learned how to produce remarkable properties in the individual polymer molecules and control the connections between them.  The Center for the Chemistry of Molecularly Optimized Networks (MONET) is developing the knowledge and methods to translate the remarkable properties now available at the molecular level to new properties of polymer networks.  It fuels innovation in formulation and manufacturing, potentially leading to the development of tough, longer-lived materials that reduce waste while being perfectly tailored to their use.  The broader impacts of the Center include interdisciplinary technical training for young scientists across emerging areas of polymer chemistry, and communication and entrepreneurship experiences that position Center trainees for future careers. Finally, the Center partners with community colleges to increase public awareness of the societal impact of science innovation while simultaneously encouraging broader participation in the sciences by communicating the range of career opportunities available to the diverse community college population.

    The scope of MONET comprises quantitative structure-activity relationships that relate polymer network toughness to the toughness of individual network strands, the molecular architecture of the network, and the mechanism and spatial organization of dynamic strand exchange reactions. These objectives are pursued through a unique combination of methods, including precision polymer synthesis, single molecule spectroscopy, coordination chemistry, photochemical switching, and the development and application of new theoretical models and methods. In addition, a prototype database and digital notation for polymer entry (GIGA - the Global Index of Gel Attributes) is being established. The combined gains in fundamental knowledge, technical capability, and informatics strategy address a major chemical knowledge gap. MONET addresses the role of precisely controlled polymer chain length, the molecular mechanical response of a polymer chain, and the mechanisms by which polymer strands exchange in dynamic networks, as well as the influence of molecular scale network defects on each. The knowledge gained informs strategies to bring remarkable properties to polymer networks, by treating them as complex but understandable chemical systems that can be harnessed to produce currently inaccessible collective properties. Key broader impacts of this award include the development of a polymer network database, technical training and professional development for developing scientists, and science communication to diverse audiences.

    The NSF Center for Nanothread Chemistry pioneers a new form of carbon molecule, formed when arrays of small molecules transform under pressure into arrays of long thread-like molecules in a diamond-like geometry. These remarkable reactions totally reorganize every atom within the starting molecules to produce highly ordered parallel arrays of nanothreads. The team of researchers in the Center for Nanothread Chemistry aims to produce whole new families of nanothreads with diverse chemical compositions, structures, and properties. These materials can currently be made only in very small amounts, and a key goal of the Center is to learn how make larger quantities that will enable further fundamental science and technology impacts. This "flexible diamond" material may be broadly useful in application areas such as high strength composites, energy storage, and catalysis. These new nanomaterials also provide a rich venue for public outreach and the training of a diverse next generation of emerging science professionals.

    The NSF Center for Nanothread Chemistry defines the chemistry generating a new class of organic molecules defined by pervasive covalent bond connectivity in multiple dimensions.  Nanothreads, the first such example, are highly extended one-dimensional molecules with cage-like bonding, akin to the thinnest possible threads of diamond and capped by circumferential hydrogen. Nanothreads are synthesized by an innovative mechanochemical technique in which molecules with multiple unsaturated functions react under stress applied at carefully controlled rates. This strategy overcomes the traditional requirement for topochemical commensuration between the reactant and product and thus allows for many more molecular crystals to react into well-defined structures. The Center team is developing an actionable understanding of the reaction mechanism and enabling the design of new threads with desired arrangements of both interior heteroatoms and exterior functional groups. Post-synthesis modification allows for versatile incorporation of new groups of diverse function and also allows for additional structural elaboration. The unique architecture and properties of nanothreads provide opportunities for commercialization. The interplay of theory, synthesis and characterization provides rich training opportunities for diverse groups of students and researchers.
