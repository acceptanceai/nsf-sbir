    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will be the development of high-performance all-carbon reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) column packing material. Customers of the $1.3 Billion/year HPLC column market include life science, biochemical, industrial, nutritional safety, environmental, agricultural, process engineering, academic and governmental organizations. Reversed-phase columns account for the majority of HPLC column market. Upon market entry, our technology will attract customers whose analysis requirements fall outside the capabilities of current silica- (Hydrophobic alkyl chains typically comprising of 18 carbon atoms (C18) bonded to silica support) or graphitic carbon-based columns as well as those who are seeking faster more efficient analysis at a lower cost. It will also attract customers seeking next-generation performance capabilities for separation of structurally similar compounds, biologics, biobetters or biosimilars. Molecules would include geometric isomers and diastereoisomers (e.g., chiral drugs such as thalidomide), biogenic (e.g., catecholamines or other hormones that are modulated in many neurologic disorders such as Alzheimer Disease). Macromolecules include structurally similar compounds (e.g., hemoglobin variants in sickle cell anemia) and many drug metabolites (e.g., glucuronide in opioid metabolites) and drugs of abuse (e.g., cannabis).

    This SBIR  Phase I project proposes to establish the technical feasibility of a chemically-crosslinked all carbon column material for reverse phase HPLC.  Chromatography technology plays a key role in the development of life-saving pharmaceutical products and medical therapies, ensuring the safety of our food and water, protection of our environment and guarding public health. Reversed-phase HPLC columns employ a hydrophobic stationary phase. Typical silica-based reverse phase HPLC columns are not durable, are challenged by elevated pH and temperature and lack sufficient retention for highly polar and closely related structures. The newer graphitic carbon HPLC columns are prohibitively expensive and neither scalable nor functionalizable for improved selectivity. Our technology's key differentiator is at the molecular surface level, where our novel proprietary fabrication technology directly connect carbon nanomaterials with covalent bonds, producing scalable all-carbon column materials. Our overall objective during Phase I is to identify the optimal column packing conditions and characterize the chromatographic performance of the columns as a function of pH and temperature and ability to separate structurally similar small compounds and biologics. Successful completion of the proposed research and development plan will allow us to finalize highly differentiated all-carbon nanomaterial column prototypes that will offer unparalleled chemical and thermal stability, best-in-class recovery, excellent separation efficiency and increased column longevity at a significantly lower cost.

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase I project focuses on the development and demonstration
    of a new high resolution X-ray detector to be utilized (initially) in medical
    diagnosis. The early work by NGS Detectors and collaborators has shown an improvement
    in resolution by a factor of almost 10 over the X-ray detectors in current use.
    The focus of this Phase I project is to now improve both the resolution and efficiency
    of the detector (in order to reduce the x-ray dose received by patients). The
    initial diagnostic application is for mammography, where the improved resolution
    is expected to allow accurate diagnosis of suspicious features in the breast at
    an early stage, while reducing the false diagnoses (both positive and negative)
    that are recognized to be problematic. The detectors have potential application
    in other medical diagnostics situations, such as neonatal and cardiovascular fields,
    where the higher resolution is expected to extend the application of X-ray diagnostics
    well beyond current practice. Applications for industrial nondestructive evaluation
    in fields such as semiconductor manufacturing are also envisaged. \n\nThis SBIR
    Phase I project focuses on the development and demonstration of a new high resolution
    X-ray scintillation detector. The indirect detector utilizes a new polymeric scintillating
    polymer developed by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories for security applications,
    and incorporates the material into an optical channel plate. The optical channel
    plate contains an ordered array of high quality capillaries (e.g. 10 micron diameter).
    The scintillating polymer absorbs X-rays, and emit photons that are channeled
    to pixels of an optical detector with minimal scattering. A resolution of 10 micron
    has already been demonstrated, an improvement of nearly an order of magnitude
    over both direct and indirect detectors in current use in medical diagnostics.
    The focus of Phase 1 is to complete the detector characterization, with a special
    emphasis on improving the detector efficiency in order to minimize X-ray dose
    rates for patients. The successful completion of Phase I will lead to a Phase
    II that demonstrates that the higher resolution indeed yields higher feature discrimination
    in realistic diagnostic situations.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission
    and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
    intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable a safer, more reliable, and more efficient electric power grid. The power grid is critical infrastructure on which all of America's economic sectors depend, and so its reliability and stability is of the utmost importance. The technology being developed is the ideal modeling and simulation platform to analyze and predict grid abnormalities and blackouts due to its unprecedented ability to simulate complex systems accurately. Its physics-based simulation engine can incorporate more detailed models of loads on the grid, thereby allowing system operators to better assess grid state and stability. The proposed technology is also uniquely capable of modeling distributed energy resources at the transmission and distribution scale, an industry need that has been deemed critical to increase the penetration of renewables on the grid. The technology has substantial potential for commercial impact, as there are thousands of transmission, distribution, generation, and consulting organizations that are potential customers. Combined, these factors can help enable a more robust, secure grid that operates with reduced cost and emissions. This Phase I project represents the first step in making this technology a commercial reality.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project represents a significant departure from traditional methods that are used to model the electric power grid. The team's foundational research has already shown that the technology can simulate the U.S. Eastern Interconnection (half of the U.S. transmission grid) from any initial condition to evaluate complex contingencies - capabilities that are not possible with existing tools. The current- and voltage-based formulation used in the model is more flexible than is used in traditional power systems simulation software, enabling more realistic physics- and/or measurement-based models for more accurate simulation results. The Phase I project includes developing a secure and robust cloud platform for the technology that supports parallelized grid analyses, with a full library of component models and an intuitive web-based interface. This will enable system operators, utilities, and consultants to improve their planning studies and operations by enabling more accurate simulations at a higher throughput than is possible with today's software. The work done in Phase I will serve as a foundation for future advancements in power grid modeling and simulation, including integrated transmission and distribution system analysis and statistical analysis to assess the impact of uncertainties on the grid.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project seeks to reduce the cost and complexity of incorporating energy-saving phase change materials (PCMs) into end-use products by developing a new class of form-stable PCM-modified resins that contain a unique reactive-polyolefin component. Importantly, the development of new PCMs for the passive thermal regulation of electric vehicle (EV) batteries has the potential to increase EV safety, range, and affordability, representing an addressable market currently valued at $87m and that is growing at 20% per year. Validation of these advantages should significantly benefit society by increasing electric vehicle performance and reducing the frequency of expensive battery replacement, thus increasing the adoption of energy efficient vehicles and reducing green-house gas emissions. This project can also result in an increase in the penetration of energy efficient PCM technology in additional markets worth a combined $370m, including building materials, textiles, electronics, and packaging, which can have a large positive economic impact on society. Finally, successful realization of the goals of this SBIR Phase I program will further enable scientific / technological understanding of PCMs that are based on organic materials.

    The intellectual merit of this project is the validation of a new paradigm for a bottoms-up approach to the design, production, and optimization of structurally-well-characterized reactive polyolefins of tunable molecular weight and narrow polydispersity that possess superior performance and stability characteristics as organic phase change materials (PCMs) for waste heat management as compared to conventional paraffin-based PCMs that have remained virtually unchanged for the past half century. To achieve this goal, reactive polyolefins that are the best candidates for commercialization will be identified through optimization of molecular structure, stereochemical tacticity, and the temperature and kinetics of main-chain and side-chain phase transitions. Reaction variables will also be optimized to provide the highest yields of reactive polyolefins under industrially-relevant and scalable process conditions. The development of PCM-modified thermoset resins based on reactive polyolefins will provide access to commercial waste heat management applications that employ physical constructs obtained from casting or injection molding and should benefit from lower production costs, a wider range of applications, and greater long-term stability.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to develop a delaminated zeolite-based catalyst to facilitate more economical and environmentally friendly propylene-oxide (PO) production.  PO is a commodity chemical with a $5.6B/year market.  The two current pain points for PO producers are (i) that the currently used industrial catalyst lacks long-term stability under the harsh conditions at the tail-end of the PO synthesis reactor, and (ii) as a result of catalyst deficiency, that the process to manufacture PO consumes an extra $140M of raw materials per year, separate from the problem in (i) above.  Berkeley Materials Solutions developed a catalyst for the tail-end of the PO synthesis reactor that nearly eliminates both of these problems. The catalyst allows for nearly 100% conversion of all raw material into PO, which leads to $145 M/year of additional revenue for PO producers, corresponding to a revenue increase of 8.6%. This increased revenue comes at no additional cost since it is a drop-in replacement.  In addition, there are significant energy efficiency improvements associated with recovering the currently lost raw material in the PO synthesis process, which amounts to a CO2 footprint of ~740 kilo tons of CO2 per year worldwide.

    The intellectual merit of this project will be represented by the development of a generalizable crystalline catalyst platform to replace existing amorphous catalysts. Technical hurdles that will be addressed in the proposal are (i) the successful delamination of a layered zeolite precursor using a swelling method and sonication, (ii) establishing a sonication-free scalable delamination method for layered zeolite precursors, and (iii) the insertion of catalytically active heteroatom sites into the delaminates frameworks. If successful, this will enable the economical production of these zeolite catalysts for application in the PO synthesis reactor under flow conditions. The targeted scales even during Phase I activities are large enough to enable testing in collaboration with industrial partners who manufacture propylene oxide at large scales. These test results will be used to optimize the prototype catalyst.  The results from Phase I activities will help to uncover other possible opportunities to use delaminated zeolites as highly efficient catalysts for chemical manufacturing.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the rapid, cost-effective detection of natural gas leakage to improve public safety, mitigate global climate change, and decrease product loss.  Natural gas is the largest provider of power in the United States.  However, more than 80 Tg of leakage occurs at well pads and pipelines during production alone.  Such leakage poses a public health risk, with 1300 significant incidents reported from 1997 ? 2016, resulting in 50 fatalities, 180 injuries, and $2B in costs. Additionally, methane is a greenhouse gas with a warming potential that is 84 times higher than CO2.  In 2015, natural gas leakage accounted for 198 million tons of CO2 equivalents, corresponding to a carbon tax value of more than $2B.  Finally, energy companies want to reduce leakage to avoid product loss, with 80 Tg of methane having a value of $12B.  This project will directly impact the aforementioned areas by improving the efficiencies and costs associated with natural gas leak detection.  With over 2.2 million miles of local utility gas distribution pipelines 1.2 million well pads in the U.S. alone, the commercial prospects for an improved natural gas leak detection system are very promising with expected revenues exceeding $70M.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will involve the development of a comprehensive natural gas leakage detection solution that integrates compact, low-cost sensors with state-of-the-art analytics.  The solution, which can be used in drone-based and handheld monitoring, will enable energy providers to detect natural gas leakage from well pads and pipelines.  In Phase I, technical feasibility will be demonstrated by the development of a lightweight gas sensor based on incoherent, cavity-enhanced spectrometry and a natural gas camera based on filtered infrared imaging. These sensors will be integrated with global positioning system, wind speed/direction, and data analytics platform.  The Phase I solution will be laboratory tested to characterize its analytical performance, before undergoing field testing on controlled natural gas leaks.  In Phase II, the sensor hardware, electronics, and firmware will be refined to meet the stringent size, weight, power, and environmental constraints of drone-based and handheld deployment.  Likewise, the analytics platform will be refined to incorporate the STTR sensors, interpret the infrared camera data, and provide comprehensive leak detection reports.  The Phase II prototypes will be field tested under real-world conditions with a variety of potential customers for both well pad monitoring and pipeline distribution system monitoring.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be the availability of a patient readiness formula, an algorithm that will improve outcomes by engaging patients in their own healthcare from hospital admission through discharge. The societal impact includes (1) reducing the cost related to readmissions for Congestive Heart Failure, Acute Myocardial Infarction, and pneumonia, a total of $5.8 billion annually paid by U.S. taxpayers, (2) decreasing the cost of each hospital stay by $5-10K per Medicare beneficiary by using proven treatment and discharge planning models, (3) reducing the burden on post-acute providers (primary care physician, long-term care, home health, ambulatory care) by achieving optimized clinical stability prior to discharge, and (4) providing a method for a patient population (studies show who are eager to participate) to actively engage in their own treatment decisions.

    The proposed project will create a proprietary algorithm that produces a patient-specific hospital readmission-risk score. The score is based on the algorithm's dynamic adjustment of all known readmission risk factors determined by the patient's unique profile that includes clinical and other factors. The goal of the project is to accurately predict a patient's readmission-risk using the dynamic algorithm. The results of the algorithm will be verified via the facility's claims system. Technical challenges to be addressed by Phase I include the compilation of known risk factors, development of the algorithm, and creating multi-tract data input methods to obtain live data. The research and development plan will focus on identifying risks, development of the algorithm, and determining methods for capturing live data needed to execute the algorithm.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will be functional neuronal cells derived from human adult adipocytes that will have applications in regenerative medicine.  The goal is to develop dopaminergic (DA) neural progenitor cells (NPCs) from transdifferentiated human adult adipocytes using a DA cell induction cocktail.  This will have application in cellular therapeutics and research tools for Parkinson's Disease (PD), and other neuronal diseases. In addition, these studies will impact the field of stem cell research and regenerative medicine, since this will be the first demonstration that functional neuronal cells, the main building blocks of brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nervous systems, can be produced from mature fat cells that can be used as cellular therapeutics for several neurological disorders.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop new technology for generation of midbrain dopaminergic (DA) neural progenitor cells (NPCs) from adult adipocytes (fat cells), which will used as a platform to develop cellular therapeutics for Parkinson's Disease (PD), and PD research tools. Recently, using a chemical genetics approach (chemical approach or small molecule approach), engraftable midbrain DA neuronal progenitor cells (DA NPCs) from human bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-hMSCs) have been generated. Additionally, DA neuronal progenitor-like cells also had been produced from de-differentiated fat cells (DFAT cells) that have several advantages over BM-hMSCs such as homogeneity of DFAT cell cultures, ease of isolation and low immunogenicity. The goal of Phase I project is to validate and optimize the DA induction protocol for generation of midbrain DA NPC from DAFT cells. Phase II will focus on clinical grade manufacturing of these DA cells and testing their therapeutic effect in several preclinical animal models of PD. Commercial products emerging from Phase I/II work include cellular therapeutics for PD and research tools for PD.

    The?broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is represented by the development of a company in a unique field of single crystal growth addressing needs in solid-state lasers. Single crystal growth represents a small and highly specialized, but absolutely essential, area of modern materials technology. Solid-state lasers are commercially vital because they are compact, durable, relatively inexpensive, and field deployable in many technologies. Single crystals are essential components to solid-state lasers and thereby represent significant commercial potential.  This project will enhance the skill set of specialty manufacturers of high quality single crystals for solid-state lasers. It represents an unmet commercial need in short wavelength solid-state lasers and also will expand the technological skill set of single crystal growers. This last point is especially important, as there is a serious lack of skills, technology and infrastructure in solid state laser production in this country, and this makes the US increasingly dependent on offshore suppliers of essential materials. This program will help train the next generation of critical materials manufacturing experts in the US.

    The proposed project intends to address the development of new single crystals called Strontium Beryllium Borate (SBBO). These crystals are an enabling technology for the manufacture of short wavelength solid-state lasers lasing at and below 266 nm. Such lasers have many potential applications but at present there are no materials capable of practical performance at these very short wavelengths. This shortcoming represents a significant commercial opportunity. The project will examine production of single crystals of a new material to meet this need using hydrothermal synthesis, which employs very hot water at high pressures as a growth environment. In this Phase I project, research will be undertaken to develop a growth protocol of large single crystals of this vital material, A feedstock will be perfected, and seed crystals will be produced. Transport conditions will be optimized, and suitable temperature gradients will be identified. Preliminary evaluation of crystal quality will be performed. Suitable crystals will be sent to collaborators in the laser manufacturing industry for preliminary production of solid-state short wavelength lasers. The seed crystals and growth protocols from the research in this Phase I program will be used in a Phase II project for development of a full-scale commercial manufacturing process for this crystal.

    This SBIR Phase I project will develop key components of a next-generation lithium metal battery that greatly increases both energy density and safety compared to the best lithium-ion batteries. Such a technology has the potential to deliver significant societal value by improving the state-of-the-art in battery markets such as implantable medical devices, electrified flight, electric vehicles, and many others. In fact, improvements just in medical device batteries may cause a step-change improvement in device design and delivery of healthcare that could save tens of thousands of lives annually. This project will increase opportunities for US-based manufacturing and create jobs by leveraging existing domestic prototyping and manufacturing capabilities around the country. Once material and process costs come down with scale, this technology can also help to expedite mass-market adoption of electric vehicles, consumer electronics, wearables, and other portable devices. The proposed technology may eventually allow for the widespread adoption of sustainable electrified transportation, reduce US dependence on foreign oil, significantly reduce carbon emissions related to transportation, and build an edge for US-based battery R&D and manufacturing.


    The project addresses the key unmet challenge for next-generation battery chemistries based on lithium metal: highly reversible cycling (> 500 cycles with lithium plating efficiency > 99.7%) with high charging current density (> 1 mA/cm^2). The objective of the proposed R&D is to prove out a concept around novel metallic anode formulation that can enable unprecedented cycle life, lithium plating efficiency, and charging rate. Existing cell prototypes with pure lithium metal anodes have already demonstrated stable cycling and high specific energy at lower rates. However, inadequate lithium plating efficiency at high charging rates limits the cycle life that can be achieved in a commercial cell. Phase I research efforts will focus on two main objectives: (i) improve reversibility and efficiency of the metallic anode at high charge rates compared to pure lithium metal, and (ii) demonstrate the performance benefits in a coin cell with commercially attractive design parameters that delivers 500 cycles with minimal lithium loss at a high rate. The ultimate goal of the Phase I research is to develop a high-performance lab prototype, based on an optimized electrolyte and commercial cell components, that will provide proof of feasibility for rapid commercialization in the target market.

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase I project introduces a new paradigm for early monitoring
    and detection of breast cancer: the Quantified Self Exam. In the United States
    over 300,000 women are diagnosed and 40,000 women die from breast cancer every
    year. Breast cancer has a 99% survival rate if detected early, but limitations
    in cost, sensitivity, accessibility, and convenience of existing screening technologies
    result in one third of breasts cancers getting missed at early stages. Since treatment
    for early stage cancer is an order of magnitude less costly than treatment for
    stage 3 and 4 cancers, there is a clear economic and societal benefit for the
    development of better breast cancer monitoring and screening tools. To address
    this challenge, the technology proposed in this project leverages the proven benefits
    of ultrasound imaging and the newfound power of cloud-based artificial intelligence
    to provide a regular and accessible self-monitoring tool that can quantify and
    track suspicious changes in breast tissue. The device portability, low cost, 2
    minute scan time, and automated analysis of breast image data will greatly increase
    the accessibility of breast cancer monitoring for women, which in turn stands
    to decrease the cost burden of this disease for the US healthcare system. \n\nThis
    SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a new tool for early detection and monitoring
    of breast cancer: the Quantified Self Exam (QSE) that combines a low-cost, compact
    3D ultrasound device and positioning accessory with artificial intelligence to
    empower women and their physicians with appropriate and actionable data.  The
    QSE technology proposed in this project operates independent of user skill and
    captures 3D volumetric images of the whole breast in 2 minutes.  The system architecture

    focus on four objectives: (i) optimize electrical hardware and low-level imaging
    software for spatial resolution and image quality; (ii) build a QSE scanner that
    maximizes field of view and volumetric integrity; (iii) build a positioning accessory
    for positioning of the QSE scanner; (iv) demonstrate the longitudinal repeatability
    of QSE imaging by validating the alignment of 3D ultrasound volumes on a breast
    phantom."

    This SBIR Phase I project aims to design, build, test, and refine a cartridge of medicine for use with an inkjet printer for printing medicine that was developed with past NSF ERC support for academic research and I-Corps support for market research. Similar to how a conventional inkjet printer deposits small quantities of liquid ink on blank paper, the printer deposits precisely measured quantities of medicine on blank carriers to make the final pharmaceutical product. Due to its smaller size and relatively quick production times, the printer enables and is currently aimed at personalized medicine applications, wherein dosages and other product factors are customized to individual named patients by their medical practitioner and drug products are made for the patient to suit based on such a patient-specific prescription. The detailed development of medicine cartridges has not been attempted before, and is specifically pursued in this SBIR Phase I project to demonstrate cleanliness, address potential counterfeiting concerns, provide ease of use, and provide tracking if required. Such cartridges are envisioned to enhance the impact of printed medicine for personalized medicine applications, thereby improving the level of healthcare for this nation?s ill and creating a high-value just-in-time pharmaceutical production market.

    It is technologically very challenging to adapt the cartridge concept to pharmaceutical applications. These challenges include: the need for the cartridge to maintain cleanliness and integrity during storage and in use; the need to ensure that final products match required composition and dissolution profiles; the need to ensure that the contents of a cartridge are shelf-stable over its life; the prevention of any accidental introduction of impurities or deliberate counterfeiting; and the need to preclude operator error in wrong-substance or wrong-dose dispensing. Further challenges include the need to select and optimize cartridge size and form factors. Preliminary designs for cartridges have been identified, and this SBIR Phase I support will enable such designs to be built, tested and improved. Such cartridges will be filled with both inert materials and with certain specific drug substances identified as being of commercial interest. The cartridge and printer are planned to recognize each other to prevent operator transcription error. Testing for composition and impurities is planned with standard analytical chemistry techniques used in the pharmaceutical sector, such as high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) or mass spectrometry. The end result is a robust and reliable cartridge, to transform personalized medicine for the better for everyone.

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase I project entails the development of an EEG analysis
    software application that identifies the epileptogenic zone (EZ - where seizures
    start in brain) in medically refractory epilepsy (MRE) patients. Over 1 million
    people in the US have MRE, meaning that they do not respond to medication. MRE
    patients are frequently hospitalized, burdened by epilepsy-related disabilities,
    and contribute to 80% of the $16 billion dollars spent annually in the US treating
    epilepsy patients. There are 2 treatments: (i) surgical removal of the EZ, and
    (ii) neurostimulation, where the EZ is electrically stimulated to suppress seizures.
    Successful outcomes depend critically on accurately identifying the EZ from invasive
    EEG recordings, which is a long costly process, leading to grim outcomes where
    30%-70% of treated patients continue to have seizures. There has thus been an
    intensive search for an accurate data analytics tool to reduce time, risks and
    costs of invasive monitoring. This project involves further development of such
    a tool that generates visual \"heat\" maps from EEG data. The tool, grounded in
    dynamical systems theory and neuroengineering, has been validated with data from
    20 patients, achieving 95% accuracy in predicting surgical outcomes. Reducing
    monitoring time reduces the risk of infection from the brain being exposed, and
    reduces hospital costs associated with lengthy stays and clinical staff reviewing
    data. By providing more accurate definition of the EZ, the tool will also enable
    use of a precise and entirely new laser ablation procedure that makes tiny lesions
    in targeted structures as opposed to removing large portions of the brain. If
    successful, the tool will be closer to commercialization under a sustainable business
    model. Major EEG vendors and medical device companies are looking for accurate
    software applications in epilepsy treatment to enhance their product suites, and
    will be very interested in licensing the tool. \n\nThis Small Business Innovation
    Research Phase I project involves development of a cutting-edge EEG tool that
    uses dynamic network modeling and a highly innovative and patented theory of \"fragility\"
    of nodes in a dynamic network to localize the EZ from invasive EEG recordings,
    taking into account the extensive interconnection of neurons in the brain. The
    more \"fragile\" an EEG channel, the more likely it is in the EZ. Project aims
    are to (i) validate the tool on a large patient cohort, using invasive EEG data
    before, during and after seizure events; (i) test the tool?s efficacy using noninvasive
    scalp EEG recordings and (iii) design the user-interface and integrate this application
    into the existing clinical workflow to facilitate prospective studies. These milestones
    will minimize key risks in bringing this innovation to market, which are adoption,
    perceived liability, regulatory approval and reimbursement. Adoption risk will
    be mitigated if the tool is accurate, quick and easy-to-use, requiring essentially
    the push of a button to receive fragility maps. Accuracy risk will be mitigated
    if our completed retrospective study, including refinement of network models,
    shows comparable performance to our preliminary data. The quick and easy-to-use
    risks will be mitigated with the development of an intuitive interface that importantly
    integrates with the existing EEG data acquisition and visualization tools. Regulatory
    risk is low as a predicate device exists. Perceived liability of the tool in mis-diagnosis
    is a low risk as the tool is not intended to replace the clinician's analysis,
    but rather it provides an enhanced visualization of the EEG data (as demonstrated
    in our retrospective study) already being collected and analyzed in the clinical
    workflow. Finally, reimbursement risks will be mitigated if accurate identification
    of the EZ using the tool has the potential to significantly reduce or even eliminate
    the focal MRE segment reducing epilepsy-related costs by $6 billion/year. Consequently,
    healthcare and insurance providers will have a strong incentive to pay for, or
    reimburse epilepsy clinics for the tool.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory
    mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
    intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to optimize water utilization, thereby improving agricultural production. It is projected that the human population will exceed 9 billion by 2050.  To meet the expected demand, global food production must increase by more than 50% by 2050. This SBIR project will have impact not only in expanding fundamental knowledge of plant utilization of water but also in contributing to agricultural productivity, an urgent and practical need for human survival, in a sustainable manner.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to commercialize the advanced water-treatment technology that could enhance plant growth, and therefore improve crop output in agricultural applications. In short, a thin layer (about 100 microns, as thin as a human hair) of interfacial water was found to exist with a slightly higher pH, net negative charge, and a tendency to exclude impurities. These findings were similar to those found by other independent research groups working with xylem cells in plants and muscle cells in animals. Several hydrogels and polymers were also found to contain interfacial water with similar properties. Initial studies regarding the practical use of the interfacial water were conducted in a plant system. On average, initial results show a rapid growth rate of around 10% to 20% improvement compared to the control group; preliminary findings that have now been confirmed to be similar amongst four different plants, namely chick pea, wheatgrass, basil, and pea shoots. This SBIR will enable continued testing and scale up the interfacial water generator to meet water demands for customer validations.

- abstractText: "This STTR Phase I project will support the development of a powerful
    new track-and-trace platform in the global fight against counterfeit products
    in high-risk supply chains. From pharmaceuticals to aviation to defense, many
    industries now face a growing problem with maintaining visibility to the authentic
    products in their supply chain, while identifying black market and grey market
    products that could harm their customers and have serious impacts on national
    security. This project will build on interdisciplinary research from materials
    science, photonics and information technology to create an innovative new platform
    that connects physical supply chains with digital supply chains through the use
    of covert codes that are placed onto products. These codes are printed using  nanoparticles
    that are only visible when exposed to a laser with very specific properties. The
    security platform that this research enables will provide U.S. industry with a
    robust new system for authenticating genuine products and maintaining visibility
    throughout the global supply chain. \n \n\nThis Small Business Technology Transfer
    Phase I project develops a system designed to thwart counterfeiting.  The system
    is based on 1) covert printed markings, carrying encoded information, that convert
    near infrared (NIR) excitation either to visible light or to shorter-wavelength
    NIR light, and 2) a proprietary reader-decoder system that is cyber-enabled to
    access secure data bases. The two major technical challenges addressed in this
    project both involve maximizing the overall signal-to-noise ratio of the system.
    \ The first challenge improves the long-term stability and up-converting nanoparticle
    payload-capacity of a novel, micro-emulsion (aqueous continuous-phase) ink. The
    second challenge creates micro- or nano-scale substrates that greatly amplify
    the up-conversion signal. Successfully overcoming these technical hurdles will
    significantly advance the readiness of the technology for commercialization and
    Phase II development. It is estimated that reaching the milestones specified within
    the specific research objectives will lead to a 250x enhancement of up-conversion
    intensity when using low excitation power densities. Such an enhancement would
    be transformational to the system and enable the use of lower laser powers in
    the reader/decoder device which in turn, would lower costs and greatly extend
    the utility of the system to, for example, a hand held, portable reader."

    Research (SBIR) project is the introduction of an environmentally-beneficial filtration
    material and corresponding high performance, and long-lasting point-of-use water
    filter. The competitive advantages of the product are increased treatment efficiency,
    longer service life, and sustainable production at a  similar price point to commercial
    products. The biofabricated advanced media filter results in sophisticated material
    properties and higher consumer value at a lower overall cost. The success of this
    Phase I project has potential for far reaching commercial impacts beyond consumer
    water filtration. By demonstrating the consistency of the metal impregnated filter
    material, commercial applications could be extended to the fields of emissions
    control, energy storage, and chemical production. In each of these fields, including
    water filtration, the new filter material would be replacing unsustainable materials
    derived from coal and coconut. These existing materials have significant environmental
    impacts associated with their production and transportation. \n\nThis SBIR Phase
    I project proposed to use the efficiencies of biological organisms to produce
    high performance, economical, and sustainable materials for premium filtration
    applications. To achieve this goal, a biofabrication process has been developed
    that involves the controlled cultivation of fungi serving as a template for the
    production of advanced activated carbon. This bioprocess allows for precision
    control over the chemical and physical properties which can be easily customized
    for targeted applications. Using the process of bioaccumulation and biosorption,

    metals/metal oxide nanoparticles. These in-situ functionalities greatly improve
    material performance, extension of water filtration service life (2X over state-of-the-art),
    whilst reducing overall energy consumption during manufacturing. While this process
    has been demonstrated on the gram production basis, the technical hurdles in this
    Phase I include scaling production to the kilogram level, providing critical material
    validation testing, and prototyping of a final consumer product. To execute these
    goals, growth conditions will be optimized in scaled bioreactors, industrial testing
    methodology will be employed, and a simple, yet high value water filtration device
    will be produced.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been

    Research (SBIR) project will contribute to development of a novel Balance-Enhancing
    Footwear Insert for preventing falls in the high risk elderly population. Falls
    are the leading cause of fatal injuries and the most common reason for trauma-related
    hospital admissions among older adults. One in every four Americans over age of
    65 falls each year, and the financial burden from the falls in the elderly is
    expected to reach $67B by 2020. Therefore, introduction of a smart insole might
    significantly reduce the financial burden for the Medical Care System. It will
    also allow the elderly population to achieve maximum independence in the activities
    of daily living. The proposed insole will also address the critical needs of the
    athletic shoe industry to reduce the incidents of ankle sprains. The development
    of the new smart balance?enhancing insole, which improves balance without irritation
    and habituation effects will likely lead to new fabrication techniques for manufacturing
    insoles. This SBIR innovation has the potential to introduce to the market a safe,
    reliable and cost-effective insole that could be easily manufactured and distributed.\n\n
    \ \nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a novel insole to facilitate
    proper and timely response to a person?s movements in order to maintain good balance
    while walking or standing. The plantar sole is a ?dynamometric map? of human balance
    control. The loss of balance occurs when the body weight is shifted too close
    to the plantar sole boundary. The timely information to the Central Nervous System
    (CNS) about such movements is critical for balance control. The proposed insert,
    with a system of microcells containing viscous fluid, triggers instantaneous rise
    of protrusions around the insole perimeter area in response to the sudden increase
    of pressure that excites the mechanoreceptors reporting to the CNS.  Such a balance-enhancing
    solution provides well-timed regional amplification of cutaneous mechanoreceptor
    sensitivity but without the side effects of the existing textured insoles. The
    shortcomings include permanent discomfort and irritation in the plantar sole,
    which results in desensitization of the sole somatosensory system. The main research
    objectives include: Engineering design of the insert; research of materials to
    meet the performance goals; identification of the manufacturers for future mass
    production; creating testing frameworks to insure performance according to the

    This SBIR Phase I project intends to improve the outcomes of children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) by providing critical data from non-clinical settings that are currently unavailable to autism treatment providers. The project also focuses on accelerating the analysis of that data. It is estimated that the costs associated with ASD will be more than $2 million over a patient's life. However, studies have shown that the costs of lifetime care for a child diagnosed with ASD can be reduced by 2/3 with early intervention. Designing an appropriate treatment program, and then monitoring its efficacy, requires the collection of a range of data to avoid dependence on inference and anecdotes. Treatment providers often collect detailed data while working with an individual diagnosed with ASD, but they count on parents and caregivers to provide them with data regarding the child's progress outside the clinical setting. The data submitted are usually incomplete and inadequate (if submitted at all). This SBIR Phase I project will result in a prototype that will rapidly provide autism treatment providers with critical data and analysis, reducing the amount of time it takes to design an optimal treatment program, and thereby reducing the long-term costs associated with a diagnosis of ASD.


    This Phase I project will result in a prototype that will make the process of logging data almost frictionless for parents. That narrative data will be combined with video data, biometric data, and additional data collected passively from external sources. All the data will be merged, and then analyzed via machine learning to locate patterns and provide a complete picture to the child's behavior analyst. Developing a camera that will be unobtrusive enough for a child with ASD to tolerate will present a challenge, as will developing the associated software to tag items within the camera's view and save only relevant clips (such as the times immediately before, during and after a meltdown). It will also be challenging to develop a wearable device that a child with ASD will tolerate, along with the associated sensors and software to track metrics associated with arousal and stress. The most significant technical challenge, however, will be to develop the software that combines the multiple data streams and outputs a standardized ABC report (Antecedent, Behavior, Consequence) that would be judged as high quality by a Board Certified Behavior Analyst.

    This SBIR Phase I project addresses the pressing need for providing incarcerated youth and adults with continual systematic and secure personal education and training opportunities, giving inmates the skills they need to productively re-enter society. It will also reduce recidivism rates, and increase their confidence and the potential for contributing to local communities. Every year, more than 700,000 state and federal prisoners are released back into their communities, often with no greater skills than when they went in. The majority of prisoners lack basic high school degrees. The goal of the project is to provide the most effective, secure and flexible offline e-Learning applications for acquiring high school equivalency, the area of greatest need, within the constraints of the prison environment; covering both instructor-led and self-directed learning sessions. At the completion of Phase I, correctional facilities will have an opportunity to utilize a secure, easy-to-administer, offline e-Learning solution for the General Education Development (GED) or for any other education and training in a digital format. A wealth of high-quality instructional programs will be incorporated into the platform that will ultimately lead to a high school equivalency diploma, and additional support to address technical and vocational skills.

    The Phase I project innovation is centered around the delivery of a single, highly-flexible, secure learning management platform, where multiple applications can be stored on a single server. It will provide the General Education Development (GED) content and will be expandable to incorporate additional e-Learning applications including those that can address recidivism. The adaptable learning management platform will automate the provisioning and installation of these GED and non-GED educational applications on private servers, either on-site at the correctional facility or on off-site private server networks. Different sets of content would be automatically customized for each prison, with no outside Internet connectivity required. Another key innovation will be the ability to have the e-Learning system follow the inmate as they are moved. They will always have access to their specific content and progress status as their data will be centrally-hosted on the fully secured prison servers. Their individual records can be confirmed and reviewed for parole evaluations. By providing uniform student analytics and continuous monitoring of learning outcomes with different content and educational application vendors, the system will advance the capability of offline learning to be a data-driven endeavor and will deliver a personalized experience comparable to systems in civilian life.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will evaluate the technical feasibility and commercial viability of a novel sample preparation method for cryo-EM (cryogenic electron microscopy) studies.  As a rapidly growing technique in the structural biology field, the cryo-EM market as a whole is estimated to be more than $5 billion a year, with > $500 million attributed to the sample preparation space.  In spite of an overall revenue growth rate of more than 70% per year, cryo-EM sample preparation remains an area that has yet to see any major technological breakthroughs commercialized in the past decade.  In fact, the current industry solution is reported to have a failure rate of > 95%.  By providing a sample preparation system that actually works, this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will significantly reshape the massive and rapidly expanding cryo-EM market and allow scientists to more readily collect detailed protein structures in their native state.  This new knowledge on the molecular basis of cells and of life itself will be used to facilitate as well as accelerate the development of new pharmaceuticals as well as therapeutic treatments for diseases and thus greatly benefit human health in the long run.

    The intellectual merit of this project is the development of a cryo-EM sample preparation device built on the application of state-of-the-art microfluidic jet systems to deposit and vitrify protein solution on EM grids in milliseconds, which is at least 1000x faster than the current methods.  Furthermore, it offers scientists the novel ability to control the thickness of the vitrified aqueous layer and, overall, more control over the sample vitrification process.  With this new sample preparation device, a larger region of the cryo-EM grids will have intact protein molecules with the right layer thickness for structural determination, allowing researchers to save time and money in terms of both grid preparation and screening in a high-throughput manner.  Currently, the proposed technology has not been tested nor used anywhere.  Therefore, the first and foremost goal of this SBIR Phase I project is to better understand and well characterize the technical capabilities and limitations of this proposed innovation, with additional R&D work needed before product commercialization, which is expected in five years.  The project will focus on defining and optimizing both the geometric and experimental setup in order to de-risk the technology.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a novel cancer targeting technology, Active Tissue Targeting via Anchored ClicK Chemistry (ATTACK), for targeted treatment of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). TNBC is a subtype of breast cancer that occurs in 10-20% of diagnosed breast cancers and is more likely to affect younger people, African Americans, Hispanics, and those with BRCA1 gene mutation. Currently, TNBC patients are mainly treated with chemotherapeutics and cannot benefit from existing targeting therapeutics due to the lack of Estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) or hormone epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her2/neu). This project will develop the first cell labeling based targeting technology (ATTACK) for TNBC treatment. A novel unnatural sugar will be developed for cancer-specific labeling of TNBC through metabolization to insert an artificial receptor onto TNBC and then target the artificial receptor to deliver therapeutic taxanes through a specific reaction between the receptor and the taxanes-drugs. The project involves interdisciplinary combination of knowledge from chemistry, biology, materials engineering, and pharmaceutical science. The successful development of the project will afford an effective targeted therapeutic drug for TNBC patients with improved quality of life in the future.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a novel cancer targeting technology, Active Tissue Targeting via Anchored ClicK Chemistry (ATTACK), for targeted treatment of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). ATTACK can treat untargetable cancers that do not have established cell surface receptors through cancer-specific artificial receptor insertion of de novo designed unnatural sugars and subsequent azide-Click reaction mediated targeted delivery of therapeutic drugs. Currently, TNBC patients are mainly treated with chemotherapeutics and cannot benefit from existing targeting therapeutics due to the lack of Estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) or hormone epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her2/neu). This project will develop the first cell labeling based targeting technology (ATTACK) for TNBC treatment. Unnatural sialic acid (a type of sugar) precursors with azide will be first used for tumor-specific labeling on cell surface and subsequent targeting. Multiple taxane candidates will be synthesized and preliminary in vitro DMPK properties of the conjugates will be studied including solubility, plasma stability, liver microsome metabolization, and cytotoxic MTT assay. In vivo biodistribution and efficacy of the taxane candidates in combination with unnatural sugar labeling will also be studied in mice tumor models to validate the anti-TNBC efficacy of the drug candidates. The accomplishment of the Phase I research will enable further translational development of the novel cancer-targeting therapeutics into clinical applications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will consist in defining the way toward an ultra-fast and energy efficient accelerator for Machine Learning applications deployed on cloud computing. The merging of cloud computing and Machine Learning is shaping our everyday life experience. Examples of applications running on the cloud and exploiting Machine Learning algorithms include data mining, natural language processing and pattern recognition. These three together represent cognitive computing and, due to a vast and growing number of APIs for developers, it is becoming easier to access the computational power of the cloud and develop new applications. This new computation potential is used by businesses to connect data and find patterns valuable for commerce or to improve cybersecurity.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will define a new kind of hardware accelerator, able to speed up cognitive computation by orders of magnitude while reducing energy consumption compared with state-of-the-art processors. The proposed technology is fast and energy efficient, but can be prone to low precision and temperature variation sensitivity. During Phase I, the company will define the hardware accelerator at the system level, optimizing the design for ultra-high speed and sufficient precision to carry out the cognitive computation required. At the same time, the effect of temperature variation and noise will be minimized through improved design. Finally, the energy consumption of the new designs will be estimated and compared with the overall performance of state-of-the-art competitive architectures.

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable the high sample testing throughput
    necessary for quantum magnetic bioassay technology to be used for medical diagnostics,
    precision health and point of care patient care. Ultrasensitive detection of low-concentration
    biomarkers, many of which are currently undetectable by existing technology, offers
    new diagnostic capability for improved clinical decisions and better patient health.
    Existing high-sensitivity diagnostic instruments are very complex to use, expensive
    and require lengthy sample processing steps - all of which increase health care
    costs. A new class of magnetic-based assays combining high sensitivity and low
    sample processing using NV diamond quantum sensors has been developed. Magnetic
    assay platforms can deliver equivalent results to current biomarker assays faster
    and at significantly lower cost. A dramatic reduction in sample processing, combined
    with direct detection of magnetic tags, will provide rapid test results, a critical
    component for point of care diagnostics. A remaining challenge for this approach
    is delivering bioassay samples to the sensor quickly and repeatedly - a challenge
    to be addressed in this project. \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
    Phase I project will develop a rapid sample transfer mechanism to enhance the
    sample throughput of bioassays using a quantum magnetic sensor. Quantum sensing
    enables revolutionary magnetic sensitivity and spatial resolution in a modality
    compatible with biological samples. However, the sample must be delivered close
    to the diamond sensor for analysis, and transfer between samples must occur in
    seconds, all while maintaining sensing performance. Prototype sample transfer
    systems designed and fabricated in this project will implement an innovative new
    process to rapidly transition between assay samples. The hardware will be compact,
    require little power, and be manufacturable at low cost. Prototype sample transfer
    hardware developed in Phase I will form the basis for subsequent engineering of
    quantum sensor based bioassay devices, with initial applications to the research
    use only (RUO) sector, and later to clinical in vitro diagnostics. This advance
    will bridge the gap between the capabilities of quantum magnetic sensing and the
    sample throughput needs of clinical applications."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to expand the capability of modern computer systems to execute machine learning applications and enable new uses of machine learning in the everyday lives of people.  Due to widespread success, machine learning is being applied to automate tasks across most modern businesses.  However, the increasingly computationally complex and data intensive nature of these new problems is rapidly increasing. The scale of current problems stress the computational abilities and memory requirements of modern systems.  The technology to be developed under this Phase I project, will enable computer systems with radically higher performance and energy-efficiency while performing these machine learning tasks.  Enabling efficient machine learning will enable complex tasks to fit within modern mobile devices while simultaneously enabling computers within datacenters to solve increasingly large problems.  Finally, as businesses rush to deploy hardware for machine learning, the underlying algorithms and techniques are rapidly evolving.  The technology to be developed is highly adaptable, enabling high efficiency on current machine learning techniques while mitigating risks for businesses likely to adapt new machine learning algorithms.

    The proposed project introduces a new hardware architecture for the execution of data and control intensive machine learning workloads.  As machine learning has expanded in use, increasing data sizes have brought about the use of compressed data representations.  However, modern computational devices like microprocessors or graphics processors are highly inefficient when working on problems using these compressed representations due to irregular control and data access patterns.  This Phase I project introduces an adaptable architecture that excels at irregular computing and can dynamically re-allocate resources to hasten execution.  To demonstrate the capabilities of the new architecture, key execution kernels from modern machine learning applications will be adapted and developed to operate on compressed representations.  An existing simulation infrastructure will be extended to model key hardware requirements and gather performance estimations of the newly proposed hardware architectures.  Preliminary estimates demonstrate that multiple factors of improvement in energy efficiency and performance are expected across the key operations of machine learning applications.

    to promote academic achievement, high school graduation and college and life preparedness
    for adolescents (middle through college students) with Executive Function (EF)
    deficits.  EF deficits are found in a variety of neurodevelopmental and medical
    disorders including Traumatic Brain Injury, Epilepsy, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity
    Disorder (ADHD), the most common childhood behavioral disorder affecting up to
    10% of youth as well as Autism Spectrum Disorder.  Youth with EF deficits struggle
    to get things done and have high school graduation, college matriculation and
    college graduation rates well below national norms.  In addition, these adolescents
    suffer from anxiety, depression, job loss, substance use and suicide at higher
    rates than their peers without EF deficits.  Research supports incentive-based
    behavioral EF remediation for deficient populations.  But availability of research-based
    EF remediation support is limited.  The proposed technology aims at enabling students
    to develop the EF skills needed to reach their academic potential and improve
    their life outcomes. The broader impact of this research is to gather rich data
    that will advance the scientific and public understanding of technology as a means

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop new low cost, high performance tooling materials for composite manufacturing. The use of advanced fiber reinforced composites in aircraft has become a necessity to achieve higher performance and greater fuel efficiencies.  Boeing?s 787 and Airbus?s A350 are two such aircraft that exemplify the push to increase composite content above 50% by weight.  There is a similar push in other transportation vehicles as well. A large opportunity exists for RTM process technology to reduce costs and streamline composite manufacturing operations.  Phase I results will have a large impact on the composites industry through cost reduction and manufacturing efficiency gains. It will allow a broader manufacturing base to produce composite parts.  Society will see benefits through the broader use of fuel efficient composites in air and land based vehicles.  The technology developed can generate $10-$20M in annual revenue within 5 years of the program end. This effort will also foster collaboration between Advanced Ceramics Manufacturing and large aerospace manufacturers.  Undergraduates at the University of Arizona and local high school students will have an opportunity to work on the project.  Results of this research will be disseminated in multidisciplinary conferences and journals.

    The intellectual merit of this project is developing low cost materials and manufacturing processes that enable composite materials to be produced in high rate resin transfer molding (RTM). Compared to autoclave based processes, RTM offers several key advantages.  This includes: high internal and external geometric complexity, less waste, lower volatile emissions, higher production rates, and excellent surface finish.  However, the injection of high pressure ? high temperature resin presents a tooling challenge.  Tooling can be a limiting factor for utilizing RTM as the preferred manufacturing route. A large opportunity exists for new tooling technology that can withstand RTM conditions and be easily extracted from the composite after the cure cycle.  A soluble RTM capable material will allow RTM applications to grow and reduce the cost of composite manufacturing. The project will develop a new soluble binder-aggregate system that can withstand all RTM process conditions.  The results of the Phase I will demonstrate a low cost RTM compatible tooling system that can be formed at high rate and used in high rate composite RTM cycles.

    This SBIR Phase I project aims to develop degradable zwitterionic hydrogels (DZH) as injectable soft tissue fillers. Fillers are used to replenish volumes left by surgical procedures, medical disorders, trauma, or aging. There is great need for a filler featuring superior longevity to the market-leading hyaluronic acid (HA) products, while also exhibiting better safety and reversibility than existing synthetic products. Zwitterionic hydrogels are uniquely biocompatible, physiologically stable, and can be processed into tunable injectable formulations. The key milestone targeted in this Phase I project is the achievement of proof-of-concept DZH materials that can be selectively and safely degraded with enzymes while maintaining their differentiating strengths: biocompatibility, longevity, and cost-effective production. Successful commercialization of DZH fillers will provide patients with a safe, long-lasting, cost-effective, and reversible treatment, positioning these fillers as a universal replacement for all currently available product lines. A disruptive product in the multibillion-dollar aesthetic filler market would form a solid basis for a sustainable business and ultimately enable the development and commercialization of many next-generation biomedical products.

    This project intends to show that DZH formulations based on zwitterionic polymers can meet key requirements of a next-generation injectable tissue filler. If technical targets are met, DZH products will be transformative as the first universal, long-term, and reversible tissue fillers for therapeutic and aesthetic applications. Specifically, their biocompatibility, rheological properties, selective degradability and aesthetic outcomes must meet or exceed the benchmark HA fillers, while their longevity must show key improvement over benchmark products. The main R&D activities are: (I) synthesizing and identifying strong DZH candidates based on particular gel network architectures; (II) demonstrating selective DZH degradability with minimal breakdown by tissue-specific endogenous enzymes; and (III) evaluating proof-of-concept DZH fillers to ensure they meet or exceed the biocompatibility and viscoelasticity benchmarks of HA products. DZH biocompatibility and selective degradation will be studied in vitro to prepare for preclinical in vivo studies in Phase II.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project will be the development of a detection assay to reduce the incidence of Vibrio-related infections. Infections from Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Vibrio vulnificus are the leading causes of seafood-borne infections and fatalities, respectively, and stem primarily from raw oysters. Development and implementation of rapid, accurate, inexpensive and easy-to-use testing methods would expand Vibrio data collection and enhance preventive measures by state shellfish labs (monitor harvest areas), and oyster processors and post-harvest processors (quality control at facilities). The assays will be available to users in simple, ready-to-prepare kits. These kits will make it easy for non-specialized personnel to test oyster lots still under refrigeration without disrupting logistics, and help U.S. oyster processors and post-harvest processors improve risk management tools and access export markets with restrictions on Vibrio levels. The tests also will improve environmental risk evaluations for harvest areas by state shellfish labs, FDA, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and other members of the National Shellfish Sanitation Program. The tests will be marketed in the U.S., and other large oyster producing nations.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to develop two-phase, thermostable test tube media formulations for the detection and enumeration of pathogenic V. parahaemolyticus, total V. parahaemolyticus, and V. vulnificus in oysters. The goal is to demonstrate a) > 95% sensitivity and specificity of each test with pure cultures and oyster samples; b) 24-hr detection time; c) ease-of-use of the ready-to-prepare kits, based on time, steps, equipment, materials and feedback from industry; and d) low cost. The main technical hurdles are: 1) Increasing formulation volumes for test tube assays since linear increases of agar layer volumes in test tube media formulations could impact Vibrio organism motility, and consequently detection speed and accuracy; and 2) replacing a non-heat stable antibiotic component, Polymixin B of the V. vulnificus test, with a heat stable alternative, like ampicillin or lincomycin, to improve ease-of-use.

    These include antireflective and self-cleaning coatings for solar modules, novel
    electrical contacts that reduce silver usage in solar cells, and thermal barrier
    coatings for windows that increase thermal efficiency. Each of these represents
    a large addressable market in need of coatings innovation: For example, the coated

    coatings from this project are anticipated to capture at least 10% of that market.
    Beyond the commercial and related societal impacts of the project, this project
    will increase the scientific understanding of the nucleation of nanomaterials
    in the gas phase and the subsequent manipulation of nanoparticles in low-pressure
    flows. \n\nThe intellectual merit of this project lies in its development of a
    new method to synthesize metal-oxide materials in the gas phase, resulting in
    an aerosol that can be manipulated and deposited on a substrate with gas flows.
    Prior art for the synthesis of metal-oxide nanoparticles and the subsequent formation
    of films suffers from three challenges: (1) synthesis methods that utilize high-pressure
    gas-phase processes tend to create large light-scattering agglomerates that produce
    hazy films, (2) \"wet\" synthesis coating techniques can suffer from stability
    challenges, optical non-uniformities, and processes that are not easily scaled
    and (3) all methods have limited control of the optical properties of the film,
    specifically the refractive index. Synthesis of metal-oxide nanoparticles using
    the approach in this project is a promising, but under-examined and under-utilized,
    technique. It will generate unagglomerated nanoparticles of controllable size,
    overcoming the first challenge, and, with suitable aerosol deposition techniques,
    enable large-area uniform films with controllable refractive index, overcoming
    the second and third challenges.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission

    under development in this project is an easy-to use, personalized mobile application
    that catches disease degeneration early, tracks patient health history, and provides
    decision support to guide patients to the right medical care at the right time.
    COPD is one of the leading chronic conditions driving potentially avoidable hospital
    admissions. Pairing a mobile health management app with a smart triage system
    that provides instant healthcare guidance has the potential to dramatically reduce
    unnecessary COPD hospitalization and provide long-term maintenance treatment of

    can empower patients to make better health decisions early. \n\nThis STTR Phase
    I project proposes to demonstrate positive impact and adoption of a mobile triage
    application for COPD patients. To date, a set of triage algorithms has been built
    and validated on simulated patient cases. The algorithms exhibited performance
    that is comparable to or better than a panel of board-certified pulmonologists.
    The next vital step is to establish the technical feasibility of a packaged, stand-alone
    mobile application. This research will focus on developing a fully featured prototype
    that is optimized for adoption, retention, and efficacy. A mix of user feedback
    and rigorous usage analysis collected through human testing will provide necessary
    insights on barriers to use, missing functionality, and consumer value. Standardized
    markers of health safety, symptom escalations, and patient quality-of-life will
    be used as metrics of product performance. Moreover, all data and conclusions
    will be subjected to peer review through publication and public presentations.
    As an additional objective, the accuracy of the algorithmic triage recommendations
    will be tested on real patient cases to further validate their accuracy and effectiveness.
    The anticipated result of the phase I procedure is demonstration that the app

    is a sustainable fruit and vegetable processing technology utilizing a new, low
    temperature technique that can extend the shelf life of pre-cut fruits and vegetables
    by months without using preservatives, chemicals, freezing, or refrigeration.
    \ The technology would enable: all-natural, shelf stable fruit and vegetable products
    that retain maximum nutritional value, texture, and taste.  With significant percentages
    of the total US national energy budget used for food-related energy, and high
    fresh produce loss in the developed countries due to insufficient refrigeration,
    achieving shelf life extension without cold storage or preservatives could drastically
    reduce energy costs, increase efficiency, and expand access to nutrition globally.
    \n\nThis STTR Phase I project proposes to develop, validate, and build-upon initial
    research to evaluate the feasibility and scope of a novel food processing technology.
    Traditional processing methodologies have fundamental drawbacks.  High temperature
    treatments degrade nutritional quality while altering texture and taste of end-products.
    Freezing negatively affects the reconstitution properties of fruits and vegetables,
    and requires high energy consumption throughout the food system to maintain the
    cold chain.  HPP (high pressure processing) has limitations on the enzymes it
    can inactivate, and chemical alterations from high pressure treatment negatively
    affects texture and taste.  This research proposal will use validation studies
    to evaluate the feasibility and applicability of the novel processing technique
    to a variety of fruits and vegetables.  Successful experimentation will prove
    that the application of dense phase gas at low temperatures can overcome the aforementioned

    improves upon the operational costs of traditional methodologies.\n\nThis award

- abstractText: "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses
    the challenges, inefficiencies and need associated with a rapidly growing precision
    glass optics market. Glass optics are currently used in a wide range of applications
    such as medical devices (scopes, diagnostics, imaging, etc.), defense (ballistic
    windows, missile domes, etc.), consumer electronics (cell phone lenses, smart
    device screens, etc.) and more. The challenge associated with this market is the
    constant need to prototype optical glass lenses during the development phase.
    Today, these glass lenses are prototyped using a combination of grinding and polishing
    processes that are costly and time consuming. The proposed (QET) Quad Element
    Technology could disrupt the glass optics industry, primarily the prototyping
    market estimated at about $300M with a rapid growth of 50% per year. The end result
    would be the much quicker availability of cutting edge technology that utilizes
    glass optics. An example would be significantly improving the arthroscopic or
    endoscopic surgical tools that drastically minimizes patient trauma and recovery
    time during a surgical procedure or even enabling remote surgery for patients
    especially in third world countries. Other societal benefits will be directly
    realized through economic growth, providing a competitive edge, and improving
    product quality and profitability.             \n\nThe intellectual merit of this
    project is to enable an innovative high productivity approach to manufacturing
    optical quality glass. The objective of this proposal is to demonstrate proof
    of concept and determine the feasibility of combining four (4) distinct elements
    in a single machining process: mechanical, chemical, photonic and thermal. The
    proposed technology, termed QET (Quad Element Technology), is the first of its
    kind in machining processes to exploit the advantages of the four elements specifically
    for material removal. Till date, these four elements have been used consecutively
    in status quo machining processes but never concurrently. The ability of extracting
    and optimizing only the advantages of these four elements will enable a faster
    (6-8x) and cheaper (3-5x) precision manufacturing process to produce glass optics.
    The primary goal of the Phase I R&D is to successfully select and optimize individual
    components for each of the four elements proposed and demonstrate a precision
    turning process on optical glass.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) project is the reduction of the cost of wind energy through a
    robust, inexpensive, and efficient vertical-axis wind turbine (VAWT). This project
    has the potential to increase global wind power production through technological
    advancements that lower installation, operations, and maintenance costs via an
    innovative design which addresses reliability and efficiency concerns that have
    previously limited the penetration of VAWTs into the wind energy market. Compared
    to the common horizontal-axis wind turbine (HAWT), the proposed technology requires
    an order of magnitude fewer components. Additionally, heavy and maintenance intensive
    components are located at ground level for ease of access. One initial market
    for this technology will be stand-alone, small-scale generation, where this technology
    will provide long-lasting, low-maintenance power for remote locations. Another
    initial market is the repowering and augmentation of existing wind turbine arrays.
    Here, this technology will be a cost effective method of revitalizing underperforming
    or aging HAWT farms. The long-term objective is large-scale, VAWT-only arrays.
    Recent scientific advances indicate that, unlike HAWTs, interactions between VAWTs
    can be beneficial, resulting in cost-effective, high-output wind farms. \n\nThis
    SBIR Phase I project proposes to address the reliability and efficiency concerns
    that have previously limited the penetration of VAWTs into the wind energy market.
    XFlow Energy's novel design utilizes a robust, stationary central shaft extending
    the length of the rotor, reducing harmful loading to the rotor structure. This
    design requires a larger central shaft than VAWTs tested to date, and the impact
    of a large central shaft on VAWT power output has not been previously investigated.
    Laboratory-scale tests will be performed on a range of geometries to analyze the
    fluid-dynamic impact of larger central shafts and the resulting changes in turbine
    performance and loading. This information will inform the design and structural
    simulation of a 500 W turbine.  This design will be prototyped and will undergo
    thorough performance measurements. Ultimately destructive testing will be performed
    to identify structural deficiencies, and the design updated appropriately. The
    objective of SBIR Phase I is to produce a 500 W turbine that is thoroughly characterized,
    can survive up to 100 mph winds, and is ready for commercialization. This design
    will inform development of a utility-scale turbine (>50 kW) which will be the
    focus of SBIR Phase II.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will result from the development of a scalable, enterprise-ready conversational AI platform that enables businesses to automate customer support requests, optimize call routing efforts to get customers to the right human support agent, generate customer self-service resources like smart FAQs, augment human staff with bot capabilities, and enable personalized recommendations to support sales and purchasing decisions for customers. Such technology is beneficial to any enterprise organization, B2C (business-to-consumer) and B2B (business-to-business), who needs to communicate to customers, employees, and the public. With rising customer service and communication costs, automation is critical for businesses to maintain profitability and competitive advantages. On a societal level, conversational interfaces democratize access to information and resources worldwide. A significant portion of the world's population lives in regions where internet access is poor and device ownership is rare. Many also suffer from physical limitations, such as impaired vision or limited motor control. Accelerating technology access through conversational interfaces such as SMS and voice has already been shown to transform quality of life for disadvantaged groups through applications in telemedicine, personal finance, and education.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to enable human-level conversational ability in machines. Teaching computers to communicate like humans is a critical step to achieving human-level machine intelligence (HLMI), also called artificial general intelligence (AGI). Current state-of-the-art approaches to automated dialog systems use a combination of supervised learning and reinforcement learning implemented with deep neural network architectures. These approaches have shown promise on toy problems in academic research, but have mixed performance in enterprise settings. This Phase 1 project extends current deep learning approaches by developing a repeatable methodology for annotating and preparing enterprise data for use in dialog systems and a scalable, grounded neural network architecture that can reference external knowledge sources with minimal manual engineering.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to transform 2-way, mobile satellite communications from a niche service (affordable to less than 0.1% of the world?s people), to a broadly accessible mass market product (at costs well under $1/month).  Communications devices (that could be as small as vehicle key fobs) will communicate modest volumes of data to and from virtually anywhere on Earth.   The number of potential applications is large, with the following being a few examples:  every lifejacket on every commercial aircraft and cruise ship could transmit its location and status (in the event of a mishap); children and the elderly could be tracked globally; and drivers could be assured of assistance wherever they travel.   Secondary impacts would include an increase in average fuel efficiency when, for example, more vehicles are sold without spare tires (as drivers have more peace-of-mind regarding the possibility of being stranded).   The United States will benefit in terms of improved safety, conserved resources, stimulus to the satellite and related industries, and increased export revenues.

    The proposed project centers around a combination of innovations that exploit inherent (but previously unutilized) capabilities of existing satellites.  Currently operational Mobile Satellite Systems have communications architectures that do not lend themselves to low-cost transmission of small volumes of data.  By starting with a blank sheet of paper and rethinking the architecture, costs can be reduced by orders of magnitude (for both the communications devices and the data service).  The cost reduction of the terminal devices is primarily driven by lower data rates (with associated lower power and size).  While most technical aspects of communications links improve with lower data rates, one characteristic emerges as a constraint on the extent to which data rate can be reduced.  The purpose of this research is to study this characteristic, called phase noise, and its impact on the communications performance at low data rates when using real satellite links.  The results of this research will be quantitative conclusions regarding the trades between data rates, the cost impact of lowering phase noise in the communication elements, transmission performance, and the modem architectural options.  This study will enable optimization of this trade when developing the follow-on commercial products.

    This SBIR Phase I project seeks to commercialize a suite of gaze-driven training games that are designed to train attention orienting, focus, and inhibitory control. These video games are played with one's eyes, instead of a mouse or a touchscreen. By combining the gaze-driven aspect with embedded training principles, the games are uniquely effective in training attention. Attention is a foundational cognitive skill that is essential for academic success, much like reading is foundational to learning other subjects. The proposed project will result in a stand-alone system for elementary and middle schools to use in both special education and standard education programs for training attention control in children with attentional focus challenges. This product is particularly applicable for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and those with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), because their academic performance suffers from their attentional challenges. A key technical innovation for this project is the development of a suite of assessments that provide feedback on student performance on par with validated laboratory assessments of attention. The in-game assessments will be validated against the laboratory standards. At the end of this project, the suite of intervention and assessment games will be ready to deploy for testing in school settings as part of a SBIR Phase II project.


    Attention skill lies at the foundation of cognitive control and one's ability to scaffold successful classroom learning, yet existing laboratory tools to accurately measure attention's many facets are out of reach of the teachers and educators on the frontlines. This SBIR Phase I project brings innovation to the standard methods of attention assessment by creating easy to use assessment tasks that attract the attention of school children and whose validity will be compared to gold-standard lab assessments. This will make accurate assessment of attentional function more reliable even when delivered without an assessment expert present, and this project opens the market for attention training games that can show unbiased, quantitative improvement. This innovation will be broadly useful to allow a wide range of individuals to assess attention, but this specific project seeks to commercialize lab-quality attention intervention games for use by educators in schools with a software suite featuring interleaved assessment and training. This approach will provide feedback for school staff as well as ensure that the next steps in attention training are appropriate for the learner's current skill.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will investigate the use of novel photo-switchable adhesives in medical dressings to improve patient safety, hospital compliance and potentially change the standard of care in the field of adhesive dressings. The proposed work differs drastically from other research endeavors to create dismantlable adhesives, whose drawbacks include high costs, difficulty to scale, biocompatibility issues, and inability to effect switching in application within short times. This new research offers advantages of significantly lower costs and easier scale-up using readily available adhesive industry infrastructure. Medical adhesive dressings that easily lose peel adhesion addresses a significant unmet need for preventing medical adhesive related skin injuries (MARSI), a prevalent but under-recognized injury that affects 7% of all patients across all age groups and healthcare settings. MARSI causes about 1.5 million injuries annually in the US alone and it is estimated that MARSI caused $850M in payments withheld to hospitals due to low patient satisfaction. This project is pursing the creation of a medical dressing that addresses these concerns while being cost competitive, easy to use and most importantly, safe to the patient's skin. Prototype medical dressings will be characterized and tested based on customer requirements.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project presents a novel adhesive technology platform where use-case characteristics at application are decoupled from end of life/removal characteristics through photo-switching. Photo-switchable medical adhesive dressings that lose peel adhesion upon application of light address a significant unmet need for preventing medical adhesive related skin injuries (MARSI), a prevalent but under-recognized injury that affects 7% of all patients across all age groups and healthcare settings. The proposed work differs drastically from other research endeavors to create dismantlable adhesives as the proprietary photo-switchable molecules enable change in human safe conditions and in short time frames. The proposed Phase 1 SBIR project would evaluate different proprietary multifunctional crosslinkers to increase the speed of the photo-switch by about 50% to meet clinician needs. This would be followed by experimentally evaluating methodologies to fabricate adhesive lined films for optimal optical switchability at different thicknesses and for different substrates. Finally, the learnings from the above two steps about adhesive coated films will be combined with an existing skincare lamp to demonstrate proof of product. Product performance will be characterized and tested to optimize performance based on customer requirements.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to establish faster, less expensive, more accurate ways of determining the contents of biological samples leading to novel medical diagnostics, new drugs, and other new products beyond the reach of the current scientific methods that employ mass spectrometry. The project will develop technology that enables better software for mass spectrometry, and will make mass spectrometry-based sample analysis more accessible to a broader segment of academic and industrial scientists, disrupting a $100M market. Advanced software is required to transform raw experimental data into the lists of molecules and quantities needed to create new drugs, discover diseases and increase food production. The successful completion of the aims of this proposal will enable the development of software built for the next generation of mass spectrometry, providing user-friendly, fast cloud software built on advanced, high-information algorithms.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop novel, high-information software technology for mass spectrometry data processing. The proposed work in Phase I will provide proof-of-concept for prototype development and testing in Phase II. The research will address three critical technical hurdles that are prerequisites to prototype development: 1) A mass spectrometry data storage and retrieval architecture sufficient to handle significantly more information from the hundreds of files in a typical study, 2) cloud-optimized versions of mass spectrometry information extraction algorithms, and 3) a cloud-based model-view controller framework that overcomes web-specific challenges for mass spectrometry data processing. The goal is to allow more experiments in the same amount of time without increasing costs, identifying more molecules than existing methods from the same experiment, and detecting molecules that are less abundant and go undetected by current methods.

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project will serve two complementary unmet market needs
    by: (1) accelerating the evaporation rate of brine ponds and enhancing salt production
    efficiency by 2-3 times; (2) condensing the moisture evaporated from contaminated/salty
    water so that one can obtain clean drinking water with n consumption of electricity.
    We will develop an enhanced solar vapor generation strategy based on a patent-pending
    electricity-free solar thermal technology. Specifically, we will develop/optimize
    functional materials to enhance the solar-driven vapor generation rate. The target
    is to double or even triple the salt production of mining companies relying on
    evaporation of brine ponds exposed to natural sun and wind. We will work with
    selected industrial partners to perform the field test in lithium brine ponds,
    which is the key source material for future Lithium battery industry. In addition,
    by condensing the evaporated moisture, we will aim to produce clean water using
    low cost materials and systems, which is a promising and sustainable solution
    to address the global drinking water scarcity using affordable electricity-free
    products in coastal and resource-limited areas. \n\nThe proposed project will
    aim to commercialize a patent-pending technology to realize an enhanced solar-driven
    water evaporator, which is highly desired for both solar mining production and
    clean water generation. Due to the superior solar energy absorption, heat conversion,
    and thermal insulating properties of our disclosed structure, most of the absorbed
    energy can be used to evaporate surface water with significantly reduced thermal
    dissipation. Remarkably, our pilot system has realized a record solar thermal
    conversion efficiency of >88% under illumination of 1 kW/m2 with no solar concentration.
    The corresponding vapor generation rate is ~1.28 kg/m2/h - a full 3X higher than
    the natural evaporation of bare water surfaces in the same environment. This Phase
    I SBIR effort will aim to overcome the remaining technical barriers for material
    and system optimization and scaling up strategies for manufacturing. By comparing
    the roll-to-roll coating and direct dying processes in this proposed research,
    we will select the best overall technology to complete our supply chain for the
    production in Phase II. In particular, we will perform field tests by working
    with solar mining industrial partners as well as Non-Government Organizations
    (NGO's) to get their feedback on how to improve the product in relevant environment. "

    This SBIR Phase I project will examine a new ultra-rapid 3D printing technology designed to break down important barriers to the future of Additive Manufacturing. The subject is a machine and materials set that can provide exponentially faster object generation at high resolution. This system leverages several familiar technologies in a new way to provide a path for 3D printing, generally considered reserved for the high-tech sectors, to become accessible to everyone. Because the new method is so rapid, detailed, and the materials are so diverse, it is poised to enhance plastics manufacturing profit margins by eliminating mold costs in many cases. In this way, many American business forced to outsource overseas will be able to maintain domestic production and increase the return of manufacturing jobs to the US. In addition, the manufacturing of the consumables will also enhance job creation. When this new method is fully adopted, its use in the medical field will make lifesaving and life enhancing prosthetic, implantable, and pharmaceutical testing applications much more cost effective, fundable by Medicare, benefiting all our citizens. By servicing a higher percentage of the general plastics manufacturing $600B industry, as well as professional designers, engineers, technical professionals, and the medical and scientific community, the new system in its many forms will eventually be of benefit to nearly every industry in the US, increasing the growth and practical value of the 3D market sector.


    The subject invention is unique in its use of multiple disciplines simultaneously. As a solid-state system, pressure-biased build material presses up against a glass screen, which is micro-porous, and is laced with the same kind of electronics as are found in flat screen displays. The discrete addressing normally reserved for video images, known as row-and-column refresh rates, is instead used to activate resistive material generating micro-heat spots in this open weave configuration. The heat stimulates the build material to transit the glass and solidify topside, at 1000 dpi resolution, or 1 million droplets per square inch. These high-resolution droplets conjoin and cool, as an entire layer is created at once at 30-120 times a second with no mechanical heads tracking back and forth. The objects should seem to simply appear on the glass at about one to seven vertical inches per minute, depending on the refresh rate, at virtually any planar size, and can be used right away, since no post-curing treatment is needed. Integrating an activated video matrix to build entire cross sections at once, increases speed exponentially. The pores in the glass rely on the known science of Microfluidics, a highly refined means of moving an entire 2D matrix of liquid, to eliminate costly and slow mechanization, and will be studied in this application. Robust and diverse materials have been developed for many embodiments and will be tested. Optimizing first in Multiphysics simulation, and then fabricating a simplified Proof of Concept in Phase I, should provide compelling evidence for continued work on this novel method in Phase II.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will primarily benefit the 11.4 million people with hand amputations worldwide. By making and selling a prosthetic hand at a price lower than competing devices, the proposed prosthetic hand is expected to be more affordable for people with upper limb amputations. Increasing robustness by incorporating compliant materials should allow patients to use their hands longer without worry of damage. By incorporating pressure sensors, the team expects to enable patients to precisely manipulate many different types of objects. Two former war veterans with amputations have already been enabled with early versions of the proposed technology. Through the low cost of the device and the advanced features unique to the hand, the goal of this project is to help the millions of hand amputees worldwide to regain independence and confidence in their lives through innovative prosthetic devices.

    The proposed project involves development and evaluation of an affordable, robust myoelectric prosthetic hand that provides natural, compliant grasps with pressure feedback to users. Making the hand compliant will require the use of soft, compliant materials not used in currently available commercial prosthetic devices. The design and materials used in the hand must be robust enough to last at least two years of daily usage. Finally, sensorizing the hand will require placing pressure sensors and electronics in the fingers that also need to withstand impacts. Feasibility will be established through the performance of each design iteration in accelerated life tests (150,000 flex/extend cycles) and human subject experiments (performance after activities of daily living and motor control tasks). The capabilities of the Phase I prototype will be extended in Phase II for delivery of a complete myoelectric prosthetic hand system that is ready for clinicians to use with patients.

    This SBIR Phase I project will demonstrate the feasibility of producing ophthalmic lenses utilizing a low cost optical printer that will enable the fabrication of superior quality lenses with a low cost optical printer.  The result is development of a business model where an eye exam is administered, prescription lenses are printed and glasses assembled and dispensed in a single visit.  Upon completing the refraction portion of the eye exam, the lens prescriptions will be electronically transferred to the optical lens printer.  The lens blanks, pre-treated for UV and anti-scratch protection, will contain a laser writable photopolymer layer that accepts and freezes the personalized prescriptions.  Eyeglasses produced with this method will be of equal or higher in optical quality compared to traditional lenses and can be produced at a fraction of the cost of conventional lenses.  This method of producing ophthalmic lenses both reduces the turnaround time for securing eyeglasses but equally important, will significantly reduce the cost for producing eyeglasses translating to lower the retail prices.   Considering that over 60% of the US population wears glasses and a much high percentage of families have members that depend on glasses, this project will benefit the vast majority of US taxpayers.

    The goal of this STTR Phase 1 proposal is to demonstrate the feasibility of three coupled innovations: 1) a high-speed optical printer for 2) photosensitive ophthalmic lens blanks that record 3) novel gradient-index diffractive optics which provide dramatically improved fabrication cost, visual performance and lighter weight over existing lens making technologies.  The target application will be low cost, low and higher order aberration correcting eyeglass lenses fabricated with a compact, inexpensive optical printer.  Lenses produced with this light based process will match or exceed the optical quality of current free form lenses made with computer numerical controlled milling machines costing in the range of $250k to $500k.  This proposed lens making innovation enables the development of an eyeglass dispensing business model that could eliminate the need for conventional centralized eyeglass labs, the associated distribution networks, a comprehensive inventory of lens blanks and the long wait times for procuring prescription eyeglasses.  The developments of this STTR will allow ophthalmic practices to better serve their patients, enabling on-site fabrication of superior corrective lenses that more closely match eye deficiencies.  By the end of phase I, the goal is to optimize the photopolymer materials, refine the light sources and complete an engineering model of the optical printer.

    This SBIR Phase I project will develop an innovative 3D medical imaging technology for early-stage detection and analysis of cancers, initially focusing on detecting pre-cancer cervical lesions. This project will advance from creatively assembling existing active optics hardware to inventing a new microfiber-based active optics system to circumvent limits of space confinement and 3D resolution. The project's fundamental strategy for identifying pre-cancers of the cervix, which relies on a macroscopic 3D digital analysis combined with microscopic cell evaluation, is naturally amenable to artificial intelligence technologies. The versatility of this imaging platform enables the resolving of medical diagnostic challenges in wealthy settings and the resolving of cost-saving barriers in resource-limited settings. The imaging technology can be extended beyond medical practice to other scientific and industrial disciplines. Potentially, this project has an immediate impact on saving lives and costs via the early detection of fatal diseases. Additionally, the data and knowledge acquired developing and implementing this imaging system provide opportunities to meaningfully develop new computational strategies for educational, engineering and industrial interests. The innovative, commercially viable, platform technology offers opportunities for significant, tax-revenue-generating global profits, for future technology application spin-offs, and for producing high technology jobs for U.S. citizens.

    The project innovation will voyage from state-of-the-art 3D software development to the creation of a new type of fiber bundle imager with an electronically controlled actively focusing lens. Combined, these tasks achieve the creation of a miniaturized 3D imaging system capable of navigating confined spaces within the body, such as inside the cervix opening. For all prototypes developed for this project, final 3D renderings are enabled by proprietary 3D rendering software, capable of quantifying tissue color, volume and shape at the macroscopic level, while also evaluating cell size and approximate shape at the microscopic level. In wealthy settings, this system would be desirable for implementing a single-phase cervical cancer screening strategy to replace the current two-phase approach, which requires Pap smear and/or human papilloma virus assay, followed by the more expensive colposcopy in the case of an abnormal result. In resource-limited regions and/or regions with difficult-to-reach populations, where it is challenging to get patients to return for a follow-up visit, the technology would offer a low-cost, pre-screening method that only requires a single visit. This 3D imaging system could be combined in the future with a therapeutic agent administered at the time of diagnosis, thus offering a single-visit, screen-diagnose-and-treat method.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    Research (SBIR) project encompasses the development of a continuous fabrication
    process to enable production of larger volumes of the next generation of agrochemical
    compounds. Although the first focus is on utilization for efficient delivery of
    antimicrobial and antifungal crop protection chemicals, this platform can be applied
    for actives and biologicals with other functionalities. The broader significance
    of this research and development effort entails the following aspects: First,
    in addition to agricultural crop protection products, the delivery system developed
    here is expected to find commercial applications in many products targeted to
    the consumer, construction markets, and healthcare. Second, the formulation of
    benign small structures that have the potential to replace a wide range of persistent
    and harmful nanoparticles in various industrial settings will enhance scientific
    and technological understanding of scalable processes on the nanoscale. Third,
    the sustainable solutions developed in this project could strengthen existing
    natural resources, enhance biosecurity of the U.S. food supply, and improve public
    health. \n\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes to engineer an innovative system
    for efficient delivery of agricultural actives. To increase productivity, current
    agricultural practices utilize large amounts of crop protection chemicals. However,
    the intensive use of agrochemicals creates environmental threats damaging natural
    resources and potentially causing climate change. To address these challenges
    we are developing innovative, breakthrough platform technology with potential
    to increase efficiency of farming with the same or fewer inputs, while protecting
    the environment. The goal of this work is to create a new class of scalable, functionally
    active, sustainable and eco-friendly materials based on the widely available,
    biodegradable and bio-renewable resource lignin. The first objective of the project
    is to build a continuous flow process for preparation of lignin particles functionalized
    with small amounts of active biocides. This research will establish feasibility
    for continuous formulation of these preparations. The second objective of the
    study includes characterization of the new formulations using a series of antimicrobial
    and antifungal assays. As a result of the Phase 1 effort, technical risk will
    be reduced by identifying the most promising formulations for field studies to
    be conducted in Phase 2."

    This SBIR Phase I project will study novel methods for extracting and recovering valuable metals from an abundant industrial waste source, namely coal combustion fly ash. If successful, the technology developed in this project has the potential to reduce the environmental and societal risks of both newly generated- and legacy coal combustion wastes, while strengthening the supply chain security of raw materials critical to advanced technology and green energy applications. Moreover, by establishing a secure long-term supply of affordable scandium, this project can catalyze long-lasting improvements in commercial and personal transportation. Demonstration of this highly-selective, solvent-free metal separations technology may also influence a paradigm shift in the metallurgical industry towards more sustainable practices. Validation of technologies for waste utilization and value creation is an attractive avenue for transitioning coal-dependent regions towards economies based on advanced manufacturing and high-tech jobs.

    Previous attempts to extract metals from industrial wastes have suffered from technical limitations that the technology developed in this project overcomes. Based on commercially-available engineered polymer supports, our suite of adsorbents exhibits REE-selective functionality across broad pH regimes, enabling flexible, complementary deployment and high rates of reagent recycle. The goals of this project are to translate the laboratory-scale synthesis schemes for our novel adsorbents to greener, industrially-scalable chemistries and to demonstrate a holistic system prototype that validates the key unit operations of our process together. The former will be accomplished by following well-established protocols of the chemical industry under the supervision of our commercial partner and the latter through extensive, dynamic subsystem testing and finally construction and operation of a lab-scale prototype. The project team expects the final deliverable of this development effort to constitute a high-fidelity demonstration of the process at a Technology Readiness Level of 5.

    This SBIR Phase II project deals with the development of a gamified educational platform meant to excite and inspire children to learn about the sciences through the medium of cooking. By engaging students with interactive content in K-8 classrooms, after school programs, and special education settings, the proposed innovation aims to simultaneously accomplish three outcomes that are important to K-8 students' education and healthy living. These outcomes include: (1) helping students develop a highly practical skill (cooking), (2) generating excitement about and enhancing learning in several scientific disciplines (particularly nutrition science, STEM, and human geography), and (3) promoting a highly desirable behavior in students (the development of healthy eating habits). This project proposes to develop a prototype version of the innovative educational technology. It builds upon an existing proof-of-concept application that integrates nutrition science (in the form of cooking recipes) with human geography (different countries and cultures) and significantly enhances this application by innovatively linking the cooking-related content to a STEM curriculum and testing the addition of a variety of capabilities meant to increase user engagement and learning through the application. This Phase I proposal will research the feasibility and usability of the product, and investigate the extent to which the proposed technology is able to simultaneously achieve the three stated outcomes in a way that outperforms traditional paper-based school curricula. With the market for mobile learning products valued at $12.2 billion, the company's three-pronged approach to improving learning and health-related outcomes for K-8 students stands to generate significant revenue. The team estimates that the business can reach roughly 2 million in sales in the first three years following the product?s launch.

    The proposed research will explore (1) various ways for the system to automatically link cooking concepts with STEM concepts in a way that enhances learning and engagement and produces a curriculum compliant with Next Generation Science Standards, (2) the application of emotional intelligence to data gathered, such that the technology will track students? mood and food choices, and provide suggestions based on an optimal match between the two, and (3) the use of adaptive learning to effectively deliver the above curriculum in a targeted and personalized manner (including accommodations for children with special needs during Phase II). These outcomes will be achieved by creating and testing new capabilities for the system, including the ability to monitor user performance, a points-based progression system, personalization, customized STEM games, and matching students with recipes and lesson plans based on their culinary preferences and emotional moods, the majority of which will be implemented via the use of machine learning. Overall, the goal of the small business is to develop several different app features that incorporate the above-mentioned approaches, and to determine, through repeated and rigorous classroom testing with K-8 students, which combination of features maximizes the learning and behavioral outcomes that the application is targeting.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is the development of a cost-effective, environmental and economically sound Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) production facility based on a finite number of horseshoe crabs (HSC) using minimally impactful and novel bleeding procedures.  The goal is to address the demands of an estimated $114 million LAL market and finished kit market in excess of $1 billion per annum. Success of this project also anticipates exceeding current standards by ensuring biomedical and pharmaceutical manufacturing compliance with fewer total horseshoe crabs than the number that die annually from current practices. New approaches to HSC bleeding developed in this project would also enable repeated, controlled bleeding while maintaining optimal conditions for animal vitality and for the adjacent communities. Assuming optimized, scalable HSC bleeding operations could eventually expand current supplies, innovative applications could be developed. For example, early detection of sepsis could help avert some $30 billion in direct care every year in the US, notwithstanding the potential to save countless lives with development of gram-negative screening tools for hospital acquired septicemia.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop an alternative method of bleeding horseshoe crabs (HSCs) for Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) harvest. The overarching objective to demonstrate the proof-of-concept of an implantable, and surgical-grade device engineered to facilitate routine bleeding, without compromising the integrity and well-being of the HSC. This will be achieved via a systematic study of HSC bleeding outcomes to investigate whether such a device can meet the sterility and quality standards of traditional approaches, while obviating the need for extraneous transport to expensive, inland bleeding facilities. Furthermore, the commercial opportunity and feasibility of the device paired with a habitat-based, enclosed system to systematically monitor HSC wellbeing will be investigated. This SBIR Phase I project would be the first to investigate an alternative approach to bleeding HSCs, a technique that has not changed significantly since the late 1800's. At scale, the proposed approach would also be expected to improve product quality and traceability, and ultimately the bottom line of companies producing LAL kits, given a surplus of LAL in the supply chain.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to make non-pharmacological treatment of depression accessible to all patients. According to the World Health Organization, 350 million individuals are affected by depression. In the United States, depression affects 16 million people and it costs $210 billion a year in lost productivity and care for the illnesses related to the disease. Antidepressant drugs are coupled with negative side effects and they are ineffective in 30% of the cases. Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) is an FDA approved non-invasive method for depression therapy that consists in the administration of short electromagnetic pulses on patient?s scalp to stimulate regions of the brain involved in mood control. This SBIR Phase I project will help the generation of a new rTMS system that will improve outcomes of depression treatment by stimulating deeper brain cells and reducing the incidence of pain and discomfort associated with current rTMS therapy. The new device will allow broad distribution of rTMS based therapy for both professional clinicians and, in the future, home-care settings. It will avoid reliance on drugs to people affected by depression and it will reduce the impact of depression on society.

    The SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop and demonstrate the efficacy a new wearable rTMS stimulator device. Although rTMS has a 75% success ratio on depressed patients, 40% of subjects report pain, headaches and discomfort during therapy with current rTMS systems, resulting in a high dropout rate. This is mainly due to poor localization of electromagnetic pulses with commercially available rTMS devices. The new system will combine a new technology that stimulates the brain?s deepest regions involved in depression with unprecedented precision and a new protective shield designed to ward off unwanted heat away from the head, reducing scalp pain and discomfort. The project will develop and validate the efficacy of these components and their integration into a wearable helmet. The project will also demonstrate the superiority of the new device over current gold standard rTMS solutions. The company expects that this research will lead to the generation of a new device capable of treating depression patients through precise stimulation reducing over 40% the unwanted heat, thereby preventing headache and scalp discomfort.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project include development of a commercial proof-of-concept percutaneous directional microwave ablation (MWA) applicator which may provide medical practitioners a new approach for treating cancer. In clinical use, a directional MWA applicator will facilitate both procedural and technical simplification of MWA treatments, saving time and critical resources in hospitals, and ultimately improve quality of, and access to, cancer treatment for a broad range of patients. The research and development proposed in this project will enhance scientific and technological understanding of miniaturized MWA antennas capable of radiating with directional patterns. Specifically, special materials to reduce required antenna dimension and increase efficiency, and advanced antenna designs to maximize the size of directional ablation zones will be studied during this project. Commercial development of the proposed technical advances could expand their use for the treatment of other medical conditions or for applications in other industries such as wireless communications. This STTR Phase I project will contribute to the creation of technology jobs in Kansas, a region where there are few medical or technology companies.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to develop a commercial proof-of-concept directional microwave ablation (MWA) applicator. MWA procedures offer cost-effective, minimally-invasive treatment options for localized tumors and other disease. These treatments are especially important to the large population of cancer patients who are poor candidates for surgery or other physically demanding therapies. However, currently available MWA systems employ applicators with omni-directional radiation patterns, which if not placed precisely may damage critical healthy tissues or result in disease recurrence. A directional MWA applicator can facilitate technical and procedural simplifications which to alleviate these current challenges. We will investigate: (1) alternative materials to shrink antenna cross-section and (2) novel antenna geometries to maximize the size of directional microwave ablation zones. We will employ an approach integrating multiphysics computational models, benchtop experimentation in ex vivo tissue, and experiments in animal models in vivo to design, optimize, and validate our device. Our anticipated technical results are the development of a MWA applicator that provides directional control of radiation pattern that can ablate to depths of greater than 30 mm, creating an ablation volume comparable to current clinical non-directional devices.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is an inexpensive handheld smartphone device for rapid detection of the toxigenic cholera pathogen in environmental water sources. Contaminated water sources place populations at risk for contracting cholera. Once contracting the disease, patients with cholera exhibit symptoms of diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration and, if left untreated, ultimately death. Wide-scale cholera outbreaks devastated Haiti in 2010 and Yemen in 2017, affecting over one million total individuals. Currently, methods used to detect the cholera pathogen in water involves a 3 to 5-day water collection and cell culture procedure. This project proposes a portable smartphone platform used to detect the cholera pathogen, Vibrio cholerae, in under 30 minutes at the water source. Smartphone connectivity, will also enable geomapped and time-stamped detection results. This novel and proactive approach for detection can enable organizations to remediate water sources prior to communities contracting and spreading cholera. Downstream, this technology will save the time and costs currently associated with cholera outbreaks and can be expanded to other infectious diseases.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a rapid, cost-effective, and robust smartphone platform to detect Vibrio cholerae and automate the detection result at an environmental water source. The device performs isothermal DNA amplification assay combined with the novel sensing approach, particle diffusometry. This project proposes to characterize the specificity, sensitivity, and lower limit of detection of Vibrio cholerae detection on the smartphone platform. The detection results will be compared against current gold-standard quantitative DNA amplification methods. Further, a reagent storage method involving freeze drying will be used to eliminate the need for cold-chain storage. We will assess the long-term stability of our assay reagents through accelerated aging studies. Lastly, a low powered integrated heating unit will be designed to perform the isothermal DNA amplification assays in the handheld device. At the completion of this Phase I project, an integrated smartphone platform will be ready for field testing.

    chemicals such as sulfur, water, and air, to enable an ultra-low-cost electrochemical
    energy storage system. In Phase I of this SBIR, a prototype air-breathing energy
    storage device will be developed and demonstrated that significantly reduces the
    power cost ($/kW) of this technology. This will be achieved by systematically
    investigating and optimizing the electrochemical active and inactive materials
    and by designing cell and system architectures which are optimized for long-duration
    air-breathing electrochemical systems.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory
    mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's

    This SBIR Phase I project focuses on development of a prototype for a Virtual Music Helper (VMH) for children. Research confirms that music and music learning enhances intelligence, learning and IQ specially in kids. Even children with attention deficit/ hyperactivity disorder benefit from listening to music beforehand in mathematics tests. Children who learn or practice music have shown better results in STEM subjects. However, studies also suggest children opt out of music class based on false belief that they lack musical ability and many kids often find the music practice non-engaging, and boring eventually losing interest and quitting. Parents find it challenging to entice the kids to sit down and practice or they cannot help their kids because either they don?t have time or are not music savvy themselves to help them. The virtual music helper can read the kids? music homework, guide them through the exercise and provide immediate correction. This helper is not to replace teachers, but help the parents at home and encourage kids to practice more. In broader terms this project may spur significant research in finding effective methods for tutoring kids in subjects other than music such as math or language, or for kids with special needs.


    This SBIR Phase I project proposes a Virtual Music Helper (VMH) that is empowered by Artificial Intelligence and Augmented Reality for kids. VMH is a 3D mobile-virtual-human (avatar) that can be personalized for each kid and conduct live dialog with kids both from visual and behavioral perspectives. VHM offers smart content for teachers about each student's progress and weak points. The technical challenges this project will address is the detection and correction of mistakes kids make including polyphonic pitch detection from acoustic instrument, conversion of note sheets to machine readable music format with high accuracy and speed, empowering the avatar with decision making algorithms to provide proper correction and feedback verbally and visually. This platform is also intended to support multiple popular instruments and multiple languages.

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to allow new hardware platforms to be
    more quickly deployed and useful software products to be more readily made available
    on a wide variety of hardware to satisfy the needs of their users.  Additionally,
    researchers in science and engineering can reduce the runtime of their applications

    enabling more scientific modeling and simulations to be completed within these
    centers, while allowing each individual scientist to concentrate more on his/her
    research, which in turn may more quickly benefit society.  For example, in the
    defense industry, many contracting companies develop Monte Carlo simulation software
    to predict outcomes from disasters. Increasing the throughput of these simulations
    would allow for more simulation results to be analyzed and tested, thereby resulting
    in better predictions and handling of disastrous situations. \n\nThis Small Business
    Innovation Research Phase I project is unique in its automated connection between
    existing performance modeling and prediction tools, and pattern-driven compiler
    optimization. Novel runtime monitoring and modeling techniques will be developed
    to automatically map performance bottlenecks discovered by existing performance
    analysis tools to potential opportunities of source code optimizations. Such opportunities
    again will be used to guide pattern-driven compiler optimizations, particularly
    to enhance the performance of finite element methods on both GPGPUs and multi-core/many-core
    CPUs. Deep learning neural networks will be used to automate the runtime behavior
    classification of computations. The new pattern-driven specialization of compiler
    optimizations will enable general-purpose compiler techniques to be aware of the
    higher-level semantics of library abstractions (e.g., data structures and algorithm
    abstractions) and allow them to be collectively customized and coordinated to

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to enable smaller businesses to participate to the chatbot revolution, by making it easier to design and deploy chatbots. The initial focus of this project is healthcare, where there is great opportunity to improve the quality and availability of patient services. The key technological innovation is the facilitation of an ecosystem of chatbot designers and agents, through the creation of novel chatbot design, collaboration and deployment tools.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will create the technology to allow chatbot designers to incorporate human agents into the logical flow of chatbots. Currently, chatbots are designed in an ad-hoc trial-and-error manner, which is infeasible for small businesses who do not have the resources to constantly refine and evaluate their chatbots. The project will also create techniques to allow human agents to be productive when taking over chatbot sessions, and allow designers to improve the logical flow of chatbots based on usage data.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is that it will save billions of dollars by anticipating construction delays and streamlining coordination to prevent them. Lower costs will help upgrade our nation's infrastructure, which is a critical national priority. Many construction companies strongly want a solution to indoor progress monitoring. Laser scanning is too expensive and slow, and photography services can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars for large projects and introduce logistical challenges. The proposed research would simplify the workflow for progress monitoring of interiors by automatically registering 360 degree photos and video and aligning them to building information models (BIM), providing a cheap, quick, and effective solution for daily progress monitoring.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to localize images, reconstruct 3D models, align them to floorplans or 3D BIM, and use the aligned models to provide actionable data to construction managers. A main challenge is to robustly solve for camera pose using structure-from-motion in indoor scenes that are unfinished and contain textureless and reflective surfaces. A second challenge is to automatically or semi-automatically register the models to 2D or 3D plans, made more difficult by the fact that the site is incomplete and constantly changing. A third challenge is to create interfaces that project personnel can use to perform visual inspection, progress monitoring, requests for information, and other supervision and coordination tasks. The project will investigate the use of tags (i.e., markers) to improve robustness of 3D reconstruction and to perform registration without requiring the 3D positions of tags to be known in advance. Thus, the project addresses major unsolved problems in computer vision, robotics, and their application to construction management.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable more efficient access to information, goods, and services from organizations and businesses through conversational interfaces. With an estimated 33 million voice-activated devices installed in the U.S. by the end of 2017, consumers are beginning to see the benefits of the rise in business services on these devices. Interacting with computers in natural language is more efficient than ever before, and business are urgently seeking to include their services on this new modality. Yet, while advances in machine learning have increased the speed and accuracy with which conversational interfaces are built, today's solutions still result in major bottlenecks in the development process. Addressing these bottlenecks would result in significant savings of time and resources for businesses, in addition to increased convenience for end users.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project advances the development of machine learning and natural language processing technologies that will enable rapid creation of conversational interfaces and increase the efficiency with which individuals interact with computers. Despite major recent advances in conversational interface tooling, current bottlenecks in building robust conversational interfaces still exist, as portions of the development process go from highly-automated to manually-programmed. Instead, the proposed approach will achieve end-to-end automation using an innovative LSTM sequence-to-sequence machine learning model to learn and simulate human behavior on a web page, as well as a new system for open-domain question answering.

    This SBIR Phase I project will create a novel educational product by pairing VR/360 video with impact measurement software and interactive social engagement tools to simulate true-to-life experiences that enable users to gain personal insight into pressing social issues and then take action to solve them. Installed either as a multisensory 'empathy exhibition' or used in a classroom setting, participants embark on a transformative learning journey which builds empathy and critical understanding about a social issue and those affected by it, then connects them to concrete opportunities to make social change. Users begin as uniformed participants, and through the proposed process emerge as changemakers engaged in solving social problems. Experiential learning has long been an empathy building discipline outside the mediated experience, yet it is encumbered by barriers of cost, safety, distance, time and access that limit participation. Transformation360 will use technology to render experiential learning programs virtually anywhere. The result will be a revolutionary new way to move the public from apathy to action on a limitless number of social issues. Transformation360 will provide nonprofits, governments, and institutions working to solve social problems with a powerful social engagement tool that creates actively engaged citizens, consumers, volunteers, supporters, and social entrepreneurs to address the world's most pressing social problems.


    This SBIR Phase I project will develop a VR/360 video hybridization that will allow users interactive choices within a conventional three-degree-of-freedom 360 Video experience. Currently only VR's computer-generated imaging can provide a significant choice landscape for users. By using 360/3D photography, unique game engine software and multi-scenario video capture in the field the project will give users a new level of choice options for a photo documentary experiences. The efficacy of this technology for building empathy will be quantified through audience testing. Also, cinematic techniques such as mise-en-cine and montage, not currently used in most 360 video projects, will also be tested against audience reactions. These video production and consumption technologies and techniques will also be cross-tested against experience learning processes such as the breaking down assumptions, peer learning, debriefing, uncertainty, and risk. Potential adverse side effects to VR/360 video will also be addressed. The project will rely heavily on the engagement measurement and data visualization tool Harvis to test and analyze audience reactions to these experiments.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project can be summarized as follows. (1) Businesses will benefit from the proposed product because companies are increasingly using data-driven predictive models to improve their bottom line. In many areas where structured data are readily available, such as credit scoring, these models have produced impressive returns on investment. One of the main obstacles hindering the application of these models in other areas is the lack of structured data. By extracting information from sources such as web pages, blogs and social media messages, and storing it as structured data, companies will be able to take advantage of the vast amount of unstructured data that are generated daily and thereby improve their bottom line. (2) As the Chinese economy expands and becomes more deeply intertwined with the US economy, many US businesses will need high-quality and timely information about Chinese markets. However, information extraction from Chinese text is an underserved area. The proposed product can fill this void and thereby meet a significant commercial demand.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a new information extraction (IE) method. Currently IE focuses on information extraction from short text snippets consisting of a few words in order to derive structured factual information from unstructured text. But its performance is often deteriorated by the shortage of features - the sparse feature problem. A major benefit of the approach developed in this project is that it takes advantage of the important role of specific linguistic units even when the number of words in a sentence is limited. These linguistic units give a sentence its structure. Depending on structural characteristics or functional principles of sentences, the features around them are grouped. The grouped features satisfy certain properties and can be used to capture structural and semantic information, which is helpful for minimizing the sparse feature problem.

    market for this innovation is the high-end bicycle spoke market, which is valued
    at over $100M. The research of new polymeric materials at universities is at an
    all-time high. Despite this, there exists a gap in the commercialization of new
    materials because of the difficulty in interfacing these materials to other common
    construction materials, such as stainless steel. This work will contribute fundamental

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to use controversy detection to support financial institutions' ability to reduce their risks and increase profits. This is part of a growing trend towards "alternative data" products relying on artificial intelligence and machine learning. Besides the financial industry, there are numerous potential applications of controversy detection technology in a variety of market verticals, such as crisis management, defense applications, and advertising technology. Beyond commercial applications, there is scope for social impact by opening analysis and explanatory power of controversies to individual users. Controversies have a massive impact on civic society and the so-called "filter bubble" exacerbates polarization, both political and otherwise; fake news on both sides of the political spectrum has recently captured public attention and generated political concern. Positive impact on society from commercializing this technology includes helping users become better informed and more capable of critically evaluating the often-overwhelming stream of online content. Proving the feasibility of this innovation in a highly quantifiable space such as finance could answer a customer need in that space and create new jobs for the economy, while enabling social good applications that can improve civic society.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project relies on sophisticated machine learning and information retrieval techniques to automatically detect controversial topics. The initial data were collected at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, using NSF-supported research, which recognized controversy by mapping the text of a webpage to algorithmically-identified controversial topics. Research has demonstrated that controversy cannot be detected using existing methods of sentiment analysis, a widely-adopted natural language processing method. This project bridges the gap between the current capabilities of this nascent technology and the clear user need in the financial domain. It will evaluate the feasibility of controversy detection by applying a real-time controversy detection signal to financial data to reduce risk and increase returns.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is that it will enable small and mid-size robotics and industrial vehicle manufacturers to rapidly deploy computer vision and machine learning in their products and make their machines competitive in the global market place. The project will create a multi-vendor real-time vision stack for industrial machines that enables multiple types of machines to be developed using a uniform software interface. Combined with an app store model, such interfaces will enable a developer community to create application-specific solutions with ease, add features to machines via software and essentially create a new market. When deployed by equipment manufacturers, it will have societal impact by reducing the number of forklift and other industrial and construction machine related accidents, deaths and property damage. There are secondary benefits such as reducing the amount spent on worker compensation. The scientific impact will be the enhanced understanding of principled approaches to stereoscopic depth estimation combined with machine learning based object detectors to create integrated vision systems that function in real-time on commodity hardware.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the fact that current solutions for autonomous vehicles and machines use expensive LIDARs and RADARs in conjunction with cameras. Such systems are cost-prohibitive and ill-suited for industrial applications that operate in structured warehouse and manufacturing environments rather than highways. Manufacturers can benefit from a cheaper integrated vision-based system where all the necessary algorithms, software and hardware engineering has already been done for them. The intellectual merit of the project lies in achieving the following research goals. 1) Develop an algorithmic approach to stereoscopic depth estimation that combines quick-to-generate classic features (e.g., edges and corners) with machine learning. 2) Combine machine learning based object detectors with stereoscopic depth to create an integrated vision pipeline that functions in real-time on commodity hardware. 3) Devise methods to train the system more easily by relying on depth and motion features. 4) Address critical operational design considerations such as thermal and power management and understand requirements to maintain mechanical and structural integrity through periods of intense use.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project focused on a novel seat design that reduces vehicle-based whole-body vibration and shock will 1) better protect human health while 2) addressing major transportation markets including trucking, agriculture, construction, military vehicles, and mass transit, as well as automobiles and water-/land-based recreational vehicles.  The envisioned socio-economic impact is significant:  Continual exposure to whole-body vibration and shocks can cause discomfort, reduction in work performance, and chronic low-back pain for vehicle operators and passengers.  Low-back pain is the largest component of disability among all occupational-related injuries. Though so-called "active" seats can help reduce these vibrations/shocks, their high cost is a major barrier. The low-cost seats being pursued here could benefit millions of vehicle operators. The work will also result in a greater scientific and technological understanding of the sources/effects of and potential remedies for whole-body vibration and shock. The suspension system market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 5.11%, by value, from 2016 to 2021. The market is expected to grow from USD 52.38 Billion in 2015 to USD 67.22 Billion by 2021.  The market for bus seats alone is expected to be at $10.03 Billion by the year 2022.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is focused on the feasibility of a quasi-semi-active seat (QSAS) technology.  Seating design for heavy equipment and vehicle operators has faced a trade-off between performance and cost. The most-complex 'active seats' reduce vibration but are cost-prohibitive at $3,500. Semi-active seats are simplified active seats and perform better than passive seats, but still magnify input vibration and cost several thousand dollars. Passive seats are the least expensive, but they magnify input vibration at low frequencies.  Recent design/material advances and strong preliminary data set the stage for developing an innovative passive seat at a fraction of the cost of semi-active seats that will reduce input vibration at low frequencies. Phase I feasibility will be shown using sliding friction to mitigate vibration at low frequency.  A QSAS prototype will be built and used to show potential in laboratory and field settings.  Technical challenges will involve material selection that will show maximum vibration mitigation and dissipation, as well as integration of the cushion with a suspension system that can handle the weight of a seated person. The research will determine effective performance parameters under different magnitudes and frequencies of vibration that simulate realistic operational conditions.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is reduced levelized cost of electricity (LCOE)
    of offshore wind from current levels that are about twice that of onshore wind.
    Given the proximity of offshore wind resources to load centers along the coast,
    it is an attractive renewable energy source for the nation, but high costs are
    an impediment to widespread adoption. One way to address this is with larger turbines
    that can lead to lower ?balance of plant? costs, which can be as high as 65% of
    the total project costs of offshore wind. However, turbine rating is currently
    limited due to the large size and weight of the generator and the rotor, as well
    as infrastructure obstacles like manufacturing, transport, and assembly. The lightweight
    superconducting (SC) generators being developed within this project, coupled with
    advanced rotors already being developed by the OEM?s, could open the door to significantly
    larger turbine ratings and lower costs. The underlying high specific power machine
    technology can also help transform a number of other weight-sensitive electrical
    systems like hybrid electric airplanes and ship propulsion.\n \nThis Small Business
    Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to disrupt the traditional risk
    versus benefit trade of the low Technology Readiness Level (TRL) SC technology
    by significantly increasing the benefits with a novel ?active magnetic shielding?
    concept. This design concept enables a very high operating magnetic field within
    the machine while eliminating the need for a yoke made of ferromagnetic steel
    to contain the field. The higher internal fields increase the electromagnetic
    torque significantly over other solutions, leading to very high power density.
    Additionally, the elimination of heavy iron from the magnetic circuit leads to
    further reduction in weight. The proposed generator design can be about half the
    size of currently available wind direct-drives. Efficiency is also expected to
    improve with the elimination of about a third of copper coils while maintaining
    the same current density. Available cryogenic cooling technology from the commercially
    successful magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) industry will be adapted and utilized
    in the machine to reduce many of the cryogenics related risks while maintaining
    high specific power.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been
    deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual

    in the ability to deploy drones in industrial and commercial indoor environments

    in the presence of people is to make them safe and non-threatening.  In addition,
    for drones to function as robots, they need to be made fully autonomous and minimize
    the need for human operation or intervention.  These attributes are not possible
    with conventional drone technology today.  The ability to use drones as aerial

    scanning, construction, security, and factory automation.  Such robots can enable
    functions such as scanning and reconstruction of the environment, or also ?pick
    and place? at high throughput within factories.  The use of drones in industrial
    indoor environments for these applications can also result in broader societal
    benefits, including improved worker safety inside industrial indoor environments
    (by performing tasks that may otherwise require harnesses, forklifts or ladders);
    reduced environmental impacts (in construction sites by catching discrepancies
    early and minimizing rework and material wastage) and macroeconomic benefits (enabling

    This SBIR Phase I project will address the pedagogical and evaluative problems caused by our current inability to measure core outcomes beyond information recall. The proposed innovation makes important educational outcomes such as deep understanding, cognition (thinking skills) and awareness of thinking (metacognition) measurable. Reliable assessment of these outcomes has broad significance to education and society writ large, as many employers struggle with skills gaps between high school and college graduates and the professional, personal and societal demands on adults in the 21st Century. This research combines cognitive science, epistemology, systems science, and complex systems with new developments in artificial intelligence, including machine learning and neural networks, and aligns well with the NSF's mission to promote progress in science and advance national prosperity. This project not only has the potential to impact core tenets of educational practice - including how teachers teach, how learners learn, and how we measure and understanding knowledge - but also may have impact on science through increased ability to map and analyze patterns and common structures in knowledge and generally for Americans to increase their developmental skills and abilities. Beginning in an educational market valued at $8-15 billion, this project has the potential to catalyze significant job creation and have significant commercial impact across a range of related industries.

    This SBIR Phase I project introduces a visual grammar for mapping ideas in a canvas-based environment, and provides a neural-network based mechanism for quantitatively comparing expressions of complex ideas along many dimensions to facilitate a new approach to thinking, learning, and assessment. Maps of ideas will be tokenized and serialized and then fed through a recurrent neural network model to produce encoded numeric vector representations that are meaningfully comparable in their encoded form. Once in this form, vectors will be compared and evaluated for content and structure similarity, and insights offered in many dimensions: depth of detail, understanding of relationships, and numerous other meaningful measures. These vectors enable scalable, consistent, constructive assessment in a way not previously possible. In the mapping environment, teachers and students will create maps either on their own, or collaboratively together in real-time. As users create maps, we use the generated vectors to analyze both content and structure, and then prompt users to think about their subject matter from new perspectives. As a means of evaluation, teachers will create mapping activities for students to complete, and then student maps will be quantitatively compared to the standards and target maps which represent the complete understanding of the topic.

    This SBIR Phase I project introduces a new design for antibody-based therapeutic molecules. The generally rigid arms in Y-shaped conventional antibodies are replaced with flexible and extendible linkers attached to binding domains that are smaller than those found in conventional antibodies. This new design allows multiple therapeutic targets to be bound at once, with greater binding strength and fewer off-target effects than was previously possible. This project will remake two of the most successful cancer drugs of the last decade, creating improved versions of each. In addition, a new molecule combining the functionality of both will be produced. If this project is successful, it may improve the treatments available for many kinds of advanced metastatic cancer, especially melanoma and lung cancer. Though the current focus is on cancer, the method described here may improve or combine the performance of many therapeutic antibodies; this project is just the first demonstration. The potential long-term impact of this SBIR Phase I project may extend throughout the pharmaceutical industry, representing a significant commercial opportunity and a milestone of applied biological research.

    This project introduces a novel drug design that improves on monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). It uses a chemical assembly method that joins immunoglobulin Fc domains to small, single-chain fibronectin binding domains through flexible, extendible, non-peptidyl linkers. The resulting flexible drug molecules benefit from two-handed cooperative binding, in which both domains are able to bind a disease target or targets simultaneously. They thus achieve higher binding affinity and target selectivity than mAbs, while also being smaller and easier to manufacture. These molecules can also be mono- or bispecific as needed. This project will produce flexible monospecific and bispecific molecules against the targets of the two most successful checkpoint inhibitors in current cancer immunotherapy. This project encompasses chemical synthesis, verification of binding stoichiometry, in vitro measurements of binding affinity to both purified protein and target cells, and cellular assays of both checkpoint inhibition and bispecific binding. It sets the stage for pre-clinical animal studies of these cancer drugs, and showcases a molecular design that could be used to improve most antibody therapies in the broader pharmaceutical market.

    This SBIR Phase I project aims to develop and demonstrate the feasibility of a system that can identify a broad range of bacteria in < 1 hour directly from blood. Existing diagnostic systems require 2-6 days to identify the bacteria, which delays treatment using appropriate antibiotics. Sepsis, which is often caused by a bacterial infection, contributes to up to half of all hospital deaths in the US largely due to complications arising from delays or inappropriate treatment (which is mainly because of lack of information regarding the infection-causing bacteria). It is the most expensive hospital-treated condition in the United States ? representing $20.3 billion in healthcare costs. The proposed system aims to sharply reduce the time to provide information needed by physicians, enabling them to initiate treatment using the appropriate antibiotic rapidly. This is expected to lead to significant reductions in costs, complications, and mortality. Further, by eliminating the need for culturing, new insights into bacterial behavior can be acquired contributing to additional fundamental knowledge of bacteria. This knowledge will aid antibiotic discovery efforts, improve understanding of mechanisms of drug resistance, support new biomanufacturing processes through faster detection of bacterial contamination of pharmaceutical products and foods, and characterization of the microbiome.

    The challenges of rapid bacterial identification are primarily in two areas ? sample preparation, that eliminates the need for culturing, and multiplex identification, to cover the diverse range of bacterial species capable of causing infection. The proposed work is based on leveraging the differential response between bacteria and the cells in a sample matrix to selectively break down the sample matrix, but not bacteria, such that the largest lysis debris is smaller than intact bacteria. The debris is subsequently separated from intact bacteria using a size-based technique enabling rapid isolation of a broad range of bacteria directly from the sample. A novel Fourier-transform infrared microspectroscopy system is then used to identify the isolated bacteria at clinically relevant concentrations. No bacteria-specific reagents are employed. The proposed Phase I work addresses the highest risk technical hurdles in the process. Isolating and detecting low concentration of bacteria directly from blood is accomplished through the three objectives of this project that optimize the purification and bacterial recovery from the sample, identification accuracy, and performance of the integrated system relative to the traditional culturing-based method.

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase I project develops a bacterial platform for intracellular
    drug delivery to solid tumors, with a primary focus on liver cancer. Every year,
    30,000 men and women are diagnosed with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma
    (HCC), which has a 5-year survival rate of 17.6 %. The prognosis for these patients
    is poor. Currently, there are no curative treatments for these patients. The current
    standard-of-care only increases overall survival by months and has toxic side
    effects, with a cost to the US healthcare system of $1.5B per year. This technology
    is based on the inherent feature of bacteria to colonize solid tumors throughout
    the body in ratios of 100,000 to 1 compared to healthy tissue. Due to this specificity,
    the developed bacterial platform has the potential to increase dosage specifically
    in tumors, while reducing toxic side effects in healthy tissues. This platform
    will be a toolbox that can target intracellular pathways that are currently considered
    undruggable and deliver potent doses of biologicals directly into tumor cells.
    The affinity of bacteria for solid tumors, independent of organ localization,
    enables the extension of this delivery method to other hard-to-treat tumor types,
    such as pancreas, ovarian and gastric cancer. \n\nSystemic cancer therapies have
    many obstacles, such as stability in the blood, traversing the cellular membrane,
    internalization and endosomal release. These processes impede the use of RNAi
    and peptides in humans and hamper the targeting of intracellular pathways with
    monoclonal antibodies. The development of a bacterial drug delivery platform can
    optimize drug potency in tumors and reduce side effects in healthy tissue. In
    this SBIR phase I, efficacy of this platform will be measured in HCC by targeting
    intracellular pathways essential for cell survival, for which no systemic therapy
    exists. A bacterial strain will be created according to FDA guidelines that can
    be manufactured reliably without loss of activity. An optimized preservation protocol
    will be developed to ensure maximal bacterial fitness and maximal delivery efficacy
    after administration. This bacterial delivery system has the potential to accelerate
    the translation of fundamental cancer research into clinical therapies. Discoveries
    could be genetically translated directly into protein, antibody or shRNA therapies
    that regulate mammalian gene expression and function.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the ability to address secure communications with virtually no overhead at reasonable cost.  The asynchronous engine developed in this program will enable robust encryption and decryption while offering improvements in power efficiency, data throughput and security.  According to SDM, the market for encryption and decryption technology could be as high as $38.5 billion by 2020.  Additionally, there is a recognized need for encryption and authentication of power and chemical/process plants in the U.S., currently dangerously underserved.  The initial market is estimated to be $270M and the serviceable addressable market is $2.7B.  This program's primary focus will be on the asynchronous engine for the industrial and data center industries with a total market of $27B.  In addition, the proposed technology will be flexible enough to be incorporated into encryption-decryption products in many other industries.  These include consumer goods and services, such as mobile communications devices, entertainment and transportation (vehicles, airplanes).

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will address the need for cyber security for Internet-of-Things (loT) systems using an innovative approach: an asynchronous engine using chaotic functions to generate an infinite length key for encryption and decryption.   During the past few decades, information has emerged as the most valuable asset for both individuals and corporations.  Cyber-attacks no longer exclusively target military or large enterprises; everyone from private citizens to businesses to governments requires secure communications.  The methods of encryption rely on digital schemes to encrypt and decrypt messages using general-purpose CPUs and software; which means that loT devices impend hacking of information, system function, corporate profits, and national security.  Our unique approach will include a discrete-logic program with reconfigurable chaotic oscillators loaded into a field programmable gate array (FPGA).  This hybrid system will be tested with different loT devices and network configurations.  The long-term goal of the hybrid encryption-decryption engine is to build a hardware encryption device to secure peer-to-peer communication.  The innovative solution will allow the attached device to execute much faster than current solutions of similar complexity while reducing or eliminating overhead, and allowing one-time pad encryption.

    probe by means of sensitive electrochemical events occurring at the conductive
    gold microchip surface. For the development of this new sensing microchip device
    the team will use commercially available products. Silicon wafers have been used
    as substrate with gold as electrodes due to their reliability but these materials
    are expensive and the fabrication is labor intensive. Therefore, important diagnostic
    device parameters will be studied after incorporation of bare bio-sensing strips.
    Phase I of this project, is aimed at demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed

Around the world, there are varying degrees of fraud and it is well known that poorer countries have higher levels of fraud then more advanced countries. By providing a trustable biometric device, the proposed commercialization plan will allow lower levels of fraud and allow greater degree of economic activity bringing up standards of living. The technology of GHz ultrasonics for sensing also has the potential for to be used for applications in being able to image baby fingerprints, enable fingerprint readers in fire-arms for authenticated use at very fast speeds, and allow integration with credit and debit cards. The success of the commercial activities will create a new paradigm for trusting the electronic economy.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop revolutionary new biometric sensors. Biometric technologies range from sensing the unique patterns of the eyes, to voice, and fingerprints amongst other markers. Capacitive fingerprint sensors, and optical fingerprint sensors are very commonly found in smartphones and desktop applications. These technologies produce images that are often limited in resolution and are not spoof-proof. For example, optical fingerprint readers can be spoofed by fingerprint images and capacitive fingerprint sensors can be spoofed by skin-like dielectric polymer fingerprint molds. Ultrasonic images offer the potential for detecting tissue material properties that can help identify fake fingerprints. Although many low-frequency technologies for ultrasonic fingerprint sensing are available, very few have made it into the market in large quantities owing to cost, packaging, and insufficient SNR and resolution. In this project the company will extend the frequency of operation to the GHz range to achieve four to eight times the standard industry standard of 500 dpi resolution. Coupled with integrated circuits operating at low voltages, the company aims for integration of the sensors in very thin platforms such as credit cards.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop and bring to market tools that improve code quality and help avoid dangerous bugs, while also improving programmer productivity. Poor code quality leads to bugs which often translate into financial loses and can even endanger human life. A study by NIST estimated software bugs cost $59 billion annually. The key aspect of this project is a programmer-friendly language for describing software fixes. Successful adoption of the language by the programmer community can have a far-reaching positive impact upon the software community: programmers will have a common, formal, language to discuss ways to fix bugs, and the result of their collaboration could be used to automatically fix software systems.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will address the research and technical challenges in providing programmers with a language to express their knowledge of error patterns and their fixes, and a tool that uses this information to check and fix software systems. The research objective is to refine the language such that it is easy to use by programmers, and to provide a scalable infrastructure. This will be achieved by iteratively improving both the language and the supporting infrastructure with feedback from early users. The anticipated result is that the technology will be applicable to a wide variety of bugs and to large code bases.

    Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will result from a direct benefit to the energy
    sector of the U.S. economy, since seismic exploration will play an increasingly
    important role in meeting increasing energy demands and maintaining healthy oil
    and gas output. The goal of this project is to develop a software package for
    automated pattern recognition that can be used by seismic processing companies
    to automatically pick geological features from seismic data. Seismic data volumes
    have grown exponentially over the last three decades as the seismic exploration
    industry increases its survey coverage. Manual picking and geological pattern
    identification jobs, which depend on visual inspection, are labor intensive and
    cannot keep up with the growth in data generated by seismic surveys. In this project,
    the company will develop a machine vision enabled picking and identification tool
    trained by a deep learning network. Lessons learned in training an efficient deep
    learning network for pattern recognition have wide applications in other areas
    such as medical image analysis. This project will support the training of both
    graduate and undergraduate students in the areas of seismic exploration, machine
    learning and high-performance computing. \n\nThis Small Business Technology Transfer
    (STTR) Phase I project aims to develop a deep learning network model to recognize
    unique patterns embedded in seismic data, which patterns are characteristic of
    the associated geological structures. Specifically, the project will demonstrate
    the feasibility of delivering a machine vision enabled inspection tool to relieve
    domain experts from labor-intensive visual examination activities. Various automatic
    picking approaches currently exist, with differing degrees of success. Nonetheless,
    the uncertainty involved in these tools is still too high for them to be widely
    adopted by the industry. Recent advances in the area of deep learning make it
    possible to surpass human-level visual recognition performance in some applications.
    High performance deep learning network models, however, require a large amount
    of high quality training data. In this project, the company proposes to use a
    novel self-taught deep transfer learning approach to overcome the data shortage
    problem resulting from proprietary rights associated with the data. The new training
    workflow is adaptive to the domain of seismic data processing. It will also minimize
    the training effort and deliver a robust system with guaranteed performance for
    new and unseen datasets."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the restoration of trust in computing systems.  Successful cyberattacks, including mass privacy breaches and the discovery of device backdoors, have shaken trust in computing, put users at risk, hurt the economy, and even threatened our national security.  The usual set of ad-hoc, incomplete, and costly approaches simply have not addressed the problem.  This research effort will advance a viable, practical, and holistic solution that gives users much stronger guarantees of security while lowering the costs of keeping systems secure.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop TigerGuard, a computer system security architecture that contains the effects of cyberattacks on existing computer infrastructure.  TrustGuard is based on a small, separately manufactured, and easy-to-verify hardware element, called the Sentry, that serves as the root of trust.  The Sentry is a general-purpose hardware trust component that, when combined with an application-specific Dynamic Specification Check (DSC) software component, provides flexible containment capabilities.  The containment guarantees of TigerGuard hold despite design and manufacturing flaws (known and not-yet-known, malicious and unintentional) in the operating system, firmware, hardware, and software, including those in the application software itself. Formal verification of both the Sentry and DSC, a practical effort given their total size of only a few thousand lines of code, becomes equivalent in security guarantees to proving hundreds of millions of existing lines of code correct (including the processor design, memory implementation, hard drive firmware, the operating system, shared libraries, and the application code).

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to enhance the capabilities of a research
    tool for companies, legal experts and researchers undertaking nationwide comparative
    policy analysis in the public health domain. The tool will assist experts in identifying
    relevant policy documents by determining and scoring the significance of statutory
    provisions in context of specific legal questions. The quantitative approach can
    enable novel policy tracking. Rather than experts setting up alerts for updates
    to a specific set of documents, this tool learns from the legal text used to answer
    legal questions to allow for real time tracking and discovery of updates and other
    relevant documents. This approach to policy tracking can present experts with
    timely information on updates, along with revealing new documents as they are
    introduced.  Timely analysis can inform policy-makers, facilitating the crafting
    of optimized evidence-based public health legislation.  Reducing the cost and
    effort of the most time-consuming aspects of legal research can make precise scientific
    policy analysis affordable and accessible commercially and in real time. \n\nThis
    Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will decrease the time
    required to produce timely analysis of public health policy across 50 states.
    This research will apply machine learning, natural language processing and graph
    theory techniques to extract logical legal ontologies by computing similarities
    of public health provisions in statutory text. In domain specific problems, large
    sets of examples of annotated text are required. In the legal domain there is
    little available expert-labeled legal corpora and purposefully curating this kind
    of dataset is prohibitively expensive.  To address this challenge, the proposed
    solution integrates transparently into legal experts' workflow while generating
    ontology that mirrors the approach of a domain expert. The second challenge is
    that searching for patterns in the relations of a very large network of documents
    can be very expensive computationally. The proposed solution addresses this by
    extracting clues from the expert workflow to identify shortcuts that simplify
    and constrain the larger problem. These clues, combined with sparse expert labeled
    data can produce a more accurate baseline for optimization of scoring and similarity
    comparison of larger sets. By being integrated into more workflows, the transparent
    annotation process and algorithm could be applied to other policy domains."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to spark more cybersecurity innovations, by reducing the R&D expenditures via providing fundamental security analytics tools as a service. Global cybersecurity spending is increasing significantly year over year. Enormous R&D resources have been invested in the development of a range of security products to meet this market. However, different security product providers repeatedly build the fundamental security analytics tools and use them to further develop different innovative security solutions. That is a huge waste of R&D resources.  The proposed solution reduces the R&D expenditure of customers and lowers the entry bar for the growing cybersecurity market. With the lowered entry bar, the company anticipates that more innovations will be put into practice. As a result, with the increased competition and reduced R&D expenditure, the company expects a reduction in cybersecurity spending by companies and the government.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on malware intelligence, which has been a long-standing as well as increasingly complex cybersecurity problem. Traditional signature based detection and manual reverse engineering approaches can no longer keep up with the pace of increasingly sophisticated obfuscation and attack techniques. The objective of this project is to develop a security analysis tool for malware intelligence by combining the following two unique techniques: "whole-system emulation based dynamic binary analysis" and "deep-learning based binary code similarity detection". The first technique provides a fine-grained monitor capability to observe the behaviors of malware. The second technique provides the capability of learning and characterizing complex features. By combining these two techniques, the proposed technology will be able to better understand malware and generate actionable intelligence.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to dramatically improve the human productivity in gathering insights from data, and to democratize data analytics by making it available to a broad class of users within an enterprise. With DataChat, complex analyses can be carried out by simply conversing with a trained chatbot. The proposed approach has the potential to open a new vertical in the analytics market in which chatbots aid humans in carrying out the task of creating, deploying and running complex data science pipelines. This project could lead to the creation of a sub-market in the existing analytic software market, and it could also help improve the productivity of the (non-technology) sectors of the economy that increasingly require high-quality and fast insights from both their archival and real-time datasets.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will take on a number of technical challenges including designing and developing a method to allow programming the underlying program that powers chatbots. Another technical challenge that will be tackled is making it easy to load external data that may not have well-defined schemas. A type inferencing mechanism, and associated set of methods to learn over historical data, will be developed to address this research aspect. Another technical challenge is building good machine learning models, for which a set of mechanisms is proposed that will allow automatic exploration and ranking of machine learning models, aiding the user in picking the right model for the specific task at hand. Overall these technical components will collectively contribute to the different facets of data analysis that are needed to gather insights from data, and will power the overall chatbot approach.

    This SBIR Phase I project is focused on modeling, designing, analyzing, building and testing a prototype commercial superinsulation called High Performance Multi-Layer Insulation (HPMLI). HPMLI is based on a new technology that significantly reduces heat leak, and allows a multilayer insulation to be used in commercial applications. HPMLI could provide R-235 thermal insulation, compared to current state of the art R-6 foam insulation, offering 40-fold lower heat leak into fridges and freezers and reducing energy use. Heating and cooling account for 74% of U.S. residential energy use, with water heaters and refrigerators consuming 26% and $60B in annual costs. This superinsulation, originally developed for NASA and used for spaceflight, could save 90% of energy used for refrigeration and heating appliances, reducing energy costs and protecting our environment. This opportunity is to develop and manufacture a novel ultra-high-performance insulation for use by appliance manufacturers and consumers for improved energy efficiency, and will enable the small business to grow to 17 employees, with $20M in revenue by 2022. This insulation has many potential applications, including home refrigerators, commercial freezers, water heaters, refrigerated trucks and shipping containers, industrial hot/cold processes, food coolers and buildings.


    HPMLI is based on novel discrete spacers and radiation barrier layers, forming a new very high- performance insulation. A novel system is proposed in which the spacers self- support the layers against external atmospheric pressure, allowing use in air. Technical challenges must be solved that carefully balance structural support, heat flux, cost and ease of integration into appliances. This insulation is only possible due to the unique properties of the discrete spacers, which must be designed, developed and tested for this application. The goals are to successfully build and test a prototype demonstrating greater than R-200 thermal performance, and able to be vacuum sealed into vacuum panels or appliance case walls. The system will be thermally modeled for several concepts, a spacer design iterated, prototype demonstration units built for a fridge and/or food cooler, and the heat flux through the insulation measured. HPMLI will be compared to current state of the art foam, and factors required for commercialization considered in this Phase I design.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I Project will develop a metal-free route to the production of high performance plastics and composites. Specifically, this project focuses on a unique class of materials based upon a thermoset that displays high strength-to-weight ratio and exceptional fracture toughness. A challenge to broader adoption of these materials stems from the current reliance on metal-based reagents and catalysts for their production. The metals impose a significant recurring cost of production, show sensitivity to air, and remain as contaminants in the final products. This innovation provides the first metal-free access to such materials. Additionally, the unique metal-free catalyst system is capable of producing resin and polymer feedstocks that are not available from metal-based reagents, and may offer advantages in processing and performance. The projected commercial impacts of the innovation will be enhanced material performance, lower cost products, and broadened (new) fields of use. The existing market is estimated to be $578M with 4.9% annual growth through 2023.

    The intellectual merit of this project is the invention and development of the first metal-free route to olefin metathesis polymers and oligomers. Prior art has demonstrated on small scale the ability to use a unique organocatalyst to produce polymer and resin feedstocks that are easily processable into high performance thermosets and composites. The organocatalyst approach is a divergence from all previous methods of producing materials via olefin metathesis and therefore warrants validation and optimization toward commercial scale-up. The Phase I research aims will include (1) scale-up through the design and implementation of flow reactor technologies, (2) mechanical analyses and product specification sheets for thermoset prototypes, and (3) evaluation of new resins and polymers for use in fiber reinforced composite materials.  The results should be useful commercially and academically.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of an intuitive, easy-to-use, Smart Respiratory Health Management System for respiratory patients and their physicians. This system includes (1) lab-quality lung function data produced by the proposed mobile spirometer and paired smartphone application, (2) the interpretation and contextualization of this lung function data based on local environmental and physiological risk factors, and (3) the delivery of these insights to physicians and patients. By leveraging this software platform, this technology is expected to enable physicians to make timely interventions with their at-risk patients, thereby preventing acute respiratory exacerbations (e.g., asthma attacks) and any associated hospitalizations or visits to the emergency department. Currently, respiratory diseases are poorly managed, and the proposed predictive technology can help reduce the 1.6 million annual asthma-related visits to the emergency department. By enabling preventative patient interventions, the proposed technology is expected to reduce the high cost of asthma-related emergency department visits and hospitalizations. The proposed system-level solution will empower asthma patients to participate in their own health and treatment, while simultaneously improving health-related behaviors, patient-physician communication, and preventative care coordination.

    The proposed project focuses on the development of a software platform that connects chronic respiratory disease patients to physicians, to alert physicians of declining lung health. With this preemptive alert, physicians can intervene with patients before an acute respiratory exacerbation, thereby reducing hospitalizations and their associated costs. There are three steps required to implement this proposed system. The first is to facilitate the affordable collection of daily lab-quality lung function data. This step has already been completed via a mobile spirometer and pair smartphone application. The second step is to interpret and contextualize the collected data. This step requires the development of a predictive algorithm that incorporates risk factors from a  physical activity and local environment. The third step is to deliver this data and their interpretation to the physician in a manner that is seamlessly incorporated into the existing electronic health records infrastructure and the physician's workflow. The second and third steps will be undertaken as part of this Phase I grant.

    This STTR Phase I project will remove the most critical roadblock to making long-lasting batteries from safe and economical zinc and air. Zinc is plentiful in the U.S. and zinc-air batteries have the potential to hold more than five times the energy of current lithium-ion batteries, but a key challenge for making rechargeable zinc-air batteries is that the zinc inside the battery naturally forms sharp needles called dendrites during recharging. Over time these dendrites can grow large enough to damage the inner workings of the battery, reducing efficiency and lifetime. This project will borrow principles from an adjacent field, the electroplating industry, to create new organic chemicals that will seek out and stop dendrite growth within the battery during recharging. Chemical additives have a long history in electroplating for controlling the shape of metal surfaces, and the same principles can apply to additives designed here to control zinc growth during battery recharging. This new technology will make zinc-air batteries cheaper and longer-lasting to eventually replace existing battery technologies, enabling longer-distance electric vehicles, reducing equipment weight for soldiers, contributing a valuable technology to the economy, and helping to maintain the role of the U.S. as a leader in energy storage technology.



    This STTR Phase I project will identify the critical chemistry necessary to elegantly and economically suppress zinc dendrite formation, alleviating one of the most significant challenges complicating the full commercial emergence of Zn-Air battery technology. Eschewing the established tactic of applying existing chemicals from the catalog, this project will take inspiration from the PI?s experience designing additives for similar environments in the electroplating industry to introduce novel proprietary organic chemistry addressing the dendrite bottleneck directly. The key technical challenge will be to optimize the molecular features to simultaneously provide efficient dendrite suppression and low voltage loss. A broad series of molecules will be created to combine strong interactions with zinc, modest polarization, low cost and straightforward scalability. Evaluating and iterating upon these candidates in bench-scale electrochemical analyses and performance tests in coin and pouch cell batteries will yield a dendrite-suppressing product to bring significant value to Zn-Air technology and other Zn-based battery markets. At its successful conclusion, this project will not only produce products for these markets, but it will also provide molecular design principles useful for the development of other metal-based battery additives, and promote the merits of novel additive development for the broader battery industry.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) project is the development a scalable, automated, genetic transformation
    platform that is 10,000X faster than the current state-of-the-art.  The fields
    of synthetic biology and genetic engineering are currently limited by the ability
    to re-program microorganisms with foreign DNA. There have been significant advances
    in the synthesis of DNA, screening of genetically engineered microorganisms, and
    bioinformatics. However, the technology used to deliver DNA and perform genetic
    transformation has not advanced in a similar way. Phase I of this SBIR will result
    in a prototype high-throughput genetic transformation platform to demonstrate
    the utility of the system. This system will allow genetic engineers to more rapidly
    develop microorganisms for the production of bioengineered chemicals and materials.
    \n\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a high-throughput, automated
    platform for genetic transformation of bacteria using a proprietary flow-through
    electroporation technology that is fast, reliable, and scalable. A key step in
    genetic engineering of cells is to introduce the foreign DNA that re-programs
    the cell. Electroporation, cell permeabilization using pulsed electric fields,
    is the most efficient and widespread method to deliver DNA into microorganisms
    for this application. State-of-the-art electroporation involves cuvettes that
    expose the cells and DNA to uniform electric fields. However, this process is
    currently slow, labor-intensive, and expensive. The proposed technology can be
    automated by augmenting existing liquid handling robots, and, when operated in
    parallel, may improve the genetic transformation rate by up to 10,000X compared
    to current methods. This will represent a paradigm shift in areas dependent upon
    genetic transformation where DNA delivery using electroporation is currently a
    major bottleneck. Ultimately, the goal is to address the need for a high-throughput
    genetic transformation platform to accelerate innovation in synthetic biology."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the need for non-invasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and hands-free control of technologies, including artificial and virtual reality (AR/VR) and smart devices. The proposed multi-purposed BCI is expected to have immediate applications for several industries, including manufacturing and medicine. Currently, existing systems are either too expensive or limited for real-time control. The proposed BCI is specifically designed for 3 dimensional environments, and is intended to leverage multiple ('hybrid') signals from the human body to allow increased performance using affordable hardware. It is also designed for and expected to allow AR/VR control, which can enable productivity applications, as well as model BCI use in real-world scenarios. The long term goal is to enable users to scroll menus, select objects, and even type using their brain activity. The platform uses the existing form-factor of AR/VR headsets to incorporate brain-sensing electrodes, and will be compatible with popular devices, independently or in parallel with their existing controllers. The electrodes are designed to be safe, non-invasive, and dry (requiring conductive gel or saline). The high-risk, high-reward research to be conducted under this project will significantly advance the applications of BCI systems in general, with an emphasis on AR/VR technologies.

    The proposed project concerns a novel hybrid BCI by combining oculomotor and electroencephalography (EEG) signals via a custom machine learning platform. BCIs detect and interpret neural signals enabling control over a variety of technologies. However, current BCIs remain extremely limited in their applicability. They either require expensive equipment, invasive surgery, or have too low performance when using affordable noninvasive hardware. This BCI aims to provide real-time control in 3-dimensional scenarios, (e.g., AR/VR/real-world smart devices), while using affordable hardware. This SBIR Phase I project seeks to combine three distinct innovations: high-performance EEG signal analysis, high-speed eye movement classification, and custom multi-signal ensemble classification techniques. Specifically, the project seeks to use a custom machine learning and artificial intelligence approach informed by physiology to combine oculomotor and EEG signals to specifically enable3D AR/VR control. The ultimate goal is to develop a high performance BCI system that affords flexible user control across hardware, software, and mobile applications.

    This SBIR Phase I project aims to develop a novel blood diagnostic to detect unruptured intracranial aneurysms (IA) in asymptomatic patients. About 2-5% of the U.S. population (about 6-17 million Americans) have an unruptured IA, and these individuals are largely asymptomatic and thus unaware of the potential danger they are in. Currently, no good screening tools to identify patients with unruptured IAs exist. As a result, about 30,000 Americans suffer IA rupture each year without warning, 10-15% of whom die on the way to the hospital and another 30-40% of whom die within a month. The diagnostic screening technology developed in this project will identify people who have unruptured IAs, thus enabling patients to be monitored and receive preventative treatment, which can drastically reduce the rate of rupture. In addition to the health benefits of this non-invasive test, it will also result in massive savings for the healthcare system. The estimated lifetime healthcare costs for annual cases of patients with ruptured IA is about $3 billion, and more than $885 million for patients with unruptured IAs. Plus, the annual lost wages of surviving ruptured IA patients and their caretakers combined is an estimated $138 million.

    This project aims to develop a molecular diagnostic to detect biomarkers of unruptured aneurysms using the transcriptomes of circulating neutrophils. Preliminary results have shown that circulating neutrophils isolated from blood samples could be used to predict unruptured IA presence with 80% accuracy. This Phase I project will increase the sample size of the previous discovery and validation cohorts to give more confidence in the discovered biomarkers as well as increase the accuracy of the proposed diagnostic. Transcriptomes of neutrophil RNA from patients with and without aneurysms will be obtained through next-generation sequencing. The transcriptome data will be used to further develop biomarker models by employing a machine learning pipeline that uses supervised learning combined with 10-fold cross-validation to prevent over-fitting. The created biomarker models will be validated using neutrophil RNA expression from an independent cohort of patients. Predictive accuracy of 90% with an AUC greater than 0.80 will be used to measure success. Furthermore, to established feasibility of assessing the biomarkers via an inexpensive test, differential expression of biomarker genes will be tested using RT-qPCR, a cheaper, more facile technique than RNA sequencing.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to develop technology that will substantially reduce the cost and complexity of ribonucleic acid (RNA)-based medical testing.  Isolation of RNA from biological samples is the first and often the most difficult step in RNA diagnostic testing. All living things from bacteria to humans are threatened by viral infection and have strong natural defenses; these protein defenses are beneficial to humans but interfere with RNA testing. DNA contamination also interferes with RNA testing. As a result, there is a $2.3B market for reagents to clean-up protein and DNA contamination in RNA samples. The proposed product selectively isolates RNA from samples with near perfect selectivity, eliminating the need for these expensive RNA clean-up reagents. Simplification of the RNA isolation step has the broader impact of allowing for smaller and easier to operate devices that can be deployed to local clinics, allowing for easier and faster testing in point-of-care and rural settings.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a new carbon-based coating for magnetic beads that selectively isolates RNA from samples with better yield than current products and without DNA or protein contamination. The company has developed a preliminary technology that performs better than competing products when used to isolate RNA from cultured cells.  During this Phase I project, the material properties and usage protocols will be optimized to maximize performance in real-world applications, such as isolation of RNA from blood.  The material properties as they relate to performance in this application will be studied using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and optimized to maximize selectivity for RNA over contaminating molecules such as DNA and proteins. RNA will be isolated from diverse biological substances such as soft tissue, blood, and cell cultures, and each step in the process will be optimized to maximize yield and RNA integrity (RIN) while maintaining perfect purity as determined by northern blot, fluorescence spectroscopy, and qRT-PCR. The company also will begin to explore a manufacturing system for commercial production of the material.

    This SBIR Phase I project will develop a new approach for Additive Manufacturing (AM) of objects made from ceramics, metals, and polymers. Developed a generation ago, AM had the potential to transform the design and manufacture of products. However, legacy AM approaches have failed primarily because of the high cost of inputs, and because output lacks precision, quality and durability. Our proposed approach has broad industry potential. The broader societal impact is to change the entire competitive stance of US manufacturing by revolutionizing industrial design and enhancing local manufacturing. This project has the potential to advance science and the prosperity of US manufacturing industries. Its commercial impact may span industries from product design to aerospace, space, defense, and human health.

    This SBIR Phase I project will demonstrate the integrated production of objects made from ceramics, metals, and polymers additively at room temperature from stock inputs such as rods and discs. Over 95% of metallic AM output today uses metallic powders as inputs. These inputs are costly, explosive, and harmful to human health if ingested. Furthermore, current AM output suffers from imprecision, poor quality, inconsistency, and lack of durability. Additionally, legacy Metallic AM platforms are large, expensive, operate at high temperatures, and are isolated from the engineers who rely on them. The key objectives of this project are (1) to demonstrate the feasibility of a room-temperature fabrication approach and (2) to achieve several crucial milestones involving the precision of location, thickness, strength, uniformity and reliability of AM output.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will be the development of a fermentation-based technology that enables the renewable and sustainable production of medium-chain fatty acids - an important class of widely used industrial chemicals - using glycerol-rich waste streams as feedstocks. These chemical products constitute a growing multi-billion dollar market with applications in the flavoring, fragrances, personal care, plastics, textile, and pharmaceutical industries. This technology also will create new high-value uses for existing glycerol-rich waste streams generated within the bio-diesel industry, which can greatly improve the economic competitiveness of bio-diesel with fossil diesel, especially in an era of low oil prices. Thus, commercialization of this fermentation-based technology will serve as a foundation for developing additional eco-friendly technologies for the production of other industrial chemicals that contribute to the ~$800 billion/year petrochemical industry, in turn creating new jobs for helping the environment, benefiting society, and building a sustainable future. In addition, this SBIR project will establish a carbon conservation technology as the basis for developing the next-generation of fermentation-based chemical production technologies.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a unique carbon conserving (C2) platform technology to enable the cost-competitive and sustainable production of a variety of fatty chemicals from renewable feedstocks such as crude glycerol. The C2 platform technology comprises a series of non-natural biosynthetic pathways that minimize/eliminate carbon loss as CO2 during production, thereby improving theoretical yields over the state of the art by as much as 50%. The improved achievable yields along with the anaerobic production processes enabled by the C2 technology are two crucial features for establishing bioprocesses with cost-competitive economics relative to incumbent technologies, which is critical for commercial success. One goal of this Phase I project will be to demonstrate the production of a high-value fatty acid, hexanoic acid, from crude glycerol and using the C2 technology. For the second goal, enzyme screening, strain development, and metabolic engineering approaches will be implemented for improving hexanoic acid production metrics (i.e., higher titers, rates, and yields) from crude glycerol. Accomplishing these goals will substantially de-risk the C2 technology and establish its commercial potential for the cost-advantaged production of hexanoic acid at the commercial level.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a material which when added to commercial paint and coatings can improve indoor air quality by actively removing and degrading Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs). Indoor air quality is generally five times worse than outdoor air quality and VOCs are prevalent in indoor environments, being emitted from typical household items like electronics, cleaners, and flooring. People spend 90% of their lives in indoor environments, making poor indoor air quality a more acute health risk. VOCs are known to cause and worsen allergic diseases such as asthma and eczema, which combined, costs the United States approximately $56 billion in medical spending and lost work productivity every year. Alleviating the discomfort and financial burdens posed by allergic diseases can improve the standard of living of over 60 million affected Americans in the United States. Low- and zero-VOC paints ($9 billion market) are the fastest growing segment of architectural paints ($62 billion market). This technology has the potential to dramatically improve indoor air quality and make everyday living better for children, the elderly, and adults suffering from allergic diseases.

    The intellectual merit of this project will further the understanding of using diatoms in conjunction with a photocatalyst to harvest light as an energy source for the removal of pollutants from environments. Diatoms have been shown to increase the collection of ultraviolet, blue and red wavelengths of light. As a substrate for photocatalysts which utilize these wavelengths, diatoms may provide a superior light collection capability, increasing the effectiveness of photocatalysts. The proposed aim is to show an increase in the photocatalytic rate of VOC degradation which could help to make metal oxide photocatalysis a more viable option for air treatment. The proposed research makes the following contributions: 1) advancement of efficient visible light photocatalysis with a diatom-based additive; 2) understanding integration of photocatalytic paint additives into base paint and coatings mixtures, optimized for minimal paint substrate degradation and maximal photocatalytic degradation of indoor air-pollutants; and 3) long-term improvement of indoor air quality. Overall it is expected that this Phase I will show diatoms, as substrates, can increase the rate of photocatalysts up to two times under typical irradiation sources. This project targets cleaner indoor environments through pollutant removal activity without increased energy usage.

    will inhibit corrosion by multiple mechanisms. The nanocapsules themselves will
    prevent corrosion by acting as ionic barrier between metal and toxic ions as well
    as by anodic passivation. If the passivation or the barrier effect fails due to
    scratch or mechanical damage and the metal starts to corrode, the change in electrochemical
    potential on the corroding metal surface will activate the nanocapsules to release
    corrosion inhibitors encapsulated in the capsules at the corroding site. This

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the innovation of diamond technologies that will enhance the efficiency and reliability of electric vehicles, thus supporting the development of green technology and reduction of CO2 emissions. Specifically, diamond diodes will reduce powertrain losses by about a third and thus directly translate into a 10% increase in electric power vehicle (EPV) range. While the impact of diamond diodes is significant, the development of this technology is also intended to advance diamond power devices. Additional diamond components - such as insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) - will increase the efficiency and reliability of electric vehicles even further. Moreover, the successful commercialization of diamond will ultimately affect many power markets in addition to EPVs: including converters and inverters in geothermal drilling, aerospace, and power grids; high-frequency applications such as radar and communication systems; and extreme environment electronics relevant to the nuclear industry and space exploration, such as the exploration of Venus.

    The proposed project expects the fabrication of diamond freewheeling Schottky-PIN diodes for EPVs. These devices will utilize lab-grown diamond to produce and test PIN diodes. While growth techniques have recently been developed to enable to the fabrication of such structures, much innovation is still needed to facilitate scalability and commercialization of diamond devices. Therefore, in Phase I, the scope of research will consist of the following activities to make diamond diodes for powertrain converters and inverters in EPVs: (a) demonstrate the expected performance of diamond freewheeling diodes using simulations, (b) control the doping concentrations and thickness of single-crystal diamond layers, (c) develop scalable fabrication and patterning processes for diamond devices, (e) determine electrical characteristics of diamond PIN diodes, and (f) investigate the reliability and possible failure mechanisms of packaged diamond PIN diodes. A significant challenge for diamond devices for power applications will be the achievement of cost parity. Considering the relatively high cost of diamond substrates, an innovative commercialization strategy will be adapted to keep initial costs low, allowing diamond devices to achieve cost parity faster.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to prevent over $50 billion in wasted building utility costs annually across the US by increasing domestic shower efficiency.  Commercial adoption of this technology at scale will save 200 billion gallons of water and at least 1 trillion kWh of energy in the U.S. every year.  Reducing waste water and energy use decreases the strain on municipal water and energy infrastructure.  Lower energy use will also have a significant impact on carbon emissions associated with electric generation.  The innovation will enhance scientific and technological understanding by developing a highly-accurate novel sensing technology that works in hot and humid conditions.  Moreover, the occupancy detection technology can be used for other applications where difficult ambient conditions prevent the use of conventional sensors.  The IoT device will generate valuable end-user utility use behavior data which public institutions and private industry will use to design better policies and best practices.  In addition to the economic, technological and environmental benefits, this research also promotes jobs by providing enough utility savings to commercial buildings for them to increase their staff.

    The proposed project will eliminate behavioral water waste which occurs when a bather leaves a shower unoccupied even after the water has warmed-up.  Developing the technology requires: (1) a device that can accurately sense shower occupancy, (2) a compact enclosure resilient to a shower?s hot and humid environment and, (3) low energy circuitry and algorithms for long battery life.  Methods to achieve the project objectives include acoustic signal analysis for sensor accuracy, in-situ pilot testing, CAD design and prototyping to achieve device size constraints, and accelerated aging tests to ensure reliability and durability.  The overarching goal of this phase I feasibility effort is to validate the novel utility savings methodology, occupancy sensor accuracy and calibration over at least 5 years, and a device battery life of at least 2 years.  This project will be deemed successful if the following key technical objectives are met: (1) The sensor performs within at least a 1% error margin after relevant nondestructive, accelerated aging tests, (2) The amount of water and energy saved is at least 20% when compared to baseline during live hotel pilot tests, and (3) The device?s battery life is at least 2 years.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is that it makes high-dimensional data visualization
    more accessible to mainstream users. An interactive multivariate visualization
    framework will assist users in the understanding of complex phenomena and help
    with decision making in the presence of multiple factors. It uses a map-like layout
    of factors and data that naturally appeals to a mainstream user's innate visual
    literacy, making it easy to learn and use. Through a variety of interaction facilities,
    users can define areas in this layout that indicate parameter values of their
    interest. This then enables them to make informed decisions within a single visual
    interface and balance among the diverse impacts the various factors have on the
    decisions. Given the massive growth in the availability of multivariate data,
    the unique capabilities that the proposed framework provides are expected to have
    a strong impact on society, in many application domains and at many different
    levels - personal, business, finance, scientific, medicine, and so on. In short,
    this project will have a significant societal impact by allowing users to make
    better decisions in less time. \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
    Phase I project makes several intellectual and scientific contributions. A core
    contribution is the ability to embed high dimensional points and factors into
    a 2D plane or map, such that the distance between points has contextual meaning.
    This allows a single visualization to convey what currently takes a dashboard
    of several bivariate plots to show. The inherent mechanisms that create the combined
    map-like layout of data and factors are novel and open new opportunities to understand
    multivariate data. The same is true for the interactions defined on the layout,
    in particular those that allow users to derive the areas of influence of the various
    factors. Another intellectual contribution is the interface that allows users
    to focus their attention on specific attributes and deals with the mental and
    cognitive overload that may arise in users in the presence of too many factors
    and attributes. The proposed system constructs a meaningful hierarchical representation
    of the attributes that can be navigated within a novel space efficient visual
    interface. Using our design tools, anyone with an internet connection and a modern
    web browser will be able to create these layouts from multivariate data."

    of a new type of implantable medical device for cartilage repair in the knee.
    The implant is based on a novel material that is cartilage-like, as well 3D printed
    designs. Currently, cartilage damage in the knee is most effectively treated by
    a metallic joint replacement. However, qualifying patient age is 55 or older.
    There are several implants available to a younger and more active patient population,
    but they all suffer from major limitations such as low success rate, the size
    of the damage they treat, long recovery time or high cost. This project will mature
    an implantable device that can support weight and encouraging new bone and cartilage
    formation. The device is also made from a high performance yet low cost material,
    and 3D printing can create custom made and made to order devices that increase
    efficiency and further reduce cost. A low-cost device which can decrease recovery
    time and increase clinical success would greatly improve treatment of young patients,
    and prevent more advanced joint disease.  The project supports the NSF?s mission
    by increasing knowledge surrounding the manufacturing and clinical use of biologically
    significant materials for orthopedics. \n\nThis project will develop an ?on demand?
    device to adequately fill and support a critical-sized cartilage defect while
    quickly grafting to underlying subchondral bone, thus providing a new solution
    to the treatment of full-thickness cartilage tissue injury. Full-thickness cartilage
    lesions often are associated with a low rate of success and high patient morbidity
    (meaning 60% treatment failure) due to the need for adequate vasculature in the
    subchondral bone and integration with the cartilage graft. Researchers have used
    complex biomimetic nanomaterials and 3D printing to create strategies for joint
    repair. These materials work well in a controlled laboratory setting, but as is
    can only be printed using deposition or extrusion-based 3D printing techniques.
    This type of additive manufacturing is limited by resolution and print speed /
    volume when compared to commercial laser-based systems. The significance of this
    project is tied into improving clinical outcomes, with a more mechanically and
    biologically stable implant, while also addressing these manufacturing and cost
    issues. Thus, this project will validate the efficacy of an implantable cartilage
    repair device, made from new tissue growth materials and designs compatible with
    selective laser sintering, and provide critical scientific validation of a functional
    medical implant for orthopedic treatment."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project may be characterized by major advances in analysis of injection-molded parts, providing notable societal benefits through innovative new uses of these materials.  Of particular note in this regard is the automotive industry.  Despite the long held promise of composite materials in automotive applications, the industry has been slow to adopt widespread use of composites due to uncertainties in performance under challenging loading conditions. A successful rollout of the envisioned software will bring transformational change to this industry, leading to notable long-term societal benefits related to energy efficiency and safety.  Beyond the automotive industry, chopped fiber structural components are ubiquitous in consumer products, aerospace components, and electronics.  The company's goal is to provide accurate solutions involving complex material behavior, producing parts designed for maximum efficiency and achieved at initial fabrication rather than after multiple production iterations.  The result is a disruptive technology that will dramatically lower the cost of production.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses the immense technical challenge associated with nonlinear material modeling to failure of structural components made using chopped fiber composite materials.  The fiber volume fractions and orientations of a chopped fiber composite material produce wild microstructural configurations that may vary throughout the structure.  The problem is significantly amplified by the complex deformation mechanisms occurring in typical polymer matrix materials.  Moreover, polymer behavior is dramatically influenced by environmental and loading conditions.  Existing software solutions for the engineering analysis of chopped fiber structural components are either inadequate due to gross oversimplifications or, at the other extreme, overly complex to implement, thereby rendering them useless to the typical design engineer.  Lack of an adequate software solution results in expensive over-design and dramatically longer cycles to market. The company's goal is to provide accurate solutions involving complex material behavior, producing parts designed for maximum efficiency and achieved at initial fabrication rather than after multiple production iterations.   A hallmark of the company's software is an emphasis on simplicity while still producing high fidelity stress analyses simulating complex nonlinear material behaviors.

    Transfer (STTR) project will be the development and commercialization of a novel
    variety of corn that is high in carotenoids and orange in color, and with yields
    that are competitive with today's commercial hybrids.  In the diets of Americans,
    two important antioxidant carotenoids, lutein and zeaxanthin, are in low abundance.
    \ This deficiency has been associated with higher risk for degenerative diseases
    such as Age Related Macular Degeneration, and potentially, dementia. The ultimate
    goal of the proposed research is to get American's to consume more lutein and
    zeaxanthin, which will be achieved by increasing significantly the levels of these
    antioxidants in the most widely grown staple crop: Corn. Since corn is used in
    a wide variety of popular processed food formats, improving the carotenoid content
    of corn provides an opportunity to significantly increase the amount of health
    benefiting antioxidants that Americans consume, without changing consumers eating
    habits. However, in order for this strategy to be economically feasible, corn
    varieties that are high in carotenoids must be developed that are also high in
    grain yield. \n\nThis STTR Phase I project proposes to develop genetic markers
    for favorable alleles of genes associated with carotenoid biosynthesis and stability.
    There is considerable genetic variation in genes associated with carotenoid biosynthesis
    and stability, however, the most favorable alleles are typically not found in
    varieties that are commercially relevant to US corn production. Thus, the development
    of genetic markers will enable favorable alleles to be moved from lower yielding
    germplasm that is not well adapted to the US Corn Belt into elite inbreds suitable
    for the production of yield-competitive commercial F1 hybrids for the US market.
    The primary goal of this Phase I research is to create user-friendly genetic markers
    associated with favorable alleles for 12 key genes associated with carotenoid
    biosynthesis and stability. These markers will then be validated for efficacy
    by testing their ability to create progenies with higher carotenoid production,
    particularly lutein and zeaxanthin. This will result in a set of markers and experimental
    breeding materials that can be used to rapidly develop fixed inbreds for use in
    the production of yield-competitive high carotenoid F1 hybrids."

    is to develop a new water flood technology to increase oil recovery.  The best
    current technology is limited to 30 - 50% recovery leaving significant resources
    in the ground.  The available methods to further increase recovery are expensive,
    have limited application and can cause environmental damage.  The proposed method
    is much lower cost and has minimal environmental impact.  Our technique does not
    use chemicals or additives thus avoiding the risk of contaminating ground and
    surface water resources.  Rather than drill thousands of new wells, our approach
    revitalizes old fields and requires little modification to the existing infrastructure
    and operational procedures.  It would allow older fields to continue to operate,
    providing revenues, jobs and taxes while increasing and further diversifying our
    domestic oil reserves.  Development of these currently unrecoverable oil resources
    could enable long-term stabilization of oil prices at reasonable levels and offer
    new business opportunities for small operators.  \n\nThis STTR Phase I project
    proposes to measure the wettability in several petroleum reservoirs and to determine
    the equilibrium constants required to better describe the interaction between
    mineral surfaces and surface-active components of crude oil.  These constants
    will be added to a geochemical model to evaluate the capability of the models
    to predict wettability.  Wettability in petroleum reservoirs is poorly constrained,
    and current formulations that depend on interfacial energy cannot accurately portray
    the observations and offer little predictive capability.  The current wettability
    measurement methodologies rely on flow properties to infer interfacial energy
    because it is difficult to directly measure the interfacial energy between rock
    and oil.  Using a geochemical approach, we can explicitly represent the electrostatic
    and van der Waals force that make up the interfacial energy.  This approach will
    produce quantitative formulations of wettability that can be implemented in standard
    geochemical models.  Our goals are to demonstrate that we can measure the important
    reactions using standard chemical methodologies, that these measurements can be
    used in geochemical models to calculate wettability and that the models can be
    used to predict wettability as a function of water chemistry, for enabling techniques
    for more effective water flooding and enhanced oil recovery."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) will be the development of a dynamic thermal analysis system for use in aseptic food processing.  The true value of thermal properties for specific food products is required for the design of a thermal process to prevent possible bacterial contamination due to underheating, or degradation and formation of unwanted compounds due to overheating.  The proposed innovation would allow food processors to improve their understanding of thermal properties in rapid heating applications, and by validating novel food processing technologies. The impact is expected to be that the quality and nutritional value of aseptic processed foods should increase dramatically as it will eliminate the need to excessively overcook products to ensure their safety. The commercial impact of this research will be through enhancing the quality of aseptic processed food and of rapidly heated batter-based foods. As the aseptic food quality will be further enhanced compared to that of canned and frozen alternatives, this technology will also increase the growth of the rapidly growing aseptic food industry.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to develop a commercial prototype device capable of rapidly measuring the thermal properties of a material over a range of temperatures. Currently, there is no way to quickly measure properties, which are necessary for accurate modeling of rapid heating processes such as those used for aseptic food processing and for foods baked between hot irons, such as burgers. Without rapid measurement, the food product deteriorates before taking measurements. Phase I research should develop, build, and validate a physical prototype and associated software. Control and data acquisition software, along with data analysis and parameter estimation software, will be finalized and validated. The device will be tested against materials with known parameters to statistically validate its performance and accuracy. Finally the device will be tested alongside the prior state-of-the-art to compare its performance to the industry standard. The product of this research will be a commercially-viable prototype that has been validated against literature values and has been demonstrated to outperform current devices. The device will be able to measure parameters over a range of temperatures more accurately and in a fraction of the time of current methodology.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project includes high quality data that indicates a population?s sense of well-being and environmental safety--two essential factors in the effort for long-term sustainability. MindRider and Multimer collect and analyze human signals at the neighborhood, town, city, and regional scale, thus providing proactive, standardized, geospatial, real-time information to improve both personal mobility and urban monitoring. MindRider and Multimer can help overcome limitations in two prevalent monitoring methods: 1) A reactive methodology for quantifying danger is to count accidents. While government-collected accident data is often reliable and includes many years' worth of information, it does not provide precise spatial details such as direction of movement. Most importantly, an injury or fatality must occur before a statistic is produced, which therefore misses all the non-reported minor injuries, as well as perceptions of danger. 2) Many researchers use qualitative instruments like surveys and interviews to study perceptions of safety without the occurrence of an accident But while qualitative methods are highly valuable, these methods cannot be deployed continuously, are often not geospatial, and their results may not be standardized.

    The proposed project addresses the challenges that stakeholders like transportation planners and real estate analysts encounter as they monitor rapid change in cities and towns. For these stakeholders, improved data helps to reduce the complexity, cost, and risk of site selection decisions like choosing the location for a store, transit hub, outdoor advertisement, home, or office. Existing location analysis tools show similar kinds of evaluations for very different neighborhoods, based on limited data that doesn't often change. MindRider, which pairs custom ergonomic biosensors with GPS-enabled smartphones to record EEG and location data, and Multimer, which categorizes and analyzes MindRider data against existing geographic inputs, has the potential to provide key insights for data-driven decision making. We have built the basic system to collect and analyze geolocated biosensor data and have proven the technical feasibility of collecting these data from a pilot sample population for an extended period of time. Our primary objective for Phase I is to improve our data modeling and analysis--with a focus on affective interpretation, biosensor comparison, geospatial and temporal statistics, and reproducibility--so as to offer a fully robust product that stakeholders will confidently integrate into their existing workflows.

    This STTR Phase 1 project seeks to develop an automated system that would significantly increase the speed and accuracy of biopsy assessments at the point of care. The proposed technology eliminates extensive manual tissue processing steps and generates digital images of fresh biopsies that look just like standard pathology slides. The imaging can be performed in seconds, thus improving the efficiency of biopsy assessments at the point of care. Rapid, whole fresh biopsy imaging also improves evaluation accuracy while maximally preserving tissue for further testing and facilitating remote pathology consultation. With over five million patients in the United States undergoing biopsy procedures each year, and one in five of those patients returning for repeat procedures due to inaccuracies in biopsy assessments, an increase in accuracy and procedure speed could have a profound impact. This could lead to decreases in patient procedure time and decreases in repeat procedure rates, preventing unnecessary, painful, and invasive repeat biopsy procedures. With an estimated 1.6 billion USD spend on repeat procedures per year, this would also represent a significant decrease in financial burden on patients. In addition, due to the decrease in time per procedure, this could increase procedure throughput for hospitals, thus increasing hospital revenue potential. Finally, by producing remotely viewable images, this system could be utilized in a remote pathology setting at underserved communities within the US.

    This STTR Phase I project seeks to develop an automated sample processing and tissue pathology imaging system that delivers biopsy-to-image in a completely automated manner on fully-intact fresh tissues within five minutes of tissue removal.  Through integration with the previously developed Video-Rate Structured Illumination Microscopy (VR-SIM) system as the integrated optical sectioning modality, and using novel fluorescence dye combinations that recapitulate gold-standard histology,  the throughput, efficiency, and accuracy of biopsy evaluation can be improved while maximally preserving tissue for downstream processing and readily facilitating telepathology consultation. Preliminary work in multiple fresh tissue preparations, including core-needle biopsies and whole surgical resections,  indicates that the technology and method can deliver high image quality and diagnostic accuracy in short, clinically-relevant timeframes. A prototype of an automated, disposable cartridge system for biopsy staining and imaging for effortless integration with VR-SIM imaging will be developed. Image quality will be optimized at the highest optical sectioning power to be equivalent to physically-sectioned tissues, using polarization-gated VR-SIM and novel immersion media. ADPL workflow testing, validation of diagnostic image quality, and verification of compatibility with downstream analysis in human biopsy samples will be completed.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project lies in helping more amputees walk safely with less effort. There are approximately 800,000 individuals living with a major lower limb amputation, and this number is growing largely due to diabetes. For 50,000 amputees each year who need a new prosthetic knee, two options exist:  learn to use a traditional prosthetic knee or attempt to obtain a high-tech, computer-controlled knee. The former require the amputee learn and execute specific technique(s) to walk safely, while the latter do so automatically but cost $30,000 to $100,000 and require physical qualification, greatly limiting their availability. The novel prosthetic knee developed here offers stability automatically, regardless of amputee technique. It prevents buckling while simultaneously allowing the user to walk safely with whatever leg motions the user is able to generate. Since it requires no electronics or power, it is available to all amputees regardless of ability, and at a fraction of the cost of high-tech knees. Amputees will be able to walk farther with less effort, improving health and quality of life, and easing caregiver burden. Additionally, this design could be adapted for use in orthotic, robotic or exoskeletal systems.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop and test a novel prosthetic knee. Funding would be used to build prototypes and conduct mechanical, analytical and destructive testing. This testing is necessary to demonstrate that the design is feasible, safe for humans, and deserving of further development with amputees. An independent engineering design review will be obtained, prototypes will then be bench tested for function in a biomechanics lab, and an independent lab will provide destructive testing to prove ultimate strength of the device for comparison against known standards. The anticipated technical results include proof that the device can support the weight of a 300lb person, and quantitative evidence that the device will afford intuitive and universally available stability to amputees through its innovative swing- and stance-phase functionality. This work would advance the knowledge of prosthetics, rehabilitation and bipedal locomotion.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to reduce the power required to cool the data and telecommunications centers that drive the internet age. Currently nearly 2.0% of the energy consumed in the United States is used to run such data centers and, often, half of this is used for cooling. The corresponding greenhouse gas emissions will also be reduced. Longer term this technology can be adapted to increasing the efficiency of air-conditioning/refrigeration and power generation. Commercially, the computational fluid dynamics software market the product will compete in is projected to grow from $1.3 billion at present to over $2 billion by 2022. It will also stimulate the growth of the manufacture of specialty heat sinks with optimal geometries for efficient thermal management.

    This intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase I project is based on proposing to hybridize three common numerical methods, i.e., computational fluid dynamics (CFD), flow network modeling (FNM) and multi-variable optimization (MVO), a non-trivial objective. The result will be a software platform that can accurately and simultaneously optimize the geometry of an array of heat sinks found in various types of circuit packs, e.g., blade servers in data centers. This is not possible with CFD alone as it is too slow and it is not possible with FNM alone as it is not sufficiently accurate. The method of the hybrid approach to preserve the accuracy of CFD is to embed pre-computed, non-dimensional look-up tables of flow and thermal resistances from CFD simulations in an FNM. The software will accommodate both single-phase flows of air and water and evaporating/boiling flows of water and refrigerant, which requires modeling complex heat, mass and momentum transport phenomena. Experiments will validate its accuracy on thermal mock-ups of circuit packs.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) project is the creation of a control system that enables the next
    generation of high capacity lithium metal batteries to replace current lithium
    ion battery technology. The global lithium-ion battery market is expected to grow
    to $67.70 billion USD by end of 2022 from $31.17 billion USD in 2016. However,
    lithium ion batteries cannot store sufficient energy required by the applications
    contributing most to that growth (i.e., electric vehicles) as demonstrated by
    the slow adoption within the largest battery powered product markets today.  Lithium
    metal batteries were conceived decades ago and are capable of storing three times
    the energy of lithium ion batteries.  Yet inherent chemical instability renders
    them extremely dangerous to recharge, preventing their use.  This project is the
    next phase of work to develop a system that monitors and maintains the stability
    of lithium metal batteries during charging, enabling safe and reliable use by
    consumers, businesses, and government.  The complete solution will consist of
    licensable hardware and software which can be tailored to specific battery powered
    applications, integrating with battery cells or charging systems for consumer
    electronics, long range electric vehicles, medical devices, and grid storage systems.
    \ \n\nThis SBIR Phase I project funds the continued development of a new paradigm
    in battery healing: maintaining battery electrode health from the outside in.
    The system uses software and electronics that control surface issues on battery
    electrodes which otherwise cause permanent loss of capacity and life during normal
    use.  As an important part of the overall solution being developed, the key technical
    hurdles addressed by this proposed SBIR project are focused on real-time electrode
    surface sensing and mapping capabilities and control strategies to suppress dendrites,
    as well as advanced characterization methods to monitor and share electrode health
    information with other components to ensure safety, reliability and durability
    of the overall energy storage system. The R&D plan will include development of
    live mapping of electrochemically active surfaces, control software to develop
    an algorithm and feedback system, and machine learning to improve sensing-mapping-control
    strategies.  The most promising set of solutions will be demonstrated and validated
    in an operando visualization test cell that allows observation of the formation
    and suppression of dendrites on lithium metal electrodes.\n\nThis award reflects
    NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
    using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

    This SBIR Phase I project will explore the technical, commercial, and educational potentials of bringing augmented reality binocular kiosks to public locations and their ability to create lasting impact on the public's understanding of a place. The proposed research and development phase will focus on the deployment and field testing of a collection of prototypes with partner locations, and examine their efficacy at engaging and informing visitors of those sites. The broader significance of the project is the development of an information device and ecosystem that gives the public a better understanding of notable places and the greater physical world. Deployments will be able to visualize a variety of site-specific data, from environmental conditions, to geological formations and landmark navigation. Potential revenue can be generated in partnership with locations, allowing for sustainable long-term engagements between the project and a site. Direct economic impact is brought to a location and its surroundings through increased foot traffic and the encouragement of additional exploration of a space.


    The innovation being proposed is stereoscopic wide-field-of-view see-through augmented reality viewers in the form of landscape binocular kiosks designed to give public spaces a way to engage visitors with the natural, scientific, and historic features of that location. In addition to displaying immersive media experiences optically overlaid onto a view of the real world, this project creates a distributed media network on that location to share data and content for remote viewing and analysis. Goals and scope of research include durability testing of the devices in prolonged public exposure, effectiveness of the user interface and software tools, understanding the range and bandwidth of device-to-device communication, and optimization of the optical, electromechanical, and sensor components. Methods and approaches will include the field testing of prototype units with partner locations, and using survey and analysis techniques to evaluate the overall quantitative and qualitative efficacy of the intervention at those sites.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to provide analytical technology that will foster the commercial development of complicated biomanufactured products. The most pressing need is to reduce the time and cost to bring the latest generation of biotherapeutic drugs to market. Currently, upwards of eight years and $1B is spent to move a candidate drug from discovery through final approval. Along the way $300M is consumed by analytical testing procedures to certify the product.  The American healthcare system will benefit from new and less expensive analytical technologies that reduce certification costs and lead to less expensive drugs. Manufacturing efficiency also can be improved using the proposed technology. Biomanufactured products are harvested from cultured cells, and there are times when the culturing process fails to produce a perfect product. Detecting impurities and spoilage during manufacturing will further reduce manufacturing costs and directly benefit the consumer through the delivery of better therapeutic products and treatment regimens.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to quantify the validity of an ion mobility spectrometer as a high-throughput tool for screening conformational variation, purity, and aggregation of biotherapeutic drugs. Conformation imparts functionality to a protein and any variation in conformation implies there is a variation in biochemical activity, which is undesirable. Ion mobility is a technique that determines molecular cross-section, which in turn is a measure of a molecule's conformation. The gold standard for determining protein conformation is x-ray crystallography, a methodology limited by throughput. There is an unmet need to develop faster ways to measure protein conformation. The proposed technology determines a protein conformation rapidly across all phases of biotherapeutic drug development from discovery, expression system testing, scale up and manufacturing. Additionally, the patented design for this ion mobility spectrometer provides a way to measure changes in conformation that might result as a consequence of exposure to thermal, chemical, and photo-induced stress as needed for drug stability and developability testing.  The proposed work will quantify resolution, reproducibility, accuracy, and throughput for this benchtop instrument. The evaluation will be performed using antigen-antibody pairs and several biotherapeutic drugs in collaboration with an academic group and industry partners.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to sell affordable backup generators that provide 23 kilowatts, for operating a home's lights and appliances. With power outages due to natural disasters and an aging power grid becoming ever more frequent, and with society increasingly reliant on electricity to power not only lights and household appliances, but also computers, wireless routers, and medical devices, back-up power is an increasingly critical need. This SBIR's portable generator is expected to be more than an order of magnitude lower cubic size and weight, all at a reduced cost compared to existing generators.  The broader impact of this project is its significant benefits to the environment by providing backup power at high fuel efficiency (i.e. less consumption of non-renewable fossil fuels) and low emissions of hydrocarbons, particulate matter, carbon monoxide, and smoke.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to address the shortcomings of residential-use backup generators currently on the market. Available backup generators are either small and affordable but can only power a single appliance; or able to power most of a home's needs but cumbersome and expensive. This project will demonstrate the potential for implementing a free-piston internal combustion engine that will maximize fuel efficiency; minimize size; decrease dependence on lubricating oil; and incorporate an engine management system. The objective of the current effort is the engine, while the functioning compact generator will be developed in the next phase. In this free-piston engine design, the two pistons oscillate with forces in balance and reduced side-loads to the pistons, yielding a long-lasting high-speed engine. The pilot work included modification of the cylinder intake ports; addition of a modified squish band and dome to the cylinder head; and use of low-friction bearing materials yielding a successful prototype that runs on regular gasoline. The engineers will continue implementing, testing, and improving on these modifications. The successful completion of this project will yield an efficient, compact, low-weight, and low-emissions generator that produces 23 kilowatts of usable power that runs on standard pump gasoline.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is an innovative
    new capacitor technology based on kilohertz high-frequency supercapacitor, called
    AC-Supercap, aiming to replace conventional aluminum electrolytic capacitors (AECs)
    for a vast range of electronic and power systems. Capacitors are an essential
    component used in electronic devices, in power supplies driving electrical machines,
    appliances and instruments, as well as in power conversion and conditioning systems
    used for renewable energy generation. In the consumer electronics sector, miniaturization
    and low-profile or even flexible packaging, and higher power efficiency are some
    of the key demands. In the power system and other power-demanding industry sectors,
    large capacitance, large ripple current absorption, and high temperature rating
    are the key requirements. With the emergence of distributed wireless sensors and
    Internet of Things (IoT), pulse energy storage and generation will be necessary
    as well. AC-Supercap, with its much better performance than current solutions,
    is anticipated to better serve the needs of broad range of customers. Upon the
    success of this technology, there will also be tremendous impact on the local
    ecosystem and regional community of West Texas. \n\nThis Small Business Technology
    Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will investigate the feasibility of producing
    AC-Supercap as high-performance alternating current (AC) filtering capacitors
    for power modules, on-board application, or as compact and efficient pulse power
    storage. Conventional AECs, limited by their low capacitance density, bulky size,
    poor lifetime, large equivalent series resistance, and polarity sensitivity cannot
    meet technical needs well. To achieve AC-Supercaps with both large capacitance
    density and high-frequency response, two contradictory requirements, and nanostructured
    electrode engineering will be investigated. To produce a compact capacitor with
    a large voltage rating and capacitance, multicell integration will be optimally
    designed and demonstrated, which is crucial considering the intrinsic low voltage
    rating of a single cell. The proposed innovative solutions to these technical
    challenges will de-risk the AC-Supercap product prototyping in the following project
    phases to make ready the technology for commercialization. These research activities
    will advance the scientific understanding and technological development of nanostructured
    electrode process and property control, multicell integration design, and particularly
    AC-Supercap technology.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
    been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will demonstrate the ability to create a new family of biobased and biodegradable polymers produced from agricultural and forestry waste streams that have the potential to mitigate landfill-bound, single-use plastics prevalent in agricultural operations. In conventional agricultural operations, farmers use plastic mulch films to block weeds and retain moisture in the soil, ultimately increasing crop yields. Unfortunately, the non-degradable plastics that are used must be removed after harvest and sent to a landfill as they are not recyclable due to contamination by soil and pesticides, leading to significant labor and disposal costs and increasing environmental burden. In this project, lignin polymer alloys are investigated as an innovative biodegradable plastic platform which can be used as an alternative to conventional materials that are not recyclable. Agriculture films represent a global market of $2.5 billion. Other attractive market opportunities include agricultural containers ($5 billion), garbage bags ($10 billion), and packaging ($115 billion). Lignin as a renewable feedstock is an excellent candidate for low cost, biodegradable plastics. Successful demonstration of commercial-scale uses for lignin is vital for the emerging biorefinery industry, and a primary task to secure the energy and materials future for the US.

    The intellectual merit of this project addresses the need for low-cost, biobased plastics to replace petroleum derived materials, while ensuring a closed-loop lifecycle that does not generate financial and environmental burden due to waste accumulation. To date, lignin-based polymers have been prohibitively expensive due to the need for extensive solvent-based modification and separations processes. The objective of this research project is to demonstrate the production of lignin-polymer alloys with: 1) unmodified lignin contents of 50% or higher through solvent-free, high shear melt processing; 2) enhanced interfacial surface area for material durability; 3) mechanical properties near or exceeding that of low-density polyethylene; and 4) biodegradability under both ambient soil and thermophilic composting conditions. The expected technical results will be production of at least 1 optimal formulation meeting the above conditions identified as suitable for use in agricultural mulch film applications. If all 4 of these are achieved, further research in a subsequent Phase II award will allow for demonstration of scaled manufacturing of this new family of sustainable biomaterials and has the potential to lead to some of the first commercially viable lignin-based plastics in the US for use in agricultural plastic applications and beyond.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be a revolutionary, high-speed, high-resolution and extremely high-sensitivity camera. This Quanta Image Sensor (QIS) camera will be the only compact complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) camera in the market with photon counting capability at room temperature. This camera can be used in scientific and medical imaging applications where high sensitivity is extremely important and the current state-of-the-art camera technologies cannot satisfy the needs of the consumers, and customers are desperately seeking a better camera solution. The QIS is a platform imaging technology and can be used in a broad range of imaging applications, such as automotive, augmented-reality & virtual-reality, security & surveillance, etc., where high-sensitivity, high-resolution and high-speed are required. Moreover, since the QIS technology is compatible with the mainstream CMOS fabrication lines, it has the potential to dominate the image sensor and camera market by high-volume production. The image sensor market is expected to expand at an annual growth rate of 10.4% from 2015 to 2021, reaching $18.8 billion market value by 2021.

    The proposed project addresses the major drawbacks of the state-of-the-art scientific EMCCD cameras, such as high noise (around 1 electron with external cooling), nonlinear response and unpredictable readout gain, low-resolution, low-speed, massive size and extremely high power consumption. In this project, a manufactured QIS test chip will be implemented into a 1 megapixel prototype QIS camera which can function at 1000 frames/s and the whole camera power consumption will be less than a Watt. The average noise will be around 0.21 electrons that unlocks the true photon-number-resolving at room temperature with about 99% accuracy. The modular compact QIS camera will contain some peripheral digital IC chips, power supplies, FPGA, USB 3 interface, etc. A QIS image processing algorithm will be implemented in the camera module to form and output images from the binary bits received from the imager. Advanced industrial and commercial standard tests and characterizations will be performed to comprehensively measure the performance of the prototype QIS camera. Also, the camera will be tested by alpha-customers and their feedbacks will be received. In order to improve the development, the results will be applied in future QIS cameras in the Phase II of the SBIR program.

    This SBIR Phase I project will explore the potential benefits of a sine wave shaped wheel compared to a traditional circular wheel for the central pivot irrigation industry. The central pivot irrigation industry is an essential segment of the agriculture industry and this project aims to deliver a superior wheel that solves the persistent issue of trench-digging that leads to equipment breakdown, down time, lost profits, and crop-loss. The broader significance of eliminating trench-digging would be significant savings for farmers, distributors and consumers. Agriculture is the largest industry in the world, and developing a wheel that eliminates an issue that plagues the industry is the central goal of this project. The development of a sine wave wheel also potentially impact other fields as the technology can be used in over one-hundred different industries.


    The technical innovation of this project is creating a wheel that is non-circular. The wheel will exhibit the blending of multiple shapes in one design including a sine wave, cube, circle and hexagon. It will be approximately 4.5 feet tall, and weighing approximately 400lbs for use in the farming industry. The concept is to create two wheels in tandem where the sine waves are out-of-phase from one another. The front wheel would create a left-right-left path into the soil, much like the path a snake would leave behind traversing soil. The rear wheel would move in an opposite right-left-right configuration leaving a double helix footprint in its wake. The opposing wheels would push the soil back toward center, eliminating the largest issue plaguing the industry: trench digging. The sine wave wheel technology has already been scientifically proven on a smaller scale in the skateboarding industry to reduce friction, increase longevity, increase off-road ability, and increase speed. Multiple wheel iterations will be manufactured and subsequently tested in this project using off-the-shelf hubs within the industry and rubber tires. The wheel will not be pneumatic and will never go flat.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to develop a cell-based platform technology that can sense inflammatory sites and respond by producing anti-inflammatory factors to treat autoimmune diseases. There are more than 80 types of autoimmune disease with more than 23.5 million Americans affected. Autoimmune diseases are the number one cause of morbidity for women in the U.S., and one of the top 10 causes of death for women under 65 years old. The annual healthcare burden of these diseases is estimated at more than $100 billion in the U.S. alone. Current treatments for autoimmune diseases are effective for some patients, but a majority either do not respond or become refractory. Furthermore, standard drugs result in systemic immune suppression, which can cause severe and chronic side effects. Hence, there is substantial market need for anti-inflammatory drugs that can act locally at the site of inflammation, and deliver the "right dose at the right time" depending on the severity of the flare. If successful, the adaptive cell therapy platform being developed in this proposal will serve as the basis for a next-generation therapy to existing biologics.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a cell-based technology that localizes to a site of inflammation, senses inflammatory signals, and triggers the release of anti-inflammatory agents. The substantial technical and clinical progress made in recent years in synthetic biology and cell therapies is enabling development of this type of product. The goal is to design and optimize synthetic gene circuits to program cells to locally sense inflammatory signals such as TNFalpha and release anti-TNF drugs. The plan is to introduce these circuits into adult stem cells that have been used safely in numerous clinical trials against autoimmune diseases and have a well-established commercial development path. The engineered cells will be tested in culture to show input/output response to different levels of TNFalpha, and then tested in mouse models of disease. If successful, lead candidates will be further developed in a Phase II application.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve the safety of firefighters through the research and development of a real-time, wearable sensor system comprising a biometric heads-up display and accompanying analysis tools. This device collects each firefighter?s vital signs in real-time, displays the information via a heads-up display, and alerts them if they are in danger. Simultaneously, it will send the data to authorized officials for real-time strategic decision-making. By receiving access to life-critical information, the commander can make informed decisions on the allocation of key resources during the hectic scene of an emergency. Firefighting is chaotic; every year over one million firefighters risk their lives to protect others. Over 50% of the deaths in firefighting are caused by overexertion and stress, which can induce heart attacks as well as other serious medical issues. Furthermore, around 70,000 firefighting injuries occur each year. The proposed system aims to reduce the amount of firefighting injuries and subsequent costs, which totaled $7.8 billion in 2004, but the design is not limited to firefighting. The proposed system can be easily adapted to serve similar occupations such as military personnel and industrial workers.

    The proposed project may be the first to monitor the effects of the extreme nature of fire incidents with physiological stressors and provide this data in real-time. The proposed technology could significantly improve the occupational safety of firefighters and further enhance the scientific knowledge created by studying their physiological states. The proposed project includes three main technical objectives: 1) The research and development of a rugged wearable system that will monitor the physiology of firefighters in real-time. 2) The research and development of a machine learning algorithm to identify key markers that will indicate the exertion and stamina levels of first responders in chaotic environments. 3) The development of a long-range radio system capable of transmission within large urban structures comprising various possible interferences. All three objectives will consist of two pilot studies with an intermittent development phase in between, where feedback from the first pilot study will be incorporated into both the hardware and software. It is expected that the outcomes of this project will demonstrate a significant reduction in firefighter injuries, paving the way for a clear return on investment for the partnering fire departments.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is an improvement in how artificial limbs (prostheses)
    are fitted to the individual user. This promises better rehabilitation outcomes
    for people with limb loss, which lowers the risk of long-term health issues, such
    as accidental falls, back pain, or conditions that are associated with a sedentary
    lifestyle. All those risks can carry substantial direct and indirect costs for
    the individual and the society at large. There are approximately 2 million Americans
    who are living with limb loss, and who will potentially benefit from better prosthesis
    fit. Beyond the expected long-term benefits, these individuals will experience
    immediate benefits that include a more inconspicuous gait pattern, a reduction
    in skin and muscle soreness, and an increase in activity radius. The commercial
    impact of this research will extend to the industry of prosthetic componentry
    manufacturing. Currently, the structural elements of prostheses are mass-produced,
    strictly mechanical components. The proposed work will entail the integration
    of miniature sensors into those components, which will make them more valuable,
    and - along with the economical long-term benefits - justify higher unit prices
    and thereby a substantial growth potential for this $400M market. \n \nThe proposed
    project is focused on optimizing the static alignment of limb prostheses. This
    alignment needs to be carefully fine-tuned to each individual user of a prosthesis.
    The associated work is the domain of the prosthetist, who depends on experience,
    patient feedback, and intuition to achieve acceptable results. There are currently
    no easy ways to measure and track alignment changes throughout this process and
    therefore no data-based approaches to improving it. In the proposed project, small
    scale sensors will be integrated into the conventional alignable prosthesis components.
    These will provide continuous, accurate real-time measurements of alignment changes.
    It is planned to make those measurements available to the prosthetist via smartphone
    or tablet PC, so that they can help streamline the alignment optimization process.
    In the future, if it is possible to analyze the so collected data from thousands
    of alignment procedures, scientific methods can be applied to solve the problem
    of imperfect prosthesis alignments. The proposed work will be focused on customizing
    the sensors and associated hardware to existing standard components without making
    them much heavier or more expensive. Preliminary tests of the device with a sample
    of prosthetists are part of the planned Phase 1 project as well."

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project lies in the
    widespread nature of the problem of airborne Black (BC) and Brown (BrC) carbon
    particulates.  These are formed from combustion processes such as motor vehicles
    and ships, forest fires and biomass burning, as well as indoor cooking in developing
    countries.  BC and BrC are important components of atmospheric aerosols (small
    airborne solid and liquid particles) that affect air quality, visibility and climate.
    \ The World Health Organization estimates that nearly 7 million premature deaths
    globally in 2012 were linked to air pollution, and black carbon-containing aerosols
    are often singled out as a major contributor due to their strong linkages to adverse
    health effects.  Accurate and robust monitoring of BC (and BrC) at a lower cost
    is necessary in urban and industrial areas throughout the United States and abroad
    to provide adequate temporal and spatial measurements that can be used to assess
    regional air quality models and estimate community exposure risks.  This information
    will then make it possible for local and regional government agencies to develop
    mitigation strategies that protect the health of their communities. \n\nThis Small
    Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the problem of accurate
    and inexpensive Black Carbon (BC) measurements by developing a long-path photometer
    to quantify airborne BC and BrC particulates.  The most common commercially-available
    technique for BC and BrC requires collection of particulates on a filter. This
    filter introduces numerous artefacts requiring complicated corrections.  Other
    existing techniques are quite expensive and require significant expertise to operate.
    \ The Black Carbon Photometer (BCP) to be developed here will not require pre-concentration
    on a filter, thus providing a direct, correction-free measurement.  It will be
    operationally simple and require little maintenance, similar to photometers routinely
    used in monitoring networks for gas phase species such as ozone.  The initial
    BCP will be low power, portable and is projected to cost less than currently available
    BC analyzers.  Thus, it should provide researchers in air quality and public health,
    as well as those in monitoring agencies, a practical and economical alternative
    to existing technologies."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to significantly reduce primary care physician shortages and improve quality of care for low income patients in the United States by developing a tool that analyzes clinical care team performance data at federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) to automatically deploy individually tailored eLearning support for staff members that enables patient centered team based care.  FQHCs are funded by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to serve 22 million low income patients living in more than 10,000 of the poorest communities across the Nation.  Well-implemented patient centered team-based care has the potential to significantly reduce physician shortages and burden of chronic disease which disproportionately affects low income communities. However, efforts to move and sustain FQHCs participation in this model have had limited success with only 66% attaining patient centered medical home (PCMH) recognition in 2016.  Various public initiatives, including the Health Resources and Service Administration Quality Improvement Award and Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act (MACRA), are providing additional financial incentives to move primary care practices towards PCMH Recognition. However, current approaches to practice transformation are cumbersome and difficult to sustain.

    The proposed project seeks to disrupt continued health professional education at FQHCs by assessing the feasibility of developing a tool that leverages electronic health record data to identify gaps in patient centered team based care for diabetic patients and deploys tailored asynchronous individualized e-learning nudge type support to each member of the care team based on their performance.  The research objectives of this SBIR Phase 1 are to establish the feasibility of using EHR data through an API to trigger individual user and team level flags for variation from a specific set of PCMH standards and diabetes clinical protocols; to develop algorithms that generate an individualized learner user profile and teams level reports; to generate data to design algorithms that learn from user preferences, impacts on flags and patient outcomes; to design user interphase for reward and recognition and to evaluate end user acceptance of eLearning tools.  The research will be approached using user centric design, behavioral economics and adult learning principles to gather specific requirements and develop a minimum viable product focused on a subset of between five to 10 indicators.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable the development of a unique wearable
    scuba-diving device that will eliminate the risk of Decompression Sickness (DCS),
    by monitoring in real time the formation of nitrogen bubbles in the body of the
    user while in the dive. The risk to develop DCS while conducting underwater activities
    occurs during the ascension phase, when the changing pressure may yield the formation
    of nitrogen bubbles in tissues and body. The presence of bubbles triggers a variety
    of serious injuries with long term consequences and even death. Any professional
    and licensed recreational scuba training makes trainees aware about the risks
    associated to DCS. Divers are instructed to follow ascent rates and safety stops
    according with criteria established from statistical considerations of empirical
    data. Nevertheless, DCS is suffered by rule-abiding divers during 3% of the immersions,
    requiring costly and distressing evacuation and treatment with hyperbaric chambers.
    The wearable device will alert the scuba-diver before the sickness develops, reducing
    the risk to suffer DCS, making underwater activities simpler and safer. \n\nThe
    proposed project plans to demonstrate an innovative ultrasonic resonant concept
    adapted from the acoustic chamber notion. Acoustic chambers are structures which
    are belted by piezoelectric arrangements which are set to deform expanding and
    compressing when subjected to oscillating electric voltages. The frequency of
    oscillations can be set to match the modes of vibration of the media entering
    in resonance. Under such conditions the setup is extremely sensitive to minor
    changes in the elastic properties of the system, such as those induced by the
    presence of compressible bubbles. This project will execute a plan to produce
    a wearable design of the piezoelectric array. Artificial intelligence as well
    as conventional methods will be employed to analyze the electrical disturbances,
    and relate them to the bubbles sizes in real time. The computing, data acquisition
    and power requirements will be determined. Ultimately, these results will determine
    the feasibility to integrate all the required components in an autonomous wearable
    DCS risk detection device by a scuba diver."

    demonstrate the commercial feasibility of a manufacturing platform for functionalizing
    textile materials with smart functionality such as for wearable smart garments
    developed out of the NSF funded ASSIST Engineering Research Center for Self-powered
    Wearable Nanosystems. Smart garments have been touted as the next sensing platform
    for acquiring biometrics such as electrocardiogram, heart rate, or heart rate
    variability. However, mass adoption has been difficult due to the high production
    cost, leading to a small market segment within the greater wearable technology
    market. As demonstrated by our customer discovery through the NSF I-Corps program
    in Fall 2016, the biggest barrier to adoption is the production cost. This project
    seeks to decrease the cost by 5x and decrease production time by 36x, enabling
    this market segment to grow for applications in health & wellness, healthcare,
    and beyond. By employing high-throughput direct-write printing and deposition
    of functional dielectric and conductive materials from the printed electronics
    space, high-value data generating devices such as smart garments can be manufactured
    in a single step bridging established practices within the textile and electronics
    industry resulting in automated textile electronics. Novel materials will be explored
    to impart functionalities on existing textiles with our manufacturing platform.
    \n\nThe broader impact of this project is to create a single manufacturing platform
    that marginalizes the cost of production for textile electronics such as smart

    creating new knowledge and commercial innovations. Lastly, manufacturing within
    the USA has seen a resurgence due to value-added technical textiles manufacturing
    being brought back. An ancillary broader impact of this project is to serve as
    a driver for value-added smart garment manufacturing technologies to be employed
    for USA manufacturing. Success of this project's vision will allow for low-cost

    This SBIR Phase I project will help advance the health and welfare of individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS) - a debilitating chronic inflammatory disease affecting nearly 1 million people in the United States. A non-invasive, wearable retinal imaging device will be developed for at-home patient use that detects changes in MS disease activity, enabling patients and their physicians to track responses to treatment and detect disease flare-ups between clinical visits. Early detection and proper treatment of MS is crucial to reducing the risk of disease progression and disability. Current practice relies on infrequent neurological and radiological exams to assess changes in disease activity and treatment efficacy. However, there is currently no way to monitor MS in real time between these visits. Research relating retinal pathology to MS processes in the brain demonstrate that retinal imaging can provide early detection of disease events, offering an alternative monitoring pathway. This device will thus help reduce increases in patient healthcare costs associated with increasing disability, and potentially impact the research and care of patients with other brain conditions that manifest in the retina, including traumatic brain injury, epilepsy, and addiction. Following FDA approval, the device will be sold to MS patients, neurologists, and researchers.

    This project will yield a novel retinal imaging device that uses optical coherence tomography (OCT) and fundus autofluorescence (FAF) to assess retinal biomarkers associated with MS progression. While OCT and FAF are widely-used modalities for imaging the retina, the proposed device differentiates itself from current technologies in that it is specifically designed for use by MS patients at home. This will include a ruggedized, ergonomic, and wearable design suited for those who suffer from low mobility and other symptoms that make trips to a clinic difficult. Patients will use the device briefly once a week, during which time retinal images will be automatically acquired, analyzed, and sent to a physician for remote review. As such, it will further increase engagement between patients and physicians by making patients more proactively involved in their disease management. For this project, the following objectives are planned: 1) Develop the OCT component of the device to acquire high-resolution and repeatable images of layers in a healthy tissue-mimicking phantom retina, 2) Develop the FAF component of the device, and 3) Validate the device?s ability to acquire high-resolution and repeatable images of retinal layer thicknesses and autofluorescence in post-mortem retinas from MS patients and healthy individuals.

    medicine combines the principles of the life sciences, cell biology, and engineering
    to create functional tissues and organs that can be used for replacing damaged

    contrast agent, trityl that has oxygen-dependent relaxation rates. EPROI provides
    absolute partial oxygen pressure (pO2) maps with high accuracy (~ 1 torr) within
    1-10 minutes. The oxygen imager will be equipped with a 25 mT magnet and ~720
    MHz electronics suitable for in vitro and small animal in vivo oxygen imaging.
    The instrument will have user-friendly software for image acquisition, image registration,
    data processing and analysis. This project will develop the magnet with the top
    loading of samples along with temperature and gas controlled bioreactor sample
    chamber for in vitro oxygen mapping of artificial tissues. The robustness and
    performance of the imager will be tested by acquiring oxygen maps of cell-seeded

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase I project aims at developing a roll-to-roll, solid-state, continuous process for manufacturing nanocellular thermoplastic films with open (interconnected) or closed (not interconnected) cells of the order 10-100 nm and as much as 50% porosity. The initial application of this proposed project is an improved Lithium-ion battery separator comprising a nanoporous polyetherimide (PEI) film of 10-25-micron thickness with uniformly distributed interconnected 10-50 nm size cells. The nanoporous PEI separator, which has significantly higher heat resistance than current polyolefin-based separators, addresses a very urgent safety issue, i.e., batteries exploding and causing fire due to thermal instability of the separator. Moreover, compared to the current multi-step process for fabricating battery separators, this continuous process will have higher productivity thereby increasing the nation's global competitiveness in battery manufacturing. The total addressable global market for separators used in both primary (single-use) and secondary (rechargeable) lithium batteries is projected to be $1.65 billion by 2020 growing at 4.7%. This innovative research project will contribute to new knowledge in the areas of gas diffusion and cell nucleation in thermoplastic polymeric films and enable development, characterization and application of a whole new class of solid-state nanocellular polymer films.

    The intellectual merit of this project resides in the development of a manufacturing process that brings together interdisciplinary knowledge to synthesize and characterize nanostructures under various process conditions. This new knowledge will advance the field of nanomanufacturing and will be used to optimize processes towards commercialization targets. There are two technical challenges: (i) the dynamic seal concept, which has been proven in a 250-micron thick polymer film but not for a film 10-20 times lower in thickness; and (ii) maintaining enough gas concentration during the cell nucleation and growth to create nano-sized cells. The goals of this project are to: (a) establish the feasibility of a roll-to-roll process operating at a minimum speed of 1 meter/minute to produce nanocellular thermoplastic films and (b) develop a 100-mm wide, 10-25 micron thick nanoporous polyetherimide (PEI) film having the desired properties and nanostructure profile for a Li-ion battery separator application. These two goals will be achieved by implementing the dynamic seal technology to process a 100-mm wide film on a continuous basis and immediately heating the film to create nanocells.

    development of a wireless sensor for continuous and real-time measurement of the
    high temperature in gas turbines. The new sensor offers turbine manufacturers
    and owners/operators the capability to place small-sized sensors in hard to reach
    areas in the turbine, and transmit sensed data wirelessly thereby enabling heat
    loads to be quantified. According to gas turbine engineers interviewed during
    National Science Foundation I-Corps program, increasing the firing temperature
    of a turbine by 100°C, due to accurate real-time temperature measurement, will
    result in 1% increase in efficiency. This translates to additional revenue of
    $48 million/year for a fleet of 100 turbines. In addition, these sensors can extend
    useful life by 10,000 - 25,000 hours per turbine due to enhanced maintenance planning,
    translating to an additional revenue of $76.7 Million ? $192 Million per turbine.
    In 2009, the United States Environmental Protection Agency established that emissions
    from fossil fuel-fired power plants, leads to negative effects on human health
    and the environment. The new wireless sensor will help to design more efficient
    gas turbines and improve operations of existing turbines thereby reducing harmful
    emissions from power turbines. \n\nThe intellectual merits of this project include:
    development of high-temperature sensing technology beyond its current stage; usage
    of newly developed materials (polymer-derived ceramics -PDC) for sensor applications;
    advancement of fundamental knowledge of process-property relationship of PDCs;
    improved sensor design and modeling; better understanding of sensor integration
    challenges and techniques for advanced sensing in gas turbine environment. The
    new wireless sensor is made of PDC. Advantages of PDC include high-temperature
    survivability, excellent oxidation/corrosion resistance, flexible manufacturing,
    and tunable electrical/mechanical properties. The sensor consists of a novel microstrip
    patch antenna for reliable wireless transmission of sensor data while keeping
    the overall volume of the sensor small so as not to distort gas flow profile in
    the turbine. High gain patch antenna will enable sensor to be interrogated at
    longer distances outside the turbine. The project objectives are: develop a wireless
    PDC sensor that can measure over 800°C to demonstrate high-temperature wireless
    sensing capability; demonstrate high-temperature wireless sensing beyond 50 cm;
    study sensor system implementation strategy in ultra-high temperature environment
    of a turbine engine; conduct preliminary investigation into sensor integration
    into existing turbine prognostic systems."

While significant advances have been made in developing strategies for the culture and differentiation of pluripotent stem cells, there is a critical gap in scaling these processes up to the number of cells required for clinical and research applications.  The specific focus of this project is the scale-up of beta islet cells for the treatment of diabetes. Diabetes currently affects 400 million people worldwide leading to 5 million deaths a year. There is currently no cure. A source of transplantable islet cells could alleviate many diabetic complications and restore the quality of life for millions of individuals.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to develop and test a novel wicking bioreactor and bioprocess for expansion of human pluripotent-derived beta islet cells. More specifically, this will require focusing on 3 major objectives:  i)Optimizing the cellulosic surface of the wicking matrix with chemical and extra cellular matrix additions to ensure attachment and proliferation of the islet cells; ii)optimizing controlled differentiation parameters such as oxygenation levels and feed rates to achieve a 10 fold increase in differentiated cells; and iii) develop a process using physical and biochemical means to remove the differentiated cells from the matrix while maintaining cellular integrity both in terms of viability and phenotype.  These studies will serve as proof-of-principle of the proposed bioreactor for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine applications.

    This SBIR Phase 1 project will create an educational technology that accelerates the acquisition of foundational English language skills by children (4 to 10 years old), by melding English and Spanish language instruction, delivered via a personalized digital learning platform. Using state-of-the-art text-to-speech and speech-to-text engines, students that are English Language Learners (ELL) will engage in deliberate literacy practice across the four modalities of language (listening, speaking, reading, writing). Over the last decade, the number of ELL students enrolling in public schools has steadily increased while there remains a shortage of bilingual or certified ELL teachers. Technology can help these teachers to personalize instruction and extend the school day which in turn increases engaged learning time. Achieving college and career readiness is an economic imperative for all students, especially ELL students given the importance of English communication skills to career success. While developing technologies for use in classrooms by young children can be a risky proposition due to the nature of the modern classroom, the reward far outweighs the risk. This project will produce a high-impact technology solution designed for young children that integrates the latest text-to-speech and speech-to-text technologies and is grounded in sound research about language skill acquisition across the four modalities.

    The key innovation of this SBIR Phase 1 project is a plurilinguistic (e.g., Spanish and English) approach to literacy development across the four modalities of language (e.g., reading, writing, speaking, listening) where young students (aged 4-10 years old) are immersed in personalized learning experiences specifically tailored to support and accelerate language development. The first research goal is to test the feasibility for using and adapting proprietary English and Spanish language text-to-speech and speech-to-text engines with young children. The second research goal is to examine the impact of a dual-language personalized learning platform on children?s acquisition of foundational listening, speaking, reading, and writing skills. Participants will be ELL students whose first language is Spanish. The research is based on a plurilinguistic framework for second language acquisition; researchers hypothesize that a dual-language application that leverages students' first language to learn English will score significantly higher on independent measures of foundational literacy skills and self-efficacy for learning compared to students who are using an English-only personalized learning application. A mechanism of growth may be the amount of time students are immersed in deliberate practice of literacy skills. A dual-language personalized learning platform has the potential to extend teacher-led literacy instruction and increase the amount of time students spend engaged in learning English.

    the high costs of developing effective and safe drugs.  Bringing a new drug to
    market typically involves screening 100?s of thousands of compounds for efficacy
    and toxicity utilizing cell, tissue and animal models to ultimately select a lead
    compound that will be tested in clinical trials.  This process can take years,
    billions of dollars, and in the worse case leads to compounds that fail during
    clinical trials due to safety concerns.  Advances in microfluidics and 3D-printing
    have enabled the construction of tissue culture devices with nearly unlimited
    numbers of tissue chambers and flow channel complexity.  Combined with optical
    sensors with unprecedented sensitivity, instrumentation can be built that maintain
    large numbers of biopsied tissue samples, while assessing the effects of exposure
    of the tissue to libraries of drugs.  This technological platform provides resolution
    of drug effects on human tissue with high sensitivity thereby reducing the cost
    of animal testing and the risk of bringing toxic drugs to clinical trials and
    the market.  In addition, the technology will impact the fields of personalized
    medicine, where drugs could be tested on an individual?s own tumor or tissue,
    and environmental health.  \n\nMeasuring in vitro cellular responses to pharmaceutical
    compounds is critical for identifying toxic effects of candidate drugs prior to
    costly in vivo animal and clinical testing. To address this need, instrumentation
    to maintain and assess biopsied tissue in real time is being developed.  The technology
    utilizes microfluidics for optimal maintenance of tissue viability and function,
    and optoelectronics to measure oxygen uptake with unprecedented sensitivity. The
    fluidics are driven by gas pressure, circumventing the need for unwieldy pumps,
    and the channels are fabricated by 3D printing, allowing for nearly unlimited
    numbers of chambers and flow channel complexity. The technological platform will
    aid in the selection of lead compounds for clinical trials, estimation of doses
    for first-in-human tests, and support applications to the FDA.  In this Phase
    1 SBIR proposal we will build 2 96-channel turnkey instruments for a contract
    research program and for beta testing by pharmaceutical companies. The functionality
    of a low-capacity (8-channel) system has been previously demonstrated.  The funding
    will support scaling up the throughput of the system as well as enabling additional
    modes of operation. The instrumentation will be used for contract research and
    for direct sales to the large market of drug discovery within the pharmaceutical
    industry."

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase I Project will productize a quantitative data processing
    technology in dynamic positron emission tomography (PET). Dynamic PET's distinction
    from its static counterpart is in the fact that it collects time-dependent tracer
    concentration data. It is a highly sensitive and accurate way of functional and
    molecular imaging of protein targets such as biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease,
    Parkinson's disease, or brain trauma. Unfortunately, dynamic PET is rarely used
    in clinic because of long imaging time and complex processing. The technology
    to be developed in this proposal will shorten the required imaging time and simplify
    the analysis, allowing for accurate and reliable imaging of disease biomarkers
    for aiding drug development, clinical diagnostics, and treatment monitoring. The
    proposed analytic workflow will be offered as a cloud-based service that can be
    used by the customers to analyze new or historical PET datasets. In order to overcome
    the established practice of relying on less accurate and informative static PET
    imaging, the grant recipients plan to conduct a thorough validation of the new
    technology using a dedicated physical phantom and human subject images acquired
    in the past. The largest impact of the new technology is expected in medical research
    and drug development. \n\nThe accepted practice of analyzing dynamic PET datasets
    involves reconstruction of the parameters of implied compartment model describing
    the tracer biochemistry, which involves several accuracy-degrading approximations
    and requires lengthy acquisition. The alternative approach proposed in this project
    relies on decomposing the dynamic PET image sequences using a combination of several
    processing techniques that incorporate the essential features of tracer pharmacokinetics
    without making explicit assumptions about the model parameters or about the underlying
    anatomy. The key part of the proposed methodology is factor analysis of dynamic
    structures, a non-negative matrix decomposition technique with successful past
    applications in radionuclide image analysis. The result of the workflow is a 3D
    concentration of tissues that exhibit specific-binding of the radiotracer. In
    order to validate the quantitative accuracy of the approach, the researchers will
    build and image a dedicated physical phantom capable of producing overlapping
    distributions with different tracer dynamics. In order to validate the scan-time
    reduction claims, the new workflow will be used to analyze existing dynamic PET
    human subject datasets using increasingly shorter input time windows.\n\nThis

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to create sustainable and biodegradable polyurethane products made from algae oils. Algae-based polymer precursors will be developed and used to produce finished polyurethane product with the desired physical characteristics. Development of polyurethane shoe soles will be targeted, including polyurethane flip-flops, as these are products where consumers are increasingly demanding the incorporation of sustainable materials and where the consumer is willing to pay the small extra cost associated with incorporating renewable materials. Developing algae polymers and high value products made from these will allow us to develop a novel monomer toolbox based on these bio-materials and to create new polymers with physical properties equal or superior to petroleum based polymers. These algae based polymers also provide cleaner, smarter products- pollution prevention at the molecular level. The development of environmentally sustainable and biodegradable products will reduce waste, prevent costly end-of-life remediation, lead to safer products and save energy and water resources. The development of these algae based polymer products will enable renewable materials to supplant petroleum-based materials while maintaining the performance characteristics of polyurethane products that consumers have come to appreciate.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop sustainable monomers from bio-based algae feedstocks that will be used to create finished polyurethane soft foams that have the appropriate properties for shoe soles. It incorporates the preparation of algae-based polyols from multiple algae oil sources, going from bench to production scale, followed by formulation of these monomers into materials that meet the demands of a discerning eco-conscious consumer. The developed algae polyols will not be formulaic direct drop-in replacements for the corresponding petroleum sourced materials' careful formulation will be required to generate polyurethanes with the desired final product properties, and that are also compatible with current manufacturing techniques. Formulation and process compatibility are key steps, as industrial users are not looking to significantly modify manufacturing processes to incorporate new starting materials. Lastly, physical evaluation of the resulting polyurethanes will be done by comparing the performance metrics between bio and petroleum-based polyurethanes typically used by end users in sportswear and automotives. Using polyols derived from multiple algal strains, a polyurethane formulation for soft foams will be developed to demonstrate our ability to integrate product development and manufacturing, from sustainable feedstock and green chemistry through commercial application.

    Transfer (STTR) project is the advancement of improved lithium ion batteries.
    The project will evaluate new battery chemistry enabling more rapid charging rates

    power density batteries would cater to a major emerging battery segment where
    current lithium ion battery technologies fall dramatically short. Successful development
    of this innovation will provide benefits to both current and future applications.
    Clearly, large scale deployment of a markedly superior energy storage device will
    have significant societal benefits by accelerating the move away from fossil fuel
    in many applications and products. For instance, a viable regenerative braking
    energy storage technology based on the proposed technology would result in a tremendous
    reduction in electricity used by subway trains, with a concomitant reduction of
    CO2 emissions. \n\nThis STTR Phase I project proposes to address the core of the
    microstructure - performance relations in energy storing materials, answering
    a series of fundamental questions regarding how a charge carrier is reversibly
    or irreversibly stored at high rates in manganese oxide - carbon nanocomposite
    anodes. In conventional LIBs, it is the graphite-based anode that limits charging
    rates, with catastrophic lithium metal plating and dendrite growth occurring at
    increased currents. It is expected that many of the existing \"Graphite - Inherited\"
    paradigms regarding fast rate in anodes would be done away with, or substantially
    redefined with the proposed approach for designing high power lithium ion batteries
    based on an inexpensive hemp-derived carbon nanosheets and nanostructured manganese
    oxide anodes. A much clearer understanding of the synthesis - structure - property
    relations in such nanocomposites will have wide-reaching scientific and technological
    implications. Research and development activities will focus on structural optimization
    and manufacturing scalability along with fabrication and testing of near-commercial

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project is to develop an external stent that can improve the quality and length of life for dialysis patients. Dialysis is the primary lifeline for End-Stage Renal Disease patients. Unfortunately, our current standard of care, which provides no additional support or treatment to the artery-vein connections surgically created in the arm to initiate dialysis (i.e. access sites), results in 40-60% failure rates within the first year. Consequences of these failures are dire: significant pain, suffering, and death for dialysis patients, hospital readmission penalties, and more than $1B in direct costs to Medicare. An external stent that wraps around the vein-artery/-graft junction of dialysis patients at the time of access site creation surgery has been developed to reduce these failures in a preventative fashion. In order to maximize the impact that it can have on the lives of dialysis patients by providing favorable flow conditions (i.e. hemodynamics) through the access site, it is imperative to first optimize device design on the bench with the aid of computational modeling. Findings from this grant will further scientific understanding of external supports and the role that hemodynamics play in access site failures.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to create a computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model that successfully predicts flow and deformation conditions at the access site in the presence or absence of an external stent, and to use this model to identify external stent design parameters that promote the most favorable hemodynamic environment for preventing access site failures. First, a 3D printing method of manufacture will be optimized to enable the fabrication of external stents in a highly-repeatable manner conducive to large-scale, FDA-compliant production. A CFD model will be created from empirical results in which surgically-constructed anastomoses (e.g. vein-graft junctions) are exposed to arteriovenous-mimetic pressure and flow conditions in the absence or presence of external stent designs. Empirical ex vivo data to validate the CFD model simulation results will be collected from quantitative measurements of dynamic deformation (e.g. magnitude of expansion) and flow patterns (i.e. velocity fields) in the presence or absence of various external stent designs via 4D flow MRI, which provides spatial and temporal information on 3D flow over the entire anastomosis. This work should result in the identification of a few designs that assert hemodynamic effects conducive to reducing neointimal hyperplasia, the primary culprit of access site failures.

    and disinfect surgical sites. The potential outcomes of the proposed activity
    are the development of a thin reusable blue light-emitting bandage that provides
    effective post-operative site disinfection, ultimately reducing nosocomial related
    infections. The proposed activity would further the development of antimicrobial
    blue light therapy devices, providing novel solutions to surgical site infections,
    Central Line Bloodstream Associated Infections, and wound infections, because
    of blue light therapy's proven ability to inactivate a wide range of clinical
    pathogens regardless of their resistance to antibiotics, ability to improve wound
    healing, and ability to inactivate bacteria in the biofilm state. The outcomes
    of this project will aid in providing a cost saving solution to Healthcare Associated
    Infections by reducing their occurrence, reducing the risks of human error, and
    improving accountability, quality and workflow. \n\nOptimization of blue light
    therapy is needed for clinical application for killing bacteria on the surface
    of patient's surgical sites, because of a radiant energy threshold that must be
    passed to inactivate bacteria. Due to the variation in devices and doses used
    in previous studies, combined with the clinical need for a device which can be

    is needed with a device designed as a wearable for clinical implementation.  Objective
    1: Determine optimal light dose (fluence) of blue light (405 nm) required to inactivate
    common gram positive and gram negative bacteria known to cause SSIs. Using in
    vitro techniques, determine the total fluence of light and treatment times required
    to achieve bacterial disinfection of at least a one log reduction in bacteria
    colony forming units.  Objective 2: Optimize device to deliver the effective irradiance
    while maintaining surface temperature below 43 Degree Celsius for safe use on
    tissue. The device is to not exceed 43 Degree Celsius on the surface of the device's
    therapeutic surface while delivering effective irradiance, from Objective 1, for
    inactivation of bacteria on surfaces.  Objective 3: Test the device's infection

    a porcine SSI model with surface-inoculated sutured incisions, made to the depth
    of the fascia, with optimized light-emitting antimicrobial bandage. Success criteria
    for bacterial disinfection is at least a 90% reduction of CFU per gram of tissue

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to develop an orthopedic device to quantify joint mobility. Millions of musculoskeletal injuries occur each year, which results in pain, swelling, and limitations in joint movement. Unfortunately, current joint mobility and ligament assessments are dependent on the clinician?s qualitative evaluation of the ?feel? of a joint, which often results in ineffective treatment. Failure to provide proper treatment delays restoration of motion, inhibits the return of prior function, and leads to lost wages and increased healthcare costs. The goal of this proposal is to develop a transformative device to quantitatively assess joint mobility of the shoulder, elbow, wrist, knee, and ankle. The aim is to take standardized clinical techniques currently performed in a qualitative manner to that of an objective and quantitative mode of assessment. Not only will this device be a first to market product, it will allow us to begin to develop the science of joint mobilization techniques. In addition, the device will accentuate the educational experience for emerging professionals via objective feedback to ?learn? to deliver consistent interventions to each patient. Thus, this device will capitalize on technology to enhance the practice of orthopedics.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a product to quantitatively measure joint movement. Currently, joint mobility and ligament assessments are performed qualitatively (i.e., clinician evaluates the ?feel? of a joint). However, treatments must be precise to enable the return of prior function. Inappropriate treatment can delay restoration of motion, inhibit the return of prior function, and lead to lost wages and increased healthcare costs. The goal of the proposed device is to enable accurate, simple, and inexpensive measurement of the magnitude of linear translation between two joint surfaces of multiple joints. In preliminary testing, we accurately measured millimeters of motion. We now propose to develop a compact, portable prototype that represents the ?best fit? contours for the shoulder, elbow, wrist, knee, and ankle. The use of attachable dovetail interfaces designed for each joint will allow the use of the same device on a variety of joints and permit the device to be interfaced between the patient?s joint and the clinician?s hand to enable the development of standardized protocols. An immediate display of the linear translation will appear via LED. This real-time feedback will impact clinical decision-making and support consistency of techniques for efficacious treatments.

    This SBIR Phase I project will develop an extended depth imaging variation of optical coherence tomography (OCT). OCT is an optical imaging method that can visualize tissue structures up to 1mm deep with microscopic resolution. It has been well adapted for retinal imaging but although available for skin imaging application, the performance and price point are not sufficient to encourage market adoption. Building on NSF supported research at Duke University, this project will extend the depth range of OCT from the current 1-2 mm, which is only the most superficial layer of skin, to 3-4 mm, enabling full imaging of skin layers down to the dermal junction. This will enable dermatologists to access OCT without a large financial outlay and provide a non-invasive imaging modality in the office setting.

    Extended depth imaging is also applicable to dental imaging and may allow dentists to reduce the need for X-ray imaging by providing cross sectional images of teeth and gums. Since these OCT instruments are highly portable, the deep imaging system can be widely used, across lab benches, in the field or shared throughout a medical office. This project will support the development of new products and the teams that design and build them. Extended depth imaging OCT uses a novel design to dramatically increase the depth penetration of OCT into skin, teeth and other samples. By using distinct illumination and collection apertures, extended depth (or dual axis) OCT can triangulate the signal to layers deep beneath the tissue surface. Compared to previous OCT systems, this increases the imaging depth by a factor of 2. This innovation will be combined with proprietary spectrometer design, which was developed to take advantage of 3D printing methods, to develop a disruptive new instrument for imaging with the performance and price necessary for commercial success in clinical dermatology and dentistry. This proposal will build a prototype system and test it on several types of animal tissue.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR)
    project is to improve outcomes and decrease costs in the mental health space by engaging
    patients starting with their first therapy session through objective progress reporting and
    post-session motivation. Patients and clinicians alike will be able to track and assess treatment
    progress through self-reported and physiological measures. This innovation builds upon the
    strong academic, government, and industry partnerships that will advance research and
    innovation in the field of biotechnology. By demonstrating improved outcomes and decreased
    costs associated with the utilization of technology, this will pave the way for insurance
    reimbursement (using existing CPT codes) to accelerate market adoption. Additionally, as
    education of patients and the public improves regarding mental health and PTSD in particular,
    the negative stigma surrounding these conditions will decrease and more people in need will
    seek help rather than resorting to unhealthy behavior or even suicide.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to represent an innovative approach that provides easy to
    interpret results tailored to mental health providers, patients, and other non-technical users.
    Current mental health treatment and assessment has lacked qualitative, scientifically-based
    measurement. The need for a scientific measurement is evident, as about 8 percent of all
    adults - 1 of 13 people in this country will develop PTSD during their lifetime. Currently, 60%
    of adults diagnosed with a mental illness don't receive mental health treatment; using proven
    science and physiologic measurements as the foundation for improving treatment and
    monitoring progress for PTSD can help to alleviate some of the stigma surrounding mental
    illnesses. This project aims to demonstrate how implementing a web-based platform can
    improve PTSD treatment by providing physiologically relevant feedback to the patient and by
    providing a tool for the clinician to tailor the therapy to the individual patient. Patients will have
    their subjective measures and physiological data visualized throughout treatment on a software
    platform, with progress being tracked through validated assessment scales. Patients will be
    compared to others in treatment as usual. Results should yield improved quality of life and
    decrease long term healthcare costs for those that use the platform.

    Research (SBIR) project entails alleviation of a human eye condition that has
    obscured the scientific community for almost a century. Refractive eye error is
    the most pervasive condition affecting the ocular health of the U.S. population,
    across all ethnicities. Presbyopia, a widespread form of such refractive error,
    affects 125 million Americans, and over 1.8 billion people worldwide today. It
    is caused by reduction of focusing and re-focusing ability of the human eye lens
    with natural aging. The symptoms range from blurred vision, haziness, and eye
    strain to headaches, which are sometimes severe enough to affect the quality of
    life and work ability of subjects. Since the early 1900s, presbyopia has been
    traditionally treated with fixed power multi-focal and progressive eyeglasses
    that do not solve the core problem of age-related loss of accommodative ability.
    The principal goal of this SBIR work is development of key high performance tunable
    Smart Eyeglasses with good stability and restoration algorithms that will help
    restore this lost ability. This 21st century device, the world?s first smart auto-focus
    eyewear, will offer personalized full field normal vision restoration to presbyopic
    subjects and generate jobs and revenues worth billions of dollars. \n\nThis SBIR
    Phase I project proposes to implement the feasibility of commercialization of
    21st Century variable power smart eyeglasses that will restore the natural accommodation
    of human eye that is lost to presbyopia due to aging. These adaptive glasses use
    a combination of fluidic lenses with variable power, ultra-light actuators, distance
    sensors, and embedded control electronics to continually produce full-field sharply
    focused view for objects at variable distances. For this proposal, we focus on
    the research and development of two important aspects of these devices which are
    key to a successful commercialization. First, is improving the long-term stability
    of the viscoelastic membranes of these adaptive glasses by using low drift materials
    instead of PDMS, and secondly, incorporating a closed-loop feedback mechanism
    using displacement sensors to account for the correction of drifts resulting from
    the hysteresis and degradation of lens-driving piezo actuators. In the first task,
    our goal is to achieve an optical power drift of less than 120 milli-Diopter/year,
    and in the second task, achieve a drift less than 83 milli-Diopter/year. These
    milestones will result in a lens with drift that is less than 0.25 Diopter over
    its expected 3 year lifetime, critical for a commercial grade eyewear lens.\n\nThis

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project extends from years of research into the impact of Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs), and yet there is still no direct, field assay for toxic cells. The identification of HABs is critical to determine their patterns of occurrence, to protect water and food supplies, and to alert the general public when there is a problem. Harmful Algal Blooms are a world-wide fresh water, brackish water and marine phenomena that occur in every coastal and inland country and annually cause significant economic damage and take human lives. The detection of HABs and their toxins is currently completed by complex, expensive, and time consuming microscopic analyses that do not necessarily provide the critical and timely information that water quality mangers require. Raman spectroscopy provides a strong and distinct fingerprint of HAB cells and their toxins without the need for sample preparation, and can be used on-site at beaches, drinking water reservoirs, or within distributed networks of Raman sensors all communicating through the cloud to provide managers immediate and spatially distinct information on the presence and concentration of potentially toxic cells.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to develop and market an in-situ 3D microscope with on-axis Raman spectroscopy to provide both morphological information and a chemical signature for identification of HAB cells to species, and in some cases specific strains, along with the presence and concentration of toxin on a per cell basis. The novel technical specifications include: 1) the use of Light Field (LF) microscopy to maximize the depth of field to allow for detection of low cell concentrations (< 1 cell/ mL). LF microscopy also provides a 3D image for more complete and accurate morphological assessment of cells and particulates, 2) Advanced software for color and texture feature extraction and classification of cells using Gabor wavelets and a novel color angle feature, which provide 100% classification accuracy in many cases, 3) the use of Resonance Micro-Raman Spectroscopy (RMRS) to collect spectral fingerprints on the inorganic and organic content of cells, particulates and dissolved compounds, and 4) the integration of these technologies into sensor packages as part of the IoT cloud computing thrust that is sure to gain traction over the next few years, and will provide regional protection of both large and small drinking water reservoirs, globally.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this STTR project stems
    from the costs to U.S. food producers of outbreaks of animal diseases.  Producers
    of poultry, pork, and other food proteins lose more than $1B each year to infectious
    diseases, including some that are transmitted through the air.  For diseases having
    an airborne transmission route, protective technologies that are available are
    few and can be costly to implement and operate.  This project furthers the development
    of a new alternative technology, non-thermal plasmas, for the simultaneous removal
    and inactivation in air of the organisms responsible for the transmission of disease
    to livestock.  This project evaluates how conditions in the environment typically
    found near livestock affect the performance of non-thermal plasmas.  This project
    also pursues a technique for accelerating the process of improving non-thermal
    plasma performance, upon the completion of which new and improved non-thermal
    plasma devices can be developed for applications such as this more rapidly than
    is possible now.  Completion of the project will enable the development of lower-cost
    protective technologies for maintaining livestock health, making such technologies
    economically accessible to a larger segment of food protein producers, ultimately
    lowering food costs and increasing domestic food security.  \n\nThis STTR Phase
    I project proposes to experimentally demonstrate and evaluate the effectiveness
    of a non-thermal plasma (NTP) as a means of preventing disease-carrying particles
    in outside air from infecting livestock housed in animal confinement buildings.
    \  NTPs are stable electrical discharges that simultaneously contribute to the
    removal of airborne particles while also subjecting them to chemical attack capable
    of killing harmful viruses.  While NTPs have been demonstrated for disinfection
    of fixed surfaces, and to a lesser degree for the destruction of chemical contaminants
    or biological pathogens in air, the intellectual merit of this project stems from
    its evaluation of trace gases commonly present in the air around livestock, ammonia
    and hydrogen sulfide, and their potential to both enhance and diminish the performance
    of NTPs used in farm environments.   Additionally, this project will identify
    non-biological tracers suitable for use in NTP optimization testing which will
    accelerate the development of improved designs.  Two separate lab-scale NTP reactors
    will be used in the execution of the project.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory

    The broader impact/commercialization potential of this project is to address the need for a small, low-cost, and high-accuracy angular rate and angular orientation sensor (also known as a gyroscope) for a wide range of applications.  Gyroscopes are desired by many emerging applications such as inertial measurement units for small satellites such as CubeSats, autonomous vehicles, drones, and high-end wearable electronics.  These applications require a gyroscope with a similar price (< $10) but ~10,000 times better accuracy than those currently used in smartphones.  The birdbath resonator gyroscope (BRG) is a novel micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) gyroscope with a strong potential to satisfy the needs of these applications due to significantly better resonance quality and mechanical symmetry than current silicon gyroscopes.  The economic impact of BRGs will be enormous since many industries can utilize high-performance gyroscopes to monitor the dynamics of their systems, provide positional awareness, and improve the performance of other parts of these systems.  Availability of low-cost and high-performance gyroscopes will enable users to further understand their applications and explore their limits and applicability across a broad range of societal needs.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a new batch-level microfabrication technology to enable the commercialization of low-cost, very high-performance MEMS gyroscope from fused-silica.  Gyroscopes available today are either accurate but large and expensive (example: hemispherical resonator gyroscope), or small and cheap but inaccurate (example: smartphone gyroscopes).  High-accuracy silicon MEMS gyroscopes in research are small and accurate but expensive.  This is because silicon has fundamentally low mechanical resonance quality factor (Q) so it is difficult to manufacture high-accuracy gyroscopes with a high yield.  The BRG is a gyroscope made from fused-silica and capable of having low cost, small size, and high performance.  Its fused silica micro mechanical resonator can achieve significantly higher Q than silicon, which allows the BRG to be manufactured with a high yield.  The BRG fabrication process uses a blowtorch to reflow-mold a fused silica substrate into three-dimensional hollow shells with dimensions of several 10s of micrometers to several millimeters with high geometrical accuracy.  The proposed research will significantly enhance our understanding of the relationships among size, design, and process on the performance of the BRG as well as the relationship among detailed process parameters, yield and reproducibility on cost.

    Broader Impacts: The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project include improving food security, while at the same time enhancing the economic viability and environmental sustainability of large-scale production agriculture. In order to improve crop varieties, agricultural production, and sustainability of farming, there is an urgent need for better technologies to acquire under-canopy plant trait and health data. Examples of high-value under-canopy data include emergence, stem width, corn ear height, plant life-cycle events like flowering and fruiting, and symptoms of pathogens, diseases, and nutrient deficiency. Because these data cannot be obtained by aerial imaging, under-canopy data collection has dramatically greater actionability and value compared to aerial data. However no cost-effective, scalable ways of collecting this data are currently available. In fact, the state of the art is manual data collection by crop scientists (and their students or interns), agronomists, crop-scouts or farmers - an extremely labor intensive, and therefore expensive way of collecting this highly valuable data. Our work will greatly enhance the availability of under-canopy data from field crops. The commercial value of the field data for crop breeding is in excess of $50 Million/year for breeding major row-crops in the US.

    Intellectual Merits: This SBIR Phase I project will demonstrate the technical feasibility of autonomously collecting under-canopy data from field crops using TerraSentia, our low-cost ground robot. In preliminary work, we have built the robot hardware, demonstrated its ability to collect high-value plant data from row-crop fields, and analyze it to generate plant-trait information. In the proposed work, we will enable and demonstrate the ability of TerraSentia to collect data autonomously throughout the season. We will demonstrate the technical feasibility of fusing information from low-cost LIDAR, GPS, and vision. We will also demonstrate the feasibility using real-time control algorithms to adapt camera perspective and robot path in order to obtain the highest quality information from the complex and dynamic under- canopy field environments. These high-risk innovations will together enable long-term deployment of TerraSentia for effective data collection and phenotyping, benefiting crop scientists and agricultural product development professionals.

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase I project will develop a very long-acting buprenorphine
    formulation to increase patient compliance and address the opioid crisis. Poor
    medication compliance is a significant driver of health care costs. The US would
    save an estimated 290 billion dollars yearly or 13% of the total health care budget
    if patients took their medications as directed. Patients with chronic diseases
    are the least compliant with medication. There is an evolving consensus that Opioid
    Misuse Disorder (OMD) is also a chronic disease, and its treatment is also plagued
    by poor compliance. There are an estimated 2.5 million people in the United States
    with OMD. Complete abstinence therapy fails about 80% of the time. Medication-assisted
    therapy using methadone, naltrexone or buprenorphine is far more successful. More
    opioid misuse patients are treated with buprenorphine than methadone, and retention
    in treatment is up to 78% with additional counseling. Still, 80% of all people
    who misuse opioids never obtain any therapy for their disorder, risking overdose,
    other diseases, including HIV and Hepatitis, and amyloidosis. Extended-release
    medications for opioid maintenance therapy would open up more options to get people
    into therapy. A 3-month release formulation of buprenorphine would be a part of
    that strategy.  \n\nBuprenorphine is a partial agonist opioid drug that is used
    for treatment of pain in human and animal patients and for opioid addiction maintenance.
    A platform technology has been developed that can be used to formulate extended-release
    preparations of drugs that are weak bases and are mildly lipophilic. Preparations
    of buprenorphine, naltrexone and doxycycline have been developed using this method.
    The initial proposed product is an injectable formulation of buprenorphine that
    releases over a period of 3 months. This project will address the occurrence of
    a brief peak of early drug release in the 3-month duration buprenorphine formulation.
    The experiments in the current proposal will examine three different methods of
    decreasing the early peak by manipulating the amount of lipid engulfed by macrophages
    at a given dose of drug or by preventing macrophage engulfment of the lipid particles
    entirely by coating the lipid particles with chemicals that make them unlikely
    to be phagocytized. Preliminary results indicate that changing the drug to lipid
    ratio as described in the current proposal will reduce the peak of early release.
    Reducing the early peak will prevent sedative effects, improve the pharmacokinetics
    of the preparation and make dose escalation studies easier and more straight forward.\n\nThis

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project scales the production of renewable monomers that give access to performance nylon polyamides with tailorable functional properties for applications in the automotive, food & beverage packaging, textiles, and other industries. The revolutionary technology will be a disruptive force to the $40 billion nylon polyamide industry by addressing nylon?s weaknesses such as undesired moisture adsorption, which results in loss of dimensional stability and tensile strength. These shortcomings lead industries to make compromises in selecting their materials; for instance, longer chain polyamides are used for moisture resistance but at the expense of desired viscoelastic properties. The proposed bio-advantaged monomers will 1) help ease reliance on petroleum-based chemicals resulting in greener production processes and a cleaner environment, 2) present new opportunities for innovation and use of performance plastics due to the platform that bio-advantaged monomers offer. This is expected to generate new jobs at multiple points in the value chain. Demand for agricultural goods by fermentation facilities will increase. Sumatra Biorenewables and its partners will create jobs to meet demand for monomer production and purification. Finally, polymer producers and the manufacturing industry will produce superior products, increasing the competitiveness of the U.S. chemical industry.

    The intellectual merit of this project is to combine fermentation and chemical conversion for the production of bio-advantaged monomers and their corresponding performance-enhanced polyamides. The inexpensive, robust, and efficient monomer production process in conjunction with the customizable nature of bio-advantaged monomers to yield nylon derivatives that are hydrophobic, flame retardant, anti-static, or otherwise tailorable, afford opportunities to meet a number of needs in the manufacturing sector. The innovation?s success hinges on a monomer production process that utilizes an inexpensive electrochemical conversion that operates near 100% efficiency and that only uses water as a reactant and electricity as an energy source. In addition, the monomer production process is insensitive to the feedstock source and the impurities present in fermentation broths. Therefore, separation and purification is only required after monomer production, resulting in huge cost savings. Laboratory-tested samples of hydrophobic nylon perform equally well as dry nylon, but without the disadvantage of moisture sensitivity. This project will enable Sumatra Biorenewables to transition to a continuous flow, kilogram-scale, production process and supply potential customers with samples for performance testing.

    Research (SBIR) project is the development of an artificial intelligence-based
    software platform to elucidate inherited diseases by identifying the causative
    genetic factors in the whole genome at large, not just the tiny portion of the
    genome called the exome. This technology will help solve the longstanding problems
    of multigenic inherited diseases and help unlock the full potential of gene therapy
    modalities such as CRISPR, which require knowledge of the causal mutation for
    targeting. With a defined genetic target, truly curative therapeutics and early,
    accurate diagnostics will be made possible. Through this platform, pharmaceutical
    companies will benefit from a shortened drug development cycle and a lower risk
    of clinical trial failure while diagnostics companies will be able to develop
    fast and accurate molecular diagnostics targeting the mutations identified by
    the platform. \n\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes to build a build a proof-of-concept
    software platform that employs a combination of supervised and unsupervised machine
    learning algorithms to process, sort, and analyze human whole genome sequencing
    data from an Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) cohort from a set genetic background.
    ALS is an incurable, debilitating disease whose genetic causes remain largely
    unknown. Identifying these mutations will enable the development of efficacious
    treatments for the conditions. Three main objectives will be accomplished for
    the platform. One, the ability to process full-size, high coverage human whole
    genome data automatically through the pipeline in a scalable manner. Two, the
    ability to identify the genetic background of a test subject with a top-5 error
    rate of <1%, an important verification step to minimize incorrect cohort stratification
    from false ancestry self-reports. Three, the ability to rapidly identify at least
    one genetic feature known to be associated with ALS (e.g., SOD1, C9ORF72), which
    will help provide early validation for the platform.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's

    on developing a  plasma jet printing technology to serve the printed electronics
    industry. Printed electronic devices including flexible electronics and flexible
    hybrid electronics (FHE) are next generation smart devices that have applications
    in both consumer and industrial segments. These devices combine the flexibility
    and low cost of printed substrates made of plastic with the performance of semiconductor
    devices to create a new category of electronics. The main challenge in FHE is
    integration of semiconductor die to the flexible substrate and interconnects.
    Plasma jet printing has high potential to address the problems associated with
    printed electronics manufacturing, in particular the interconnects. The plasma
    process control allows printing metallic materials with required electronic properties
    by in-situ treatment, thereby eliminating the need for post processing. The global
    market for printed electronics equipment is $1.5 billion in 2017 and is estimated
    to reach $4 billion globally in 2020 and growing at a compound annual growth rate
    of 38%. Immediate industrial application of our technology is in replacing wire
    bonding with direct write printing of metallic interconnects for flexible hybrid
    electronics. \n\n\nThe intellectual merit of this project is in developing a plasma
    jet print head hardware for direct write printing of conducting metallic interconnects
    with reduced process steps.  The project focus will be on technological de-risking
    of the print head hardware and process de-risking for reliable and re-producible
    printing. Developing the plasma process that can be used for pre-treatment of
    substrate, in-situ treatment of nanoparticles, printing and post processing all
    in one tool and simultaneously can reduce the process steps, number of equipments
    needed and time taken for manufacturing. Oxidation of metal nanoparticle ink and
    its limited shelf life is currently being addressed by polymer capping of the
    nanoparticles and thermal/laser processing. Developing a plasma process that can
    be used to print high quality conducting patterns using in-situ treatment can
    take the technology closer to adoption by printed electronics industry. The anticipated
    outcome of this project is a robust plasma jet print head and a process that can
    reliably and reproducibly print conducting metal films with tailored oxidation

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is a system that provides improved reservoir productivity through a novel, inexpensive, and environmentally friendly method. This method will use an electric impulse to increase reservoir permeability, and decrease industry reliance on alternative methods like hydraulic fracturing, which requires hazardous chemicals to be pumped into the subsurface. Residents in regions where fracking techniques are utilized have commonly been impacted by induced seismicity and landslides as a consequence of pumped in chemicals lubricating faults, making earth ruptures more likely to occur. Additionally, the material and operation time for reservoir stimulation techniques makes the current process expensive. The ability to increase permeability with an electric impulse will avoid the environmental concerns associated with current methods, and will proved a cost competitive reservoir stimulation solution due to a short operational time.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a novel low-frequency impulse method (LFIM) that increases reservoir permeability for petroleum and geothermal applications, without requiring pumping of material into the subsurface. Fluid mobility is increased due to viscosity reduction and reservoir permeability is increased in the direction of interest from the vibrational removal of particles within sediment pores.  This program will 1) simulate the processes taking place in the reservoir using computer simulation model, 2) perform experimental analysis of the effects of the electric treatment on different core samples, and 3) determine applicability of the method to different types of the reservoirs located in the United States.  Therefore, this project will identify the optimum sites, where LFIM can boost geothermal performance and oil & gas production.

    This SBIR Phase I project takes a deeper look at the concept of 'purpose' and its relationship to the marketplace, unemployment, and start-up incubators. It intends to develop a multi-question self-assessment tool to help individuals find meaningful purpose through free, online, live and self-paced hybrid course instruction. The coursework will use augmented reality and 3-D video to motivate individuals to re-think purpose as a central motivation to employment and entrepreneurship. This project aligns with the NSF?s mission to advance national health, prosperity, and welfare with science and technology. These outcomes could potentially generate a new generation of business owners that are dedicated to meaning and money through a double bottom-line approach to entrepreneurship.

    This project combines the educational work of finding purpose through self- help and the technology of 3-D video and augmented reality for the first time. This unique project provides free online live synchronous education combined with hybrid self-paced online course work to help individuals find meaningful self-employment solutions. This project utilizes a proprietary training method designed to quickly help individuals find their purpose in life and invent a useful business or nonprofit to solve problems in the world. This research can help students re-center their motivations to chart a meaningful life course through a business or nonprofit start-up. The curriculum starts with this activity and extends to provide students an opportunity to enter the marketplace through micro-enterprise or nonprofit creation. The courses will utilize predictive analytics to synthesize student data (such as the answers each student inputs for the four questions in the purpose activity). The data will be reorganized and automated into a clear and targeted purpose proposition statement for the student.

    the commercial viability of using new non-precious metal catalysts to produce
    hydrogen by splitting water.  Electrolyzers made with these new catalysts have
    the potential to deliver higher efficiencies and lower capital costs than currently
    available systems. The market for hydrogen today is $115 billion per year.  Currently,
    hydrogen is primarily produced via steam reformation of methane. Hydrogen production
    via steam reformation emits millions of tons of CO2 into the atmosphere annually.
    There is broad agreement that water electrolysis can play a significant role in
    future hydrogen production if cost reductions can be realized.  In addition, hydrogen
    has the potential to store energy produced by renewable energy systems like solar
    and wind and make it available on demand. The initial market entry point for these
    new electrolyzers is to supply hydrogen for fuel cell powered forklifts used in
    material handling. A life cycle cost analysis by the National Renewable Energy
    Laboratory (NREL) has shown that the total life cycle costs of hydrogen fuel cell
    forklifts are 10% cheaper than those using lead acid batteries. \n\nThe intellectual
    merit of this project is focused on the ability of new earth-abundant non-precious
    metal catalysts for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution
    reaction (OER) to dramatically lower costs while improving efficiency in water
    splitting. The HER electrocatalyst is composed of hyper-thin FeS2 nano-discs and
    the OER electrocatalyst is nanoamorphous Ni0.8:Fe0.2 oxide. The preferred operating
    pH for the catalysts are different (pH 7 for the hyper-thin FeS2 nano-discs and
    pH 14 for the nanoamorphous Ni0.8:Fe0.2 oxide). Preliminary data shows that these
    two catalysts with the dual-pH membrane can effectively split water with a total
    overpotential of only 300 mV (1.53 V in a two electrode configuration). This is
    more than 50 mV lower than the best-known precious metal catalysts, Pt and IrOx,
    used in current commercial electrolyzers. The project will continue the optimization
    of these catalysts in the dual-pH electrolyzer stack and also determine if stability
    and lifetime meet commercial requirements\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is the reuse of rubber compounds from spent tires in high performance products including new tires without significant loss in product performance. Only a very small portion of those tires are currently being ground up for this purpose because of the detrimental impact  on product properties. However, larger quantities could potentially be used if the ground rubber is treated by the process of our invention. This would have several benefits.  Manufacturers could reduce material cost, the rubber recycling industry would enjoy significant growth and unsightly tire dumps with associated pollution problems would disappear. Additionally, the tire industry will become more sustainable and other unacceptable uses of old tires currently practiced, such as their use as fuels in low cost operations, would be financially challenged as novel, more profitable uses that retain the integrity of the polymer matrix emerge.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to build upon studies conducted by our company during the last few years. While it was widely known that recycled ground rubber will significantly reduce physical properties, limited information and understanding existed on the basic causes. Much hope was pinned by many companies and academic institutions on the potential merit of the ground up rubber but no significant commercial process previously emerged. This work aims to develop a recycling process which does not require a devulcanization step. This was first demonstrated with model sample geometries that simulate the environment which ground rubber particles experience when added to and being co-vulcanized with fresh rubber compounds.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I is the improvement of public transportation services for people with disabilities, specifically people with visual impairments. Individuals with visual impairments are heavily dependent on public transit as an essential service for engaging in daily life and social activities. However, they often face challenges with (1) determining which bus to board, especially at busy bus stops when multiple buses approach, and (2) boarding the correct bus in a timely fashion before they leave the stop. By developing an advanced notification service for alerting bus drivers, SeeingBus will address the societal and market needs to mitigate these challenges and thereby promote independent use of public transportation among people with visual impairments. Improving accessibility of public transportation to people with disabilities along with enhancing perception of their service will boost ridership resulting in increased revenue for agencies. The project will contribute to the scientific community as well as society in general by advancing understanding of Smart City services needed for independent travel of people with disabilities.

    The proposed project will develop and commercialize a Smart City service to improve public transportation for people with visual impairments. The service, SeeingBus, provides an advanced notification to bus drivers about users waiting at their next stop. People with visual impairments often miss buses due to challenges they face with boarding the correct bus. SeeingBus aims to improve accessibility of public transportation by engaging bus drivers even before the bus arrives at the stop where riders with visual impairments are waiting. As part of the smart city vision, SeeingBus will enhance connectivity of public transportation systems through greater communication between riders, bus stops, and bus drivers by means of smart sensors. Using big data, SeeingBus alerts bus drivers about users with disabilities, so the drivers can assist individuals in boarding the bus safely. The research objective of this project is to develop and test the feasibility of the SeeingBus system. Advancing public transportation, essential to promoting the travel and independence of individuals, aligns with the NSF mission to advance prosperity and welfare through scientific advancements.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to enable accurate electronic health record (EHR)-based studies to support precision medicine. The country is embarking on a journey of using real world evidence (RWE) to adjust the existing standard of care. EHR-based subgroup analytics and comparative effectiveness studies will increasingly be used to augment regulatory and reimbursement approval. These efforts require accurately recognizing clinical outcomes in real world scenarios. Studies attempting to identify real world outcomes, such as pain and disease free survival, have shown low accuracy rates in claims and EHR discrete data. This proposal aims to accurately detect challenging outcomes from EHR data using advanced semantic technologies. The goal is to enable accurate RWE studies to achieve safer and more effective use of RWE in clinical practice.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to create an application to extract clinical outcomes from real world data to enable EHR-based pragmatic clinical trials (PCTs). The approach uses natural language processing (NLP) to dive deep into the health record for exposure, intervention, and outcome data that do not exist or are inaccurate in claims and EHR discrete data. Project objectives include extracting features from clinical data using NLP and ontologic mapping, developing a knowledge database that reflects common outcomes in observational and clinical trials, and inferring outcome from extracted features using clinical data. The project will validate the outcome detection engine using de-identified longitudinal clinical data to assess accuracy of feature extraction and inferred outcome.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research
    (SBIR) project is significant as it offers a disruptive new mechanical approach to stroke
    treatment. Each year, 795,000 strokes occur in the U.S., 1.7 million strokes in Europe, and
    nearly 20.5 million strokes worldwide. This public-private partnership is expected to have an
    important positive societal impact on the community by saving lives especially the elderly and
    decreasing the economic burden of stroke on the taxpayer. This life-saving device has a unique
    value proposition for health-systems with lower inventory costs from a single size device, and
    for patients with better vessel re-opening rates, thereby saving brain cells. This textile-based
    braided retrievable stent, also known as an embolus retriever or thrombectomy-assist device is
    an innovation that will enhance scientific and technological understanding of how personalized
    medicine can transform the care of stroke patients in the U.S. and worldwide.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to bring to market the industry?s longest blood clot
    or embolus retriever for removal of short and long clots that can be customized by the operator
    based on each patient?s clot burden. In addition, it is the first textile-based braided retrievable
    stent which works well in conjunction with standard catheter-based aspiration systems for stroke
    treatment developed in the U.S. that can be personalized to all clot lengths. Stroke is a major
    problem causing 5.5 million deaths worldwide and currently there is no cost-effective and
    efficacious treatments. The mean lifetime healthcare cost per stroke patient is $140,048. This
    textile-based clot retrieval device (aka thrombectomy-assist device) is a cost-effective medical
    device that can help save a stroke patient?s life. The methods and approaches of this project is
    to compare via pre-clinical tests the ability of a textile-based medical device to re-open vessels
    blocked with clots compared with existing approved treatments. The goals and scope of the
    research will focus on the ability to rapidly re-open vessels that are blocked by clots. This paves
    the way for personalized medicine with a customizable stroke treatment device that can be
    tailored to a patient?s clot burden.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop customizable cell/tissue culture platforms using a new class of 3D printable bisphenol A-free polycarbonate (BFP) materials and a rapid 3D printing system. The 3D cell culture market was valued at $683 million in 2017 with an exponential projected growth in revenue valued at $1.7 billion by 2022. The rapid growth in this sector is primarily driven by the demand for custom-made 3D cell/tissue models that more accurately recapitulate the human in vivo biology in comparison to conventional animal models and planar cell culture systems. 3D cell/tissue models have the potential to provide more physiologically relevant responses for the drug discovery industry which is estimated to reach $86 billion in 2022. The proposed strategy of using BFP and a fully integrated benchtop 3D printing system will facilitate the production of different cell/tissue culture platforms on demand and enable rapid iteration of different designs to drive forward the development of more clinically relevant cell/tissue models for a broad market in pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, and biological studies.

    The intellectual merit of this project lies in: (1) the development of novel 3D printable BFP materials with tunable material properties using green chemistry, and (2) the rapid 3D printing of customizable cell/tissue culture prototypes to support various 3D cell/tissue models. The material development will include the establishment of a reagent library and optimization of the green chemistry process. The relevant material properties such as stiffness, elasticity, optical transparency, and small molecule adsorption will be characterized and optimized. These materials will then be printed using a rapid light-based 3D printer to prototype cell/tissue culture platforms followed by evaluation of their performance. In particular, 3D printing precision and resolution will be characterized and optimized by varying a range of fabrication parameters such as light exposure time and intensity. Next, the efficacy of the prototypes under cell culture conditions will be assessed based on device integrity, material degradation, as well as changes in mechanical and optical properties. Various cells/tissues will also be cultured on these prototype devices to evaluate biocompatibility. These achievements will provide customized culture platforms to facilitate the engineering of more physiologically relevant in vitro models for accelerating drug discovery and biological studies in both industry and academia.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is the commercialization of a fermentation bioprocess that can bring significant benefits for the dairy industry - called the WheyAway system. By initially addressing the problem of handling acid whey, a waste stream generated by all Greek yogurt and cottage cheese producers - the WheyAway can convert the cost of waste handling into a revenue by producing valuable bio-oil platform chemicals. The WheyAway can economically convert the acid whey waste stream to bio-oil on-site, allowing our customers to effectively install biorefineries at each of their plants. In comparison to anaerobic digestion, the WheyAway system can provide several multiples greater economic value. These bio-oils can be used as biofuel feedstocks, animal feed additives, and specialty chemicals. Converting acid whey yields a significant market opportunity with projected impact that could simultaneously offset ~435,000 gallons of diesel used to truck this waste off-site and eliminate ~18,000 tons of greenhouse gases from being emitted to the atmosphere. In the future, this bioprocess can be tuned to address other dairy processing streams, allowing the WheyAway to provide value to stakeholders across the entire dairy production value chain.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to scale-up and optimize a novel fermentation bioprocess called the WheyAway system, and can economically convert acid whey waste into valuable platform chemicals, to provide value to Greek yogurt and cottage cheese producers. Plan is to scale to maximize bio-oil production and conversion efficiency through system optimization. A key focus will be to lower the capital cost for the extraction process. Through the tasks proposed for this SBIR, objectives to scale to a 5x larger reactor, lower operating expense by 20%, and lower the capital cost of the currently expensive bio-oil extraction process by 10x. Additionally, potential to convert other dairy process streams, such as sweet whey, will be evaluated, which could unlock larger opportunities in the dairy production value chain.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    This SBIR Phase I project will develop text, speech and image analysis technologies to transform a set of educational lecture videos into an interactive learning companion. A lecture video will be presented as a series of topically cohesive sections, each represented by a textual summary, a visual summary, and a video segment. Students will be able to query a series of lecture videos with the answers presented as a combination of text, images, speech with transcript, and video, along with links to additional relevant resources. These technological enhancements will drive the development of the lecture video management system with capabilities well beyond commercial state of the art. The students will gain the ability to instantly access any information in a semester long course, with little overhead for the instructor. The business plan focuses on a freemium model designed for wide adoption with no cost to instructors and a very low cost to students. The ultimate potential societal benefit is a significantly better learning experience and learning outcomes for higher education students.


    The key innovations in this project are summarization of video segments and a Questions & Answers (QA) system customized for a series of lecture videos. These are formidable challenges despite existing substantial related research in text mining and image analysis. The information content of a lecture video spans multiple modalities, specifically, screen text, images, and speech. Further, each modality has unique characteristics. Screen text is typically unstructured and includes Optical Character Recognition errors. Transcripts from classroom lecture videos contain informal classroom interactions and suffer from speech recognition errors. The images in a lecture video can represent a variety of concepts including illustrative examples, graphs and charts, and camera images. Innovative approaches to topic modeling will be developed to handle the unique nature of the input compared to most documents. The project will employ representation learning approaches to map from each modality to a common semantic space that will drive the matching between student questions and the content of lecture videos. Since the best answer to a student question may not be fully contained in a lecture video, external resources including textbooks, message boards, and actual quizzes and exams will also be analyzed to drive the QA module.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to dramatically reduce the incidence of natural gas pipeline failures across the country, within the next 3 to 5 years. Every year there are a few hundred "significant" pipeline accidents (fatalities or significant property damage) causing massive damage to life and property, dispersing hazardous materials and disrupting gas distribution services. These events result in many hundreds of millions of dollars in repair and recovery, and large fines that can be up to a billion dollars or more. This scalable and economical capability will significantly reduce the likelihood of such failures, without requiring additional infrastructure. Performance has been validated at a large utility company, and the prototype has demonstrated the ability to capture a substantial fraction of previously undetected events with significant advance warning (90 minutes or more). This outcome represents a clear performance improvement over existing systems and is enabled by advanced models customized for the gas-utility domain. The methods developed in this project can be directly applied to improve detection accuracy in other contexts such as power-grid networks, computer cluster management and financial fraud detection.

     This SBIR Phase I project proposes to detect anomalies in large-scale gas-utility networks through statistical inference from continuously observed time-series data on pressure, prevailing temperature, and other characteristics of the network. Anomalies within gas-utility networks occur due to a variety of reasons, e.g., sulphur or ice buildup in the pipelines, and corrosion/aging of hardware, and are often preceded by detectable signatures in the time-series of gas-pressure data. A premise of the project is that the early detection of such signatures, leading to advance warning of 90 minutes or more, allows corrective action within the utility network to avoid significant property damage, loss of life, and service disruption. The project proposes new methods for the rapid estimation of short and medium timescale models of gas pressure behavior from voluminous streaming data, along with methods for constructing prediction bands through Monte Carlo and stochastic optimization techniques. Such methods are non-generic and their success relies crucially on exploiting specific structural properties that are unique to network-level gas-pressure time series, along with modern trends in statistical machine learning. The proposed stochastic optimization techniques will probabilistically classify identified anomalies into ``failure type," allowing the prioritizing of network level emergency operations.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is that it holds the promise of significantly reducing the over fertilization of crop fields with poultry litter and at the same time provide poultry farmers with greater profits.  Currently poultry litter (excrement, feathers, bedding and other waste) is used as fertilizer on crop fields. The litter is excessively high in phosphorous which is not well adsorbed by crops and ends up in waterways causing excessive algae growth resulting in dead zones with no aquatic life.  This project expects to prove the practicality of a high efficiency burn system that is low enough in cost to be affordable by individual farmers. The system will burn poultry litter and convert the resulting heat energy to electricity and hot water for heating the farmer's chicken houses. The energy savings will increase farmer's net profits (including the amortized cost of the system) by, on average, 25%.  Thus poultry farmers will be incentivized to eliminate environmentally dangerous poultry litter by converting their farm waste to energy.


    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to design, produce and test a scaled prototype version of the lab test system.  The lab test system is expected to provide burn efficiencies as high as ~97% with particulate emissions well within EPA standards. The scaled system will be designed to process ten times the litter as the lab system.  The primary question this SBIR project will answer is: can the lab results be replicated in a full scale system capable of handling the requirements of an average poultry farm.  The patent pending technology upon which the lab system was designed uses computer controlled fuel (poultry litter) feed rates coupled with a multilevel air injection system to produce optimal efficiency. There are several variables that will be tested to ensure upscaling the size will be successful. These include combustion chamber size and design, air injection locations, pressures and CFM, and fuel feed rates.  Successful commercialization will require optimization of these variables in a full scale system.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) project is to develop a protein replacement for soy-based marine
    animal diets to improve yield through effective nutrition and enhanced animal
    welfare. Aquafeeds represent >50% of the cost of production, and losses due to
    mortality can be as high as 50% in certain commercial species. A novel feed ingredient
    that contains immuno-nutritional properties to address these inefficiencies could
    be considered a game-changer to the industry. Fish are the most resource-efficient
    sources of animal protein, a healthy source of food for people, and will be one
    of the ways to address food security. As the surface of the planet is greater
    than two-thirds ocean, one estimate suggests, if managed properly, just 2% of
    this vast resource could produce enough food for all of mankind. \n\nThis SBIR
    Phase I project proposes to expand previous studies that suggested a novel single
    cell protein (SCP) is a significant candidate to serve as a fishmeal alternative.
    In addition, SCP also may contain functional properties that improve growth performance
    and survival. The SCP tested previously supported improved feed conversion ratios
    (FCR) as compared to conventional diets, while at the same time, statistically
    relevant improvements in survival of carnivorous fish and shrimp.  It also was
    observed that SCP relieved secondary disease complications associated with diets,
    such as gastro-enteritis. With hundreds of marketable species in aquaculture,
    and an industry that is just 50 years old, the collective understanding of aquatic
    animal nutrition is in its infancy. In this project, a carnivorous Seriola species
    will be used as a model organism to serve as an additional reference point beyond
    salmon. Targeted components of the SCP will be enhanced (or deleted) to determine
    the effect of leading immuno-nutritional candidates on the animals' ability to
    digest more completely inputs like soy bean meal (SBM). The effectiveness of SCPs
    in emerging commercial fish diets has yet to be fully elucidated, and the results
    of this study may have implications towards lower-cost feed formulations and optimized
    nutrition.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to further the development of a patent pending technology aimed at producing flexible, lightweight, and low-cost semiconductor substrates. These flexible semiconductor films represent the next evolution of the silicon wafer, the foundation of over 90% of today's electronic devices, including computer chips, solar panels, microelectronics, and a wide range of sensors and similar 'internet of things' devices. The silicon wafer, in its current form, is essentially unchanged since its inception over 60 years ago. These wafers, although larger today, remain thick, rigid, fragile, and are limited to circular forms no larger than 450 millimeters (18 inches) in diameter. The ability to produce large-area, high-throughput quantities of this material, in a flexible, more durable format would be truly disruptive, and help to usher in the next generation of affordable, flexible, and pervasive electronic devices. Accelerating the commercialization of this 'wafer 2.0' will help to shape America's high-tech semiconductor manufacturing industry for the 21st century.

    The proposed project will focus on the development of this innovative technology at a simulated roll-to-roll prototyping scale, to enhance film crystal quality, repeatability, and electronic properties, while preparing the process for integration into large scale manufacturing. To date, no techniques exist that can produce large-area, highly crystalline silicon or other semiconductor films, that are suitable for high-throughput manufacturing. The technique in this proposed work is a novel, patent pending process, suitable for high-throughput roll-to-roll manufacturing and has several technical advantages that favor high-uniformity crystallization. Low-cost, flexible, wafer-like substrates will open the door for a wide range of electronic devices and fully integrated system-on-chip designs, including sensors, displays, lighting, processors, memory, microelectronics, and photovoltaics. Specific research activities will include optimization of the crystallization process via exploration of operating parameters; improvements and refinements to the prototype chamber equipment; evaluation of intermediate thin-film layers to provide ideal electronic properties and to promote more favorable recrystallization; and, finally, characterization of the resulting semiconductor films using state of the art semiconductor tools at the world's largest nanotechnology focused institute.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes increased range, increased efficiency, and decreased size of wireless charging systems, which will provide value to consumer devices (e.g., mobile phones and tablets), transportation, and medical industries. In consumer devices, improved and widely adopted wireless power transfer can lead to more rugged designs of the devices by eliminating charging ports, which are a common mode of device failure. Widely adopted wireless charging can improve convenience for consumers, and, with a unified charging solution across a number of devices, eliminate the need for dedicated, device-specific chargers. Increased charging range will increase the number of use cases in all three industries, leading to greater commercial opportunities for this this technology and wireless power transfer in general. In transportation, high-efficiency wireless charging allows for fast charging that is adaptable to varying vehicle heights, which makes electric vehicles more convenient, increases their rate of adoption, and allows charging that is integrated into infrastructure. Increased efficiency reduces the energy costs associated with charging across all three industries.  Furthermore, this project will enhance the scientific understanding of the power handling capabilities of the multilayer self-resonant structure, and the resonant frequencies achievable with various manufacturing techniques.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project addresses the technical challenges keeping a new wireless power transfer coil technology, called the multilayer self-resonant structure (MSRS), from the market.  In order to commercialize the MSRS, the technology must advance beyond a proof-of-concept, and interface with commercial wireless power transfer systems, specifically those that adhere to existing device standards.  The technical hurdles that need to be addressed include 1) reducing the resonant frequency to meet current standards, 2) understanding the power handling limits, and 3) developing electronic interfaces.  These challenges will be overcome by, respectively,  1) building on existing manufacturing techniques used to handle thin layers of material in other industries and adapting them to  develop a scalable manufacturing approach to construct MSRSs with resonant frequencies in the range needed. 2) Analyzing, measuring, and modeling the power handling capabilities of the MSRS.  Finally, 3) Developing impedance matching circuitry required to interface the MSRS with commercial systems. Successful completion of these task will results in a low cost, high-Q wireless power transfer coil, which can be integrated into commercial systems to increase the capable range, efficiency, and power handling of wireless charging.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be the establishment of the analytical framework and software for a global bathymetry mapping system based upon freely available satellite imagery, three independent extraction methods, and ongoing data collection to create geospatial products for a wide range of applications.? Shallow water zones are crucial to the world?s ecology, economy, and culture.  An estimated 70% of the world?s littoral zone is not mapped to modern standards, and traditional methods of mapping these areas are prohibitively expensive and dangerous. Through remote sensing techniques, this innovation will produce detailed bathymetric data for shallow water areas around the globe at far lower costs than traditional methods. This is particularly significant for impoverished remote, low-lying islands which have scarce resources for mapping the natural environment on which their economies heavily rely. ?Additionally, shallow water bathymetry data is vital to geospatial intelligence and to accurately assessing the feasibility and environmental impact of projects relating to global trade/port development, aquaculture, tourism, and resource development.? The results of this innovation will provide a modern baseline of seabed topography for future scientific analysis, change detection, and greater understanding of the marine environment.

    The proposed project addresses the budgetary and health and safety challenges of nearshore bathymetry mapping by advancing three distinct methods of calculating satellite derived bathymetry. These methods rely on different parameters of measurement for water depth retrieval, enabling the advantages of one method to overcome the shortcomings of another. This will create a self-validating method for leveraging advanced remote sensing algorithms in an integrated software platform with ongoing data collection to produce 10-30m resolution bathymetry elevation models.? Extraction methods utilize underwater stereophotogrammetry from multiple overlapping images, wave kinematic detection from multispectral imagery, and measurement of variable attenuation of multispectral signals through the water column.? Research will be conducted on computer vision applications for assessing and allocating images based upon metocean and atmospheric parameters; seafloor spectral segmentation techniques and effects on subsequent multispectral depth retrieval; automation of stereophotogrammetric seafloor target identification and correlation, and integration and automation of wave kinematic derived depth values with multispectral depth retrieval values.? Statistical analysis of resulting data from this combined processing method, evaluated against in situ data for trial locations, will provide direct comparisons for accuracy reporting, algorithm refinements, computational optimization, and determine overall technical and commercial feasibility of future global implementation.?

    is an electrochemical water treatment technology which has the potential for minimizing

    \ About 80M U.S. homeowners are seeking a water purification solution for fear
    of their water quality. They are unsatisfied with the high maintenance, long-term
    costs, and lack of comprehensive treatment capabilities of existing systems. \n\nThis

    water purification systems are largely ineffective in comprehensively treating
    contaminants such as pathogens, toxic organics, and metals, and also require frequent
    maintenance which contributes to high costs and waste generation. To address these
    concerns, the treatment effectiveness, cost, and feasibility of treating water

    the quality of life of patients currently suffering from Parkinson?s Disease (PD).
    \ Over 1 million Americans have been diagnosed with PD and this number is expected
    to double by 2040.  PD is a neurodegenerative disorder without a cure ? once the
    first Parkinsonian tremor has been detected, over 80% of the brain cells associated
    with creating dopamine through natural processes have already died. Dopamine is
    a chemical released by neurons to communicate with other nerve cells and is essential
    to enable the basal ganglia network to control the body?s movements. By engaging
    the PD patient with novel, highly-cognitive mobility exercises designed by physical
    therapists (PTs), automaticity can be reprogrammed to utilize different regions
    of the brain to control movement. Ultimately, this rewiring will slow (neuroprotection)
    or possibly reverse the degenerative process.  Although the current technology
    development will focus on this one disease (PD), the technology may be applicable
    to other sister diseases (e.g., Alzheimer?s and Dementia) or even other conditions
    (traumatic brain injury, stroke, concussions, and so on). This computer-adaptive
    platform may eventually enable researchers to identify a biomarker that may lead
    to a cure for this idiopathic condition. \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research

    (PT) treatment for patients suffering from Parkinson?s Disease (PD). This automated
    prototype will act as a virtual coach encouraging patients to perform daily mobility
    exercises in the comfort and privacy of their own homes. This unique, automated
    technology will help rewire the brain of the PD patient by engaging both the mind
    and body which will slow the neurodegeneration inherent to PD. The system will
    automatically adjust the treatment protocol in terms of duration and difficulty
    based on the patient?s unique situation including current medication levels. Objective,
    technology-based outcome measures will be summarized for caregivers working with
    the PD patient (primary care provider, physical therapists, neurologists, and
    so on).  In addition, this technology platform will be designed to enable community
    interaction among PD patients as well as facilitate tele-health communications
    between the PD patient and his/her healthcare provider.  The overall objective
    is to develop a PD-specific electronic system that directs PT treatment by developing
    hardware/software to test the feasibility of the adaptive assessment and the automated
    PT treatment system.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is through providing a sensitive, robust, room temperature operating magnetometer.  Magnetometers are among the most widely used instruments in a variety of applications including healthcare, transportation safety, food contamination monitoring, and homeland security. In fact, the growing need for magnetic field sensors manifests itself in the $1.6 billion global market with a fast-growing medical segment. As for today, the maximum sensitivity is provided by the Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices. The high sensitivity is critically important for medical applications.  However, this high sensitivity can be achieved in the superconducting devices only at cryogenic temperatures.  The proposed magnetometer based on spin wave interferometer combines high sensitivity with room temperature operation. This combination provides a great improvement in healthcare by reducing the cost of equipment, in transportation safety enhancement by providing more accurate traffic control, and in food safety monitoring by detecting small concentrations of heavy metals.  It will be of great benefit to society to have a magnetometer combining the high sensitivity of superconducting devices and room temperature operation.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the need for sensitive and room temperature operating magnetic field sensors by providing a magnetometer based on spin wave interferometer.  There are different types of magnetic sensors available on the market. As of today, the maximum sensitivity up to attoTesla is provided by the Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices. However, this high sensitivity can be achieved only at cryogenic temperatures. The latter makes superconducting magnetometers expensive and limits its practical application. The proposed magnetometer is based on spin wave interference and free of constraints inherent in superconducting devices. The research objectives encompass the development and demonstration of a compact, non-expensive magnetometer with up to attoTesla sensitivity operating in a temperature range from cryogenic to 560 K.  The outcomes of the proposed research will have an impact on commercial, defense and homeland security applications that need increasingly precise and robust magnetic sensors. The development of compact and high-sensitive magnetometer will be relevant to bio-sensing and bio-medical applications as well.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is a 25% cost reduction in solar panel manufacturing
    and the elimination of up to 2.1 Gigatons of annual CO2 generation. As silicon
    wafers are the most expensive component in the $50BN solar panel industry, our
    low-cost wafer manufacturing technology presents the strongest opportunity to
    reduce global solar panel production costs. This cost reduction drives the compelling
    economics needed for increasing solar market penetration. As context, the solar
    market has historically doubled for every 20% cost reduction created by the industry.
    Our single crystal wafers are further significantly higher quality, and therefore
    can enable up to 10% higher effective efficiency using existing commercial solar
    panel manufacturing lines. Further, as the incumbent silicon wafer production
    process is extremely energy- and material-intensive and thus constitutes 80% of
    the solar industry?s carbon footprint, our direct and high efficiency technology
    has the potential to reduce the solar industry's 2026 carbon footprint by over
    50%. \n\nThe proposed project develops the systems needed for our process to produce
    silicon wafers with commercial dimensions and demonstrates to solar manufacturers
    (our customers) that our wafers can be processed by commercial solar cell lines.
    As our process produces a continuous ribbon of silicon, this work will develop
    a cutting system that laser cuts discrete wafers with the edges and dimensions
    needed for commercial solar cell processing. This involves developing the laser
    cutting recipes, the wafer handling systems, and verifying with a third party
    that the edge quality does not interfere with cell processing. Our project then
    investigates and optimizes our wafers' performance during each critical step of
    commercial solar cell processing, including chemical etching and screen printing.
    A successful demonstration that our low-cost wafer can 'drop-in' to an existing
    cell line to deliver equivalent (or better) performance compared to the incumbent
    technology would gate our working with industry partners to commercialize this
    process.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy
    of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
    impacts review criteria."

    This Phase I SBIR project will investigate cure-in-place materials for filling and stabilizing open wounds to promote healing. Chronic wounds represent a significant and debilitating burden to patients, affecting more than 6.5 million people in the US alone. The incidence of chronic wounds is expected to rise with increasing rates of obesity and diabetes, but current treatment options show limited clinical efficacy. To address this unmet need, new materials that stimulate the body's healing mechanisms must be developed. This project will evaluate a promising new material that can be applied to a wound as a liquid and cured to a solid in contact with the wound. This cure-in-place process is expected to promote healing by ensuring intimate contact between the pro-healing material and the wound bed, mechanically stabilizing the wound area, and stimulating the body's healing responses. There are few cure-in-place materials in clinical use, so this project will also generate new fundamental engineering knowledge about these materials and their potential applications in human health. The advanced wound care market is currently valued at more than $8 billion, and it is growing. Therefore, innovative technologies in this space represent significant business opportunities that create economic growth.

    This project will investigate a novel cure-in-place process for generating a polysaccharide biomaterial that mimics the mechanical and structural properties of native extracellular matrix to stimulate wound healing. The material is generated by curing two aqueous precursor solutions to form a biodegradable, solid, and hydrated polymer matrix. This project will investigate a cure-in-place process by which the precursor solutions will be applied to the wound as liquids and cured in contact with the wound bed. If the extracellular matrix replacement biomaterial can be cured inside of a wound bed, then its pro-healing effects may be amplified due to its ability to fill an irregularly-shaped wound with complete contact with tissue and its capacity to mechanically stabilize the wound bed and stimulate pro-healing biochemistry. The scope of this effort will include developing an optimized formulation for the cure-in-place precursor solution, determining curing conditions for the biomaterial in contact with tissue, evaluating the material properties of the cure-in-place product, and evaluating cure-in-place application and wound healing efficacy in a porcine excisional wound model.

    This SBIR Phase I project will study how teachers use data to improve their instruction. In response to widespread understanding that feedback is a necessary component to improvement, school districts are increasingly investing in teacher coaches to provide feedback critical for teachers. However, this is not scalable, and typically only new or underperforming teachers have access to coaching. Earshot seeks to scale and democratize some aspects of coaching so every teacher can have access to the personalized data and feedback necessary for improvement. The goal is for all teachers to maximize their potential, better engaging students in learning.

    Earshot has developed a cloud-based system using voice analysis to provide data about instruction. The core innovation is a machine learning process to listen to dialogue between teachers and students and analyze the quality of the educational exchange. Funding for this project would enable study of two critical questions: How does providing data about teacher behavior affect what teachers do in their classrooms? And, what kinds of resources, content, and support are necessary to help teachers improve? This research has the potential to transform the way teachers use data about their own performance and receive the necessary help to improve.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project covers a myriad of domains including wireless health-care, remote education, supply-chain management, public safety, anti-poverty initiatives, market-places, and entertainment. However, a more immediate work product from this effort is a powerful fully-digital mmWave software defined radio (SDR) platform that will be made available to academic researchers at very affordable rates; this will spur further research and make mmWave testbed experimentation within the reach of lightly-funded academic research groups. The ambitious goal of making this transformative technology the reference design of future mmWave radios represents a massive commercial opportunity which is not limited to the cellular ecosystem (base station, tablets and smartphones), but rather extends to new connected players such as cars, drones, virtual reality (VR) headsets and beyond.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project focuses on the development of millimeter-wave (mmWave) radio technologies for next generation wireless systems. The mmWave frequencies of above 28 GHz are necessary to alleviate the spectrum crunch in the traditional cellular bands, and to make ultra-fast 5th Generation (5G) cellular a reality. However, the uniquely challenging propagation characteristics at these frequencies necessitates the use of transceivers that not only operate over low power budgets, but also deliver the robustness that the cellular ecosystem demands. While existing transceivers allow the radio to look (i.e., transmit or receive) in only one direction or a small number of directions at a time, the proposed transceiver design allows the radio to look in all directions simultaneously. While seemingly simple, this unique ability - combined with a top-down implementation ? will provide enormous benefits to cellular systems at reasonable power budgets. The proposed technology forms the key technological bridge between the theoretical promise of mmWave and actually achieving it in the real world.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the practical deployment of a low-cost and low-power real-time perception system in self-driving consumer cars. This edge computing functionality in sensors enables higher reliability and lower cost of overall sensing and computing needed for truly autonomous self-driving. Such innovation will contribute significantly to the early and widespread availability of safety and convenience benefits to consumers. Furthermore, the advanced perception system will have a potential long-term impact on robotics in general, which can lead to creation of new markets and new lifestyles.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop efficient algorithms and software implementation of a real-time perception system to enable the use of low-cost computing systems for self-driving cars. The algorithms provide a novel way of using image features to perform simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) with 100 times less computational costs than the existing algorithms. They also include a truly novel neural network to fuse the image feature and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) features and perform object detection, which has 100 times less complexity compared to the state-of-the-art method. These reduced-complexity algorithms can be implemented on low-power and low-cost SoC processors.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to increase the returns of grain storage for farmers and reduce overall postharvest loss due to toxin and insect damage.  Ten billion bushels, over half of US grains, are stored on-farm each year for 3-12 months.  During this period, grain is susceptible to spoilage, infestation, and moisture loss?all of which impacts the price a farmer receives at the time of market delivery.  There is no easy way to monitor grain quality changes throughout the storage season to optimize for best times to run aeration controls to preserve, condition or maintain the grain.  This leaves farmers with a ?gut check? system of driving to each grain bin site and climbing up and inside units.  Since grain is priced based on moisture baselines, farmers are essentially selling water and weight, their final price outcome can vary significantly based on how well they managed grain conditions throughout the storage period.  In the US, an annual $3 to $ 5 billion dollars (3 ? 5%) of crop value is lost due to toxin, insect and moisture mismanagement that could be prevented through the introduction of affordable and accessible monitoring technology.

    The proposed project would advance internet of things automation and wireless sensor applications as applied to production agriculture and the postharvest supply chain.  There are certain, manual processes of farm production that are strenuous due to time burdens and the lack of obtainable information to make decisions.  Monitoring grain assets, the product of farmers? toil and the safety net of global food supply, in farm bins, commercial storage, and barges is one such process. Sensing for when loss and spoilage risks occur, but more importantly connecting and turning the data into automation opportunities before they exist is the aim of this proposal.  Cable-based monitoring solutions exist, but adoption is restricted due to physical installation limitations, electricity/power constraints, and investment costs.  This project will validate the feasibility of a low-power, wireless sensor that can detect grain conditions and last a full postharvest cycle (18 months).  Such a device will create opportunities to track grain qualities across the agriculture value chain, beginning with its use to monitor and automate farm grain storage.  By characterizing, and testing against cable systems and within grain science 3D models, this project will prove the wireless sensor?s direct functionality within this first farm application.

    This SBIR Phase I project will develop Natural Language Voice-Controlled Lab Assistant technology that enables students to control and interact with hands-on science lab equipment using natural language dialog. The lab assistant technology will connect with science equipment hardware, a mobile or computer app, and cloud-based software for speech recognition and data analysis. A student can perform hands-on experiments, ask questions like "How high did my rocket go?" or "What was the force of the cart collision?", and receive audible responses based on their own experimental measurements. The lab assistant is designed for students that encompass (1) students who are blind or low vision, (2) students with disabilities affecting physical skills, (3) students that would benefit from multi-sensory learning methods as required in Individualized Education Plans (IEPs), and (4) generally students that would benefit from increased engagement in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). The broader impacts of the lab assistant technology will be to promote teaching and learning through professional development of K-12 educators in STEM, and enable broad participation of under-represented groups of people in authentic science inquiry.


    The proposed Lab Assistant will be the first application of state-of-the-art voice recognition technology for educational science experiments. The Lab Assistant will integrate with sensor hardware and mobile apps to enable hands-on experiments in physics, earth science, chemistry, and engineering. The intellectual merits of the Lab Assistant are (1) the development of software that can respond to a wide spectrum of natural language questions and (2) the systems integration of many cutting-edge technologies (wireless sensors, mobile apps, voice recognition software, cloud-based data analysis algorithms) into a simple user interface for science education. The voice interactions will help students overcome disabilities with traditional touch and visual technology, work more independently due to the presence of auditory help, work more effectively in groups, and gain confidence in their STEM abilities. For teachers, the Lab Assistant will provide an "expert in the room" to help guide the hands-on activities that they already do, and provide technical support. The Lab Assistant will be especially useful to teachers without formal science training, that nevertheless need to lead hands-on STEM activities.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will be to develop a preclinical drug characterization platform capable of profiling the effect of a drug candidate on whole protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. PPIs play a pivotal role in most diseases, and are considered high-impact therapeutic targets for cancers, autoimmune diseases, infectious diseases, and more. Over 40 clinically relevant PPIs have been disrupted successfully with small molecules, and several have entered clinical trials. One recently approved cancer drug, Venetoclax, is expected to reach $2.2B in sales by 2020. Despite the enormous clinical and commercial potential of PPI disrupting drugs, preclinical characterization remains a major challenge. Pharmaceutical companies are limited by slow and laborious techniques to measure protein interactions that require each protein to be purified, and each PPI to be measured separately. As a result, only a small subset of relevant interactions are tested during preclinical drug development, which leads to a high incidence of failure during clinical trials. The proposed platform for PPI network characterization is expected to have a major commercial and societal impact by enabling more thorough preclinical screening of PPI inhibiting drugs, reducing the overall cost and time associated with drug development.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop and commercialize a novel platform for screening PPI disrupting drugs that provides quantitative accuracy, enables simultaneous characterization of whole PPI networks, and eliminates the need for protein purification. This platform combines the throughput of a cell-based assay with the accuracy of a bioanalytical technique by linking yeast haploid mating efficiency to the affinity of proteins displayed on the cells' surfaces. Preliminary results demonstrate that next generation sequencing of diploid cells may be used to accurately measure many PPI strengths simultaneously. The goal of this project is to demonstrate that the proposed platform can correctly recapitulate whole disease-relevant PPI networks and accurately characterize well-studied inhibitors in a format that is compatible with existing high-throughput screening workflows. To demonstrate feasibility, the well-studied BCL2 PPI network, which contains unstable proteins and considerable complexity, will be analyzed to identify each pairwise PPI and compared to known interactions from the literature. The yeast strains and assay parameters will then be optimized for screening water insoluble small molecule drugs and 96-well plate compatibility. The ultimate goal of this project is to establish a new platform technology for the preclinical characterization of PPI inhibiting drug candidates.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the creation of flexible passenger identification displays for ride-hailing and automotive applications. This is a distinct pain point as many drivers choose the same model cars. Our first application is to solve ride-hailing passenger identification, but this becomes more critical with autonomous vehicles -- the only method of visual communication between an autonomous car and its target passenger will be via display. By helping to enable autonomous fleets of service vehicles, our displays will impart significant societal benefits, including reduced emissions, improved mobility for the elderly and disabled, and fewer traffic accidents. Beyond automotive, researchers estimate that in 2017 there are 20 billion devices connected to the Internet that are not computers, growing to 125 billion by 2025. These will influence many areas, including health and wellness, factory production, public safety, retail, agriculture, homes, and offices. They will enable better resource allocation, predictive maintenance, operations management, worker training, task automation, energy management, and safety. Not all of these ?Internet of Things? devices need displays, but those that do use them for input and information relay ? the exact uses for which our displays are designed.

    The proposed project will develop roll-to-roll printed passive matrix OLED (PMOLED) display technology. PMOLED displays are built upon a patterned transparent conductive anode that defines the pixels. To date, the only method used in industry to create this anode is photolithography. This is a slow and expensive batch process, but it is the only method that can produce the required results. Our high-resolution printable anode replaces both the incumbent material and the lithographic process to create a continuous roll of plastic covered in OLED anodes that can be loaded into a printing press. This lays the foundation for fully printed displays, fabricated using flexography, the same technique used to print newspapers. Through this work, we will produce fully printed PMOLED display prototypes. These thin, flexible displays will have extremely high contrast while using only 20% of the power required by a backlit LCD, with wide viewing angles for easy readability and flexibility to conform to any surface. If successful, we will be able to print displays 1000 times faster than the industry standard throughput while reducing materials waste by 80%. Such cost savings will make our displays the obvious choice for information display use, especially in design-driven applications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the ability to sustainably produce more food with fewer water and energy resources. To feed nine billion people on this planet by 2050 we need to develop new systems of agriculture. Indoor agriculture has the potential to transform the way we grow and source our food, enabling locally-sourced crops at higher yields. Food crops can be grown sustainably year-round near all major urban centers if the energy and water consumption of greenhouses could be reduced. This research will lead to the creation of a suite of water management products and services for indoor farming applications thereby making indoor agriculture environmentally sustainable and economically viable.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will commercialize a novel metal organic framework (MOF) material that enables a new class of compact, energy-efficient cooling and dehumidification systems for greenhouses. Recent discoveries at MIT have revealed a novel MOF material with unprecedented water adsorption capacity. Moreover, the MOF material may be readily synthesized from low-cost, bulk commodity chemicals. A dehumidifier operating with this material can harvest waste heat to provide optimal temperature and humidity conditions for controlled environment agriculture. To translate the MOF material from research lab into large scale production, the material must demonstrate sufficient durability under cycling conditions, be designed to afford low cost processing and be integrated into a cost-efficient climate control system that takes advantage of its unique properties. The goal of the proposed R&D is to accelerate durability testing, design a process chemistry to enable low-cost manufacturing and develop system-level models to
    analyze lifecycle performance and cost sensitivity in an indoor farming application.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) project is the development of an effective and sustainable alternative
    to antibiotics and biocides used in animal feed, which will help mitigate the
    global health threat of multidrug-resistant bacteria. The beef cattle industry
    is under increasing regulatory and public pressure to reduce or eliminate the
    use of antibiotic feed additives as they are considered a major factor driving
    the proliferation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. However, in-feed antibiotics
    provide significant economic and animal welfare benefits to the cattle industry
    by reducing the incidence and severity of liver abscesses. This project provides
    an alternative for these conflicting concerns by providing a cost-effective alternative
    to in-feed antibiotics. Further, with sufficient understanding of how the rumen
    microbiome impacts animal physiology and performance, this technology could be
    easily adapted to selectively target microbial species that reduce animal growth
    or feed efficiency, or that produce methane, increasing the economic and environmental
    sustainability of livestock agriculture. \n\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes
    to develop a low-dose, bacteriophage-based feed additive that can be prophylactically
    administered to control the growth of pathogenic Fusobacterium necrophorum in
    cattle rumen. F. necrophorum is a causative agent of liver abscesses in grain-fed
    cattle, and antibiotics are currently added to feed to prevent its growth and
    limit abscess occurrence. However, in-feed antibiotics promote the proliferation
    of antibiotic resistant bacteria, and can cause undesirable off-target effects
    to the rumen microbiome. This research seeks to develop broad host-range (polyvalent)
    bacteriophages as an economical means of controlling cattle pathogens. Polyvalent
    bacteriophages will be isolated using specialized methods that select for those
    with a predetermined host-range based on rumen microbial composition. Each bacteriophage
    will then be characterized and tested for efficacy within a bioreactor operated
    to simulate the cattle rumen. Bacteriophage cocktails will be formulated and tested
    for their ability to minimize the development of bacteriophage resistance. The
    expected outcome of the proposed research is a library of polyvalent bacteriophages
    that can effectively control F. necrophorum under rumen-like conditions, and which
    will be further tested in animal studies.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to develop single cell analysis technology to provide insight into cellular mechanisms, which has the potential to transform drug development and manufacturing. Single-cell analysis, or the ability to decipher cell-to-cell heterogeneity, is a limiting factor in biotechnology and clinical applications. This project aims to further develop a transformative platform technology for integrated single-cell analysis capable of addressing existing challenges with the current state-of-the-art. The platform will potentially shift the paradigm of drug development and manufacturing, enabling quick iteration and evaluation of new therapeutic compounds. This approach could significantly reduce the time and cost to bring new drugs to market and reduce the overall cost of treating patients, which is a substantial benefit to society. Beyond this initial application, this single-cell analysis platform could become a readily implemented research tool, enhancing our basic understanding of biology, facilitate engineering of cell function, as well as evaluating safety and efficacy of new drugs and treatments.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a robust and cost effective commercial prototype technology platform for integrated single-cell analysis. A key feature of the platform technology is the unprecedented sensitivity in measuring quantitatively secreted molecules from single cells. This is achieved by incubating single cells in extremely small volumes, and enabling analytics on an unprecedented scale in these microscopic bioreactors. The proposed work will lead to the development of a consumable prototype microfluidic chip, enabling quick and resource efficient adaptation of the platform to the marketplace. The proposed prototype will be validated through relevant studies, addressing a confirmed market need in cell line development. Commercial adaptation of this prototype will potentially provide deep insight into biological and physiological processes on a single-cell level, and transform drug development and manufacturing, therapeutic treatment, as well as clinical diagnostics.

    Research (SBIR) project is to develop technology to prevent seafood fraud through
    enabling wholesalers, restaurants, and consumers to rapidly identify mislabeled
    fish product outside of controlled laboratory settings. U.S. consumers are subjected
    to mislabeling errors one out of every three times they consume seafood. Species
    that are cheaper and easier to source are commonly swapped for higher value fish
    such as tuna, snapper, and grouper. This substitution occurs at multiple points
    in the supply chain, from producers/processors to wholesalers to restaurants.
    U.S. consumers pay approximately $32 billion for mislabeled seafood on an annual
    basis. Additionally, this seafood may pose a serious health concern or counteract
    regulatory efforts focused on managing vulnerable fish populations and illegal
    fishing. Current seafood identification efforts are insufficient to eradicate
    mislabeling because they require controlled laboratory settings and highly trained
    personnel.  A few portable tests are becoming available but they lack the ability
    to screen large numbers of samples cost-effectively. The platform proposed here
    will enable more widespread seafood identification testing by delivering identification
    within 45 minutes, on-site, and for a lower per sample cost than existing technologies.
    \n\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes to address seafood mislabeling by developing
    a fast and portable DNA-based screening platform to allow for accurate seafood
    identification to address concerns from consumers, retailers, and regulators regarding
    seafood mislabeling.  The key component of the platform to be developed is a nanopore-based
    sensor technology, which is an amplification-free method for direct counting of
    target nucleic acids. It has been demonstrated in preliminary results that the
    technology is able to distinguish grouper DNA from catfish with single-nucleotide
    specificity. This technology also has achieved multiplexed detection, distinguishing
    36 sequences with one sensor. This project will advance this detection assay towards
    a commercial-ready product by expanding the multiplexing strategy to cover 200+
    sequences, designing probes to distinguish 20+ fish species, and then completing
    a full commercial proof-of-principle by identifying seafood species in blinded
    samples in work done on-site.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to enable autonomous vehicles to make risk-aware decisions at high-speed, by reasoning about the uncertain movements of the people and cars around them to anticipate risks and react defensively. This technology will make new technical approaches to safety and risk viable for the first time. It will enable autonomous cars to drive at regular speeds in dense, highly populated urban environments while reducing the likelihood of accidents - thereby resulting in faster, safer urban autonomous driving. This will increase public trust in autonomous cars and accelerate the development of a new industry which could reshape transportation, freeing people from the need to drive their own cars and increasing their free time and productivity.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a specialized processor for risk-aware motion planning for autonomous vehicles. Motion planning is a critical problem for autonomous cars, which must decide how to move through space to reach a designated goal without colliding with a static obstacle, another vehicle, or a pedestrian. Existing approaches can only construct a few plans per second, and assume that the other road-users will continue on their current trajectories. This is acceptable for highways but not for urban driving, where distances are short and other road-users can change behavior suddenly. This project aims to develop a prototype of a specialized motion planning processor that plans in milliseconds, enabling it to consider all likely future movements of other road-users to anticipate risks and react defensively. This proposal aims to evaluate the feasibility of the processor by designing a prototype, demonstrating that it results in safer driving at normal speeds in urban environments, and quantifying its performance improvements over existing solutions.

    This SBIR Phase I project aims to demonstrate the technical feasibility of a first-of-its-kind injectable gel for treating osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis, a disease of the body's joints, affects greater than 27 million Americans, and the proposed activity will de-risk the proprietary gel technology to warrant continued development of a medical device for treating osteoarthritis. The product is a bioinspired polymer gel solution, to be administered by injection into the joint, which will lubricate, cushion, and protect the joint's cartilage from wear, and thereby slow the progression of osteoarthritis. Upon successful completion of this project, the company aims to complete the preclinical and clinical studies required to gain regulatory approval for the product emanating from the proposed activity. From this project, a deeper fundamental understanding of body-biomaterial interactions will be gained, benefiting engineers, clinicians, and ultimately patients. The anticipated commercial success of this product will result in job creation both before and after completion of product development. As joint pain is one of the leading causes of missed work, disability, and general depreciation of quality of life, successful completion of the proposed high-technical-risk project will lay the foundation for development of an impactful medical device which will treat the highly prevalent disease osteoarthritis.

    The innovation of this project's technology lies in the patented synthetic techniques and composition of a tissue-protective gel solution that remains in the joint capsule at therapeutic concentrations for significantly longer than current injectable gels remain. All injectable viscoelastics approved in the United States for treating osteoarthritis are comprised of hyaluronic acid, a biopolymer which degrades rapidly upon injection; in contrast, the product in this project uses a synthetic, bioinspired polymer which resists degradation and maintains effective viscoelastic properties for four months, whereas current products' viscoelasticity is degraded after one week. The project's first objective will, through a radiolabeled biodistribution study, ascertain the gel's distribution throughout the body following injection into rodent knees, to demonstrate 100% clearance out of the animal and no accumulation within any tissues or organs. The project's second objective will develop the material processing techniques and syringe filling protocol for formulating the gel into its final product form and ensuring product performance and safety specifications are met. Completion of these objectives will allow product to be made under FDA-compliant Design Control for a pivotal large animal study to be conducted following this project, along with completion of formal biocompatibility testing for submission to FDA to seek approval for a First-in-Human clinical trial.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is the development of yeast fermentation technologies that enable conversion of sugars abundant in pectin-rich agricultural waste into useful specialty chemicals. The U.S. is a leading producer of pectin-rich agricultural wastes including citrus peels (>5 million tons annually), sugar beets (>37 million tons annually), and grape pomace (>1 million tons annually). These peel and pulp byproducts lack value, however, the proposed technologies developed in this project will allow for significantly higher valued products to be produced from these waste streams. The initial target chemical product is used as a chelator in cleaning products and a precursor to plastics. Other chemical products potentially may be produced using this platform. Implementation of this fermentation process offers a lower carbon footprint and emissions compared to petroleum or even other sugar-derived products, and has impact in reducing waste and combating climate change. When implemented at scale, these fermentation processing plants will be co-located with rural agricultural processing plants, adding high-tech jobs in these areas, and offering a means to de-risk historically volatile crop harvests by accessing alternative markets.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to engineer yeast strains capable of converting sugars in pectin-rich agricultural wastes into valuable specialty chemicals. Currently, the fermentation rates for utilizing the primary sugar in pectin, D-galacturonic acid, limits production of these chemicals, including the proposed first product, which is a biodegradable metal chelator. Previous characterization has identified that uptake of the pectin sugars by a transporter as the limiting step. Accordingly, the first objective of this proposal is to characterize this class of transporter to identify new transporters with improved rates. The second objective is to improve the best transporter through protein engineering. Using this improved transporter, the final objective will assess the cellular energy requirements for the fermentation process using bioreactors to control fermenter conditions, as product synthesis and transport is energy-demanding. If successful, this project will enable production of specialty chemicals from pectin-rich agricultural waste.

    Research (SBIR) project is in the development of new technologies to manufacture
    personalized therapies for cancer and other diseases that are based on a patient's
    own cells.  Such therapies have shown remarkable success in recent years, however,
    manufacturing these therapies is challenging because mass production techniques
    cannot be employed when each patient receives a unique therapy.  Indeed, for therapies
    based on dendritic cells, which are an important part of the human immune system,
    there are no manufacturing systems currently available that can perform all of
    the required steps.  This project will address this major unmet need by leveraging
    advanced concepts in engineering and biology to design an integrated system for
    cost-effective manufacturing of dendritic cell therapies.  Given the large number
    of personalized cell-based therapies currently in clinical trials, and recently
    approved therapies, such a system is expected to address a major societal need
    and have significant commercial potential.  \n\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes
    to develop a manufacturing system to cover the steps involved in the manufacturing
    of autologous dendritic cell therapies.  Because of the low abundance of these
    cells in blood, dendritic cells are typically generated from blood-derived monocytes.
    \ Following differentiation of monocytes into dendritic cells, these cells are
    then matured and stimulated with tumor-specific antigens.  These steps represent
    discrete unit operations that require a system capable of handling both adherent
    and non-adherent cell types, different reagents for each step, and the ability
    to transition from one step to another with minimal loss of cells.  Further, all
    steps must be performed in a disposable single-use enclosure.  In order to achieve
    automation and integration of these steps, the proposed system will leverage innovations
    in perfusion-based dendritic cell culture and novel and cost-effective bioreactor
    design strategies.  A combination of computational modeling and rapid-prototyping
    techniques will be employed for rapid iteration of prototypes and testing with
    potential users involved in therapeutic development.  Successful completion of
    this project will result in feasibility demonstration of an integrated manufacturing
    system developed with significant end user feedback.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to develop a drug discovery platform for preclinical cancer drug testing using a 3D tumor model technology. The technology is designed to reduce time and costs associated with the high failure rate (~95%) of cancer drugs by increasing the likelihood that candidate drugs advancing to animal studies will be effective. The robotic technology will provide a biologically relevant tumor model to test libraries of cancer drugs in the preclinical stage, and replace currently used 2D cancer cell models. This project aims to scale up the 3D tumor model technology to accommodate large drug libraries tested in the pharmaceutical industry, and verify that it meets industry standards and customer needs. The technology will expedite the introduction of effective cancer drugs into the market for patient use, and help reduce the more than half a million of lives that cancer claims annually. The proposed work will significantly facilitate the introduction of the technology into the market as a preclinical cancer drug screening tool by demonstrating its competitive advantages and capabilities to improve cancer drug discovery efforts.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop and validate a 3D tumor model technology for high-throughput cancer drug screening in the pharmaceutical industry. Despite widespread interest in 3D cancer cell cultures, existing methods are not currently used in the industry due to their many disadvantages. The proposed technology provides a robust, high-throughput, and cost-effective approach to generate 3D cancer cell cultures for rapid drug screening, beyond what is currently available. This work will evaluate quantitatively the reliability and robustness of 3D cancer cell cultures and costs of cancer drug testing while considering competitive techniques. A major goal is to adapt the technology to a 1536-microwell plate format for highly efficient drug screening, which is not currently available on the market, and validate the capabilities of the technology to predict cancer drug responses in animal studies. This work will involve robotic protocol optimization, imaging analysis of 3D cultures for consistency, proof-of-concept cancer drug screening, and statistical evaluation of robustness. It is anticipated that the work will demonstrate the advantageous capacity and speed of the technology for drug testing, industry-level robustness, compatibility with different cancer cell types, ability to predict animal study drug responses, and low cost.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to provide the capability to affordably and reliably connect underserved or unserved Americans to high speed internet using surface-mounted optical fiber, whether they live in a suburban neighborhood or in a remote rural area. The lack of high speed internet access is largely due to an inability to economically distribute broadband communications over the 'last mile' to businesses, homes, schools, and medical or government entities. An understanding of the installed durability of fiber using this technique will usher in new developments to deploy surface-mounted fiber nationwide. More accessible high-speed internet provides more information, opportunity, and economic productivity regardless of the locale. The digital divide between urban and rural Americans could be reduced or eliminated. Lower cost fiber deployments will make it easier to deploy new technologies, like 5G antennas and connected vehicles, and will shrink the cost to make cities smarter with ubiquitous sensors and cameras.

    The proposed project will demonstrate that optical fibers under protective coatings bonded to paved surfaces can provide reliable high speed communications while subjected to weather and traffic. It will allow estimation of the predicted life time of surface mounted fiber on pavement. The testing will place asphalt samples in an environmental test chamber to evaluate competing fiberoptic installations and to identify the best performers for a series of follow-on field and lab tests. This will allow the future targeting of financial resources on the most promising material and profile combinations. Test samples will undergo wide ranging temperature and humidity cycles and repetitive tire impacts under controlled conditions. This testing will identify statistical life predictions in years after only a few months of actual test time. The longer the predicted life, the larger the customer pool, and the wider the potential market penetration. Understanding the predicted lifetime of a fiber installation will open the door to more early adopters, to more pilot program users, and eventually to fiberoptic installers and long term customers.

    This SBIR Phase I project is dedicated to producing software that makes it easy for people with special needs, especially those on the autism spectrum, to compose their own music. A wide base of evidence shows that music can be a powerful emotional and creative outlet for people with disabilities. Multiple studies show that music can help children on the autism spectrum improve their skills in social interaction, verbal communication,initiating behavior, and social-emotional reciprocity. However, public access to music education has declined dramatically in the United States over the last 40 years. The 6.6 million students in the US with special needs face further barriers to music education because of the significant financial resources and demanding degree of physical dexterity required by instrument lessons. Within this context, private sector innovation is more necessary than ever to increase the accessibility of music education. By offering affordable and intuitive software this project has the potential to make a major impact on the economy by helping to reduce education and health care costs for parents of children with special needs, school special education programs, and adults with disabilities. Just as importantly, democratizing the joy of musical creativity will make a powerful contribution to unlocking the passion, talents, and productivity of people with special needs.


    To make it easy for people with special needs to make their own music, this project will employ gestural composition, responsive design, and data science to produce a software interface that adapts to a users' accessibility preferences based on their previous interactions with the program. A second focus of the project is to produce interactive music lessons focused on self-expression and socio-emotional intelligence. Lessons will utilize and expand upon the creative interface to guide users to write songs that express their mood. Robust user testing and intelligent application of machine learning will be required to ensure that the interface smoothly evolves to enable user creativity. Considerable experimentation will also be required to build lessons which strike a balance between supporting users through linear instruction and empowering users to make expressive decisions and take ownership of their emotions. To mitigate the project's technical risk special needs experts and health professionals will be consulted at every stage of user testing and development. In sum, these innovations address the significant and urgent challenge of opening music up as a medium of creativity, communication and self-expression for people with special needs, especially those on the autism spectrum.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project views an IoT firearms detection system in the lens of the military due to their immediate need of such a device and associated data. In addition, a foothold in the military will allow for and influence the adoption in downstream markets such as private security and law enforcement who have already expressed interest in piloting and adopting this technology once fully developed. However, the broader goal and impact of this system more importantly grants the potential to save lives. Whether this system will be used in the military, law enforcement, or private citizens in cases of home and self defense, successful implementation and commercialization of the first firearms detection system will grant the capabilities to objectively monitor and leverage firearm usage data.

    The proposed project aims to research, develop, and commercialize an integrated IoT system dedicated to detecting and processing small arms firearm discharges. The challenge in achieving the goals of this project is two-fold: one to create an IoT system that satisfies the stringent and high standards of the customer and two, to create value within the data collected by these IoT sensors. The proposed research and development covers the creation of a prototype device as well as generating a roadmap based on product and user feedback towards effective use of the data to ensure commercial success.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in improving the quality of general and task lighting and reducing the amount of wasted light, thus reducing energy consumption. Solid state lighting has caused a paradigm shift in the lighting industry. However, the rapid growth of the LED has surpassed our understanding of its effects on human health and productivity, as well as the environment. Developing systems that put light only where it is needed can reduce energy consumption and improve well-being by eliminating glare and wasted light. Full control over where artificial lights shine may also reduce the disruption of natural ecosystems and agriculture caused by light pollution.? Unfortunately, a compact and low-cost solution to spatially controllable illumination is not available. Should one be brought to market, the industry could be tailored to meet the needs of each street lamp, each office worker and the entertainment industry among others. The ubiquitous nature of artificial illumination provides a unique commercial opportunity with multiple market segments for growth potential.

    The proposed project will focus on a microsystems solution to steerable lighting using a low-power, low-cost, silicon-based mirror less than 1 mm in diameter. The mirror is capable of real-time adjustments that will steer incident light with significant angular range. It is controlled using digital electronics and easily combined with traditional smart home electronics. The objective of the research is to measure the optical output of varying system setups and optical components to determine what optics are necessary for proper light output shape, uniformity, and color temperature. The project will rely heavily on a combination of test measurements and simulations to cycle through experiments rapidly and efficiently in order to converge on a manufacturing plan.

    Research (SBIR) project is the development of a microalgae-based commercial hydrogen
    production process that will surpass current or developing technologies. By 2022,
    the global hydrogen generation market by value is projected to reach $154.7 billion.
    A technology for low-cost, high purity, renewable, scalable hydrogen production
    will accelerate transition to a hydrogen economy, thus facilitating domestic energy
    independence and creating new economic opportunities. Many industries, such as
    the petro-chemical, chemical, and electronics industries, would benefit from low
    cost industrial hydrogen. Transportation and electric power generation industries
    also would benefit from increased fuel efficiency. Environmental benefits include
    replacement of fossil fuels, switching hydrogen production from natural gas to
    sunlight and water, and substantial reduction of harmful emissions. The goal of
    this project is to incorporate proprietary, metabolically engineered, photosynthetic
    algae in combination with recent advances in bioprocessing and hardware engineering
    to manufacture clean, renewable hydrogen. \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research
    Phase I project proposes to develop microalgae strains that generate high hydrogen
    yields using a novel metabolic engineering strategy. To pursue this strategy,
    a suitable parental strain must be developed, combining intact hydrogen production
    genes with improved stability of introduced genes (transgenes). Despite the availability
    of genetic transformation methods, transgene stability in wild type strains remains
    poor. This seriously limits development of commercial strains. Two algal UV mutants
    with greatly improved transgene stability are available, but both have impaired
    hydrogen production genes. The proposed investigation will assess the feasibility
    of creating a suitable parental strain. The objectives are: 1) determine differences
    between genes of the best wild type hydrogen producing strain and the UV mutants;
    2) introduce candidate genes into the UV mutants to restore hydrogen production
    metabolism; 3) knock out candidate genes involved in transgene inactivation in
    the wild type strain; and 4) test the ability of the engineered strains to generate
    hydrogen and retain transgenes. This project will produce the desired parental
    strain and enable implementation of the innovative strategy for developing production
    strains with greatly increased hydrogen rates in the target commercial process.\n\nThis

    This SBIR Phase I project is intended to develop a noninvasive, ultra-sensitive molecular
    detection system for Tuberculosis (TB). Although the prevalence of TB has diminished, it still
    remains the second leading cause of death from an infectious disease. The latest global TB report
    from the World Health Organization with data compiled from 205 countries put the figures at 1.5
    million fatalities and 9.6 million infections annually. The proposed technology uses the nano-
    Plasmonic Grating (P-GRAT) properties to enhance the detection signal of the TB biomarker by
    more than 100X. This results in detecting concentrations in femto-gram/milliliter range resulting
    in early detection and treatment. The specificity, faster results, low cost/test and ease of use,
    makes this system a substantive innovation in the TB diagnostic market. The TB testing market
    accounts for $1.5 billion annually of which North America is the second largest in terms of
    generated revenue due to the higher pricing for TB detection. The proposed technology will
    benefit the patients with early diagnosis and provide the health care professionals with early
    treatment options. With all the advantages this technology has to offer, it is expected to gain a
    significant share in the market place and generate a revenue stream.

    The main limitation of the immunoassays is their inability to detect extremely small fluorescence
    signals that are associated with ultra-low concentrations of biomarkers. The proposed nano-
    Plasmonic Grating (P-GRAT) technology can overcome this limitation due to its exceptionally
    efficient light coupling, reduced scattering, high signal-to-noise ratio and directional
    excitation/emission. As a result, a fluorescence enhancement of P-GRAT is 100X or higher
    compared to a glass substrates or polyurethane well plates. Such enhancements translate to ultrasensitive
    detection and early diagnosis. Commercial immunoassays require hours to days to
    achieve pg/ml sensitivity. In comparison, P-GRAT can detect pg/mL range concentrations in less
    than three hours. P-GRAT utilizes a simplified design to exclude expensive optics like laser
    sources, high-magnification objective lenses and filter cubes. The use of 3-D printed parts to
    fabricate the system and use a smartphone as the detector further reduces the cost. We intend to
    develop and commercialize a noninvasive, ultra-sensitive (fg/ml) molecular detection system for
    Tuberculosis (TB). TB specific biomarkers Lipoarabinomannan (LAM) and Interferon gamma
    (IFN-g) will be detected in urine and saliva. P-GRAT is a platform technology and can easily be
    adapted for the ultra-sensitive detection and diagnosis of other diseases, such as Zika, Ebola,
    HIV and Cancer.

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a minimally-invasive
    device that can be used to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) by safely
    injecting a proprietary substance into the base of the esophagus.  GERD is the
    most common gastrointestinal diagnosis in the US, afflicting ~26% of adult Americans
    (>60 million people), undermining their sleep, productivity, and quality of life,
    and leading to other gastrointestinal diseases. Approximately one third of GERD
    patients continue to suffer from symptoms despite currently available medications
    treatment. Moreover, long-term use of currently prescribed drugs has side effects
    and risks. Current surgical solutions are invasive, costly and carry significant
    risk. The proposed injection system is expected to enable a novel, less invasive
    and less costly treatment for GERD, leading to reduction of overall healthcare
    costs and preventing or reducing the incidence of other gastrointestinal diseases.
    Given the large market size for GERD and profound clinical need, this project
    directly addresses a critical barrier to developing such therapy for GERD patients.
    It has the potential to significantly improve treatment of such a common disorder,
    to become a standard of care and generate tax revenues and jobs. \n\nThe project
    seeks to develop an endoscopic injection system for consistent multiple injections
    of bulking agent into the submucosal tissue plane in the lower esophagus. At the
    heart of this technology will be a novel injection system that utilizes a suction
    port to grasp the esophageal wall and direct a needle tip to the desired submucosal
    depth of the affixed tissue. The design of the needle and needle guidance system
    will be optimized for injection of viscous solutions and will be used for injection
    of a bulking agent that creates submucosal tissue bulging at the lower esophagus,
    ultimately preventing gastroesophageal reflux. The proposed device will be unique
    in its ability to accurately guide submucosal injections to the desired tissue
    plane. This will be the first system to use vacuum assist for targeted injections
    into submucosal space. Rapid iterative 3D-printing prototyping will be employed
    to optimize needle guide geometry and design. Repeatability of the injections
    with the system will be tested into multiple samples of cadaveric porcine esophagus
    tissue and porcine cadavers. Impleo already owns an issued US method Patent to
    inject bulking agent in the esophagus and plans to generate additional IP in this
    project.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to develop protein purification technology that will provide access to inexpensive, purified proteins for biological and life science applications by removing the purification bottleneck in biopharmaceutical production, and leveraging the innovative breakthroughs in protein engineering and gene editing.  Scale-up of this technology will transform the large-scale purification of biopharmaceuticals and lower prescription drug costs - the most important factor contributing to rising healthcare costs.  The major factor influencing the rising cost of healthcare is the skyrocketing costs of pharmaceuticals - up to 40% of the medical plan cost will be drugs by 2025.  Prescription drug costs are the fastest rising component of healthcare and are contributing to the dramatic increase in healthcare costs.  The worldwide focus of pharmacy and biotechnology is now on biopharmaceutical development and production to address this issue.  Direct benefits of this project include low-cost, use of green reagents, and the absence of heavy metal impurities in the purified protein.  In addition, the development of immobilized enzymes using this technology will open new frontiers in biocatalysis, biosensors, diagnostics and protein delivery.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop protein purification kits for small-scale and research-scale research. Bringing these kits to market will enable researchers to further validate the technology on a broader range of proteins in preparation for scale-up for biopharmaceutical production.  Synthetic biology has quickly begun to revolutionize drug discovery and design by providing a better overall molecular understanding of disease.  However, this potential has yet to be fully realized due to the challenges associated with purifying the target recombinant protein from the thousands of naturally-occurring proteins produced by the expression system.  The three specific aims of the project are: 1) validation of protein tag performance for multiple protein classes and expression systems, 2) development of low-cost methods for protein tag removal from purified proteins, and 3) development of solutions for the purification of low-expressing proteins and the parallel purification of small amounts of proteins.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop the process to 3D print continuous fiber reinforced ceramic matrix composite (CMC) components for turbine and combustion engines, hypersonic vehicles, and satellites. CMCs are currently a $2.5b market that is expected to triple over the next decade. The ability to produce CMCs with 3D printing will enable superior designs in current applications, as well as enabling their use in a greater number of components that are currently limited by the higher density and lower temperature capabilities of superalloys such as Inconel and Invar. Developing this manufacturing process will enable more basic materials research by serving as a lower cost testbed for new CMC compositions since a mold is not required and turnaround times are much faster. This will also allow engineers to develop more optimized systems with a faster design cycle. This capability will result in efficiency increases in turbine and combustion engines for substantial improvements in fuel efficiency, reducing costs and environmental impact. Finally, the ability to 3D print CMCs will vastly improve geometric complexity of high temperature components, which will enable the next generation of hypersonic vehicles, supporting national defense.

    The intellectual merit of this project is in establishing a novel manufacturing process for CMCs based on 3D printing. Melt infiltration is a low cost method to produce CMCs, which starts with a polymer matrix composite that is pyrolyzed, and then infiltrated with a molten metal. The matrix is usually a phenolic thermoset, but high temperature thermoplastics have recently been proven viable for simple coupons. This project will use 5-axis continuous fiber reinforced high temperature thermoplastic composites as green bodies. Since thermoplastics melt, support materials will be implemented during the pyrolysis step, which are effective in retaining part geometry. Additionally, a novel process of growing a boron nitride interphase layer on the fibers after pyrolysis instead of prior to forming the polymer composite will be implemented since tight corners during printing might damage an interphase layer. Finally, 3D printing with larger bend radius silicon carbide fibers instead of carbon fibers will be attempted. This project will demonstrate the effectiveness of this interphase with improved flexural strength and toughness, and the ability to form geometrically complex CMCs that are extremely difficult, if not impossible, to make with other methods. These two milestones will enable a path to begin developing parts for customers in commercial applications.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will explore a novel materials processing technology that progresses the state-of-the-art of carbon fiber composites while leveraging mature and cost-efficient manufacturing methods. The processing technology of interest produces a material that approaches the isotropic properties of high-performance metal alloys while retaining the light-weight and stiffness of carbon fiber composites. Components that are fabricated from this new composite will have higher impact strength and reduced susceptibility to delamination, compared to commercially-available carbon fiber composites. The broader impact of this project includes providing engineers with a new tool to implement previously unfeasible designs that drastically improve performance while reducing energy consumption and material waste. The rapid adoption of carbon fiber composites in the wind energy, aerospace, and defense industries provides an opportunity for the novel material developed in this project to disrupt the $25-billion global carbon fiber composite market. Effective scale-up to industrial production of the novel carbon fiber composite can revitalize the Massachusetts textiles manufacturing ecosystem and increase the competitiveness of the U.S. advanced materials manufacturing base.

    The intellectual merit of this project is the continuous production of a three-dimensionally (3-D) reinforced carbon fiber prepreg that features a carbon fiber fabric reinforced with vertically aligned short carbon fibers. This novel material provides a laminated composite part with dense through-thickness and interlaminar reinforcement. Conventional carbon fiber laminates lack through-thickness reinforcement and rely on an unfilled polymer matrix to bind the layers of the laminate together, resulting in poor impact performance and frequent delamination. This project involves the roll-to-roll fabrication of 3-D reinforced carbon fiber prepregs and characterization of the produced composite material. The anticipated result of the project is the repeatable fabrication of a 3-D reinforced carbon fiber prepreg with enhanced performance compared to commercially-available prepregs. Successful completion of this project will enable further scale-up of the associated manufacturing technology and the commercial-launch of novel 3-D reinforced carbon fiber prepregs to produce stronger, lighter, and more durable composite structures.

    a cost-effective and scalable direct recycling method for producing battery-grade
    cathode materials from end-of-life (EOL) lithium-ion batteries. The commercialization
    of the proposed direct lithium-ion battery recycling technology will lower the
    energy consumption and emissions associated with battery production, reduce demand
    for raw battery materials and decrease lithium-ion battery manufacturing cost.
    Using directly recycled materials instead of raw battery materials will diminish
    or even avoid the negative environmental impacts from mining and processing ores
    and from disposal of hazardous waste. Reducing battery cost will facilitate the
    implementation of more efficient electrified vehicles, thus reducing petroleum
    demand and vehicle emissions. Finally, research on the end-of-life lithium-ion
    battery cathode, on the direct recycling process and on the recycled materials
    will advance the understanding of intercalation chemistry in nonaqueous and aqueous
    media and of electrode degradation during electrochemical cycling. \n\nThe intellectual
    merit of this project is to advance the direct recycling technology through the
    design and demonstration of a scalable electrochemical flow system capable of
    non-destructive relithiation and the optimization of post treatment operation
    for the recovered materials. The electrochemical flow system is capable of restoring
    the lost lithium in the EOL cathode material at any state of charge (SOC) and
    can be scaled to a commercially viable size. The cathode materials recovered in
    the proposed direct recycling process retain the same structure and morphology
    and exhibit equivalent electrochemical performance compared to the commercial

    improves the profitability of lithium-ion battery recycling and is a key element
    of the business plan.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been

    The broader impact / commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to enable electrification of remote oil & gas processes to reduce methane emissions, improve on-site safety, and provide leak-detection and monitoring capabilities. This will be achieved by developing a robust, efficient, small-scale power generator capable of converting on-site fuel to electricity. Beyond the entry opportunity in the oil & gas sector, this technology has other applications in large markets such as residential and commercial power generation and heating, transportation, and military. For example, our proposed generators would allow consumers in moderate/cold climates to efficiently match their time-dependent heating and electrical demands using natural gas (accessible to 70 million households). For a typical household in those regions, we estimate a 45% reduction in primary energy use and CO2 emissions by deploying our generators. The energy reduction translates to an annual savings of about $650 per household. Widespread deployment of our technology would grow the domestic natural gas economy, strengthen the US technological lead in semiconductor manufacturing, and facilitate renewables by providing a dispatchable supply.?

    The proposed project will investigate the fundamental heat-to-electric conversion process and address key issues around the stability and robustness of the technology, through a synergistic effort to develop generators capable of high performance and a manufacturing process to reduce cost. The project will focus on device optimization and durability, and process repeatability. This involves the fabrication and integration of multiple frequency-selective components including a thermal emitter, optical filter, photovoltaic cell, and back surface reflector. Each component, as well as the integrated system, will undergo rigorous thermal testing to prove both resistance to elevated temperatures and temperature swings. Additionally, novel manufacturing techniques will be developed to enable cost-competitive devices relative to conventional generators. If the technical objectives are met, this project will demonstrate record-breaking performance for thermophotovoltaics and accelerate the commercialization of thermophotovoltaic devices in many different markets.?

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer(STTR) project is to develop a bio-based manufacturing process for glucaric acid and its intermediate, glucuronic acid. Microbial fermentation represents an attractive option for production of fuels and valuable chemicals from renewable resources, and glucaric acid can be produced from glucose, a renewable biomass-derived resource.  The glucaric acid market was estimated at $550M in 2016, and has a plethora of uses ranging from detergents to food ingredients, corrosion inhibitors, and de-icing applications.  The proposed project will engineer improved productivity of the microbe using C5/C6 sugars, thus accelerating the production of low-cost, high-purity glucaric acid. Achieving these bioprocess improvements will facilitate widespread adoption of bio-based glucaric acid in a variety of markets, broadening opportunity for US products. These applications include coatings, foams and foaming aids, electrolytes, gels, polymers, and polymer additives.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to perform multi-omics studies to characterize the physiology of E. coli strains producing glucaric acid via fermentation, and develop strain engineering strategies to enable high yield and productivity. Most fermentation products are highly reduced compared to the starting sugar, and care must be taken to maintain cells in a reduced state, meaning high NADH/NAD ratio, to drive the NADH-consuming biosynthetic reactions. Products that are derived from sugar oxidation, in contrast, pose a much different challenge, and have been explored to a much lesser extent. Here, additional oxygen is needed to accept the excess electrons generated during glucose oxidation. It is well known that both S. cerevisiae and E. coli, two of the most common organisms for industrial application, are limited in their electron transport chain capacity, resulting in overflow products from high glucose uptake rates. Regardless of the oxygen transfer ability of the fermentation equipment, there is an inherent maximum production rate of these organisms. In this project, the plan is to develop E. coli strains with increased respiration capacity, thus increasing the maximum glucose oxidation rate. Glucaric acid, which can be produced from glucose via 3 enzymatic reaction steps, is an exemplary product.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to provide the agriculture market a long-term solution to the problem of premature wear on components from oil leaks  by digitally monitoring oil levels in combines. The proposed product could be adapted to many industries including agriculture, mining, construction, marine water craft, chemical storage, military vehicles, and water storage. The proposed product will preemptively warn equipment operators of low lubrication levels thereby saving customers money from repairs or replacement of new systems.

    The proposed project will address the need of digitally monitoring oil lubrication levels while producing a highly accurate measurement in real-time. The solution will be non-contacting unlike current solutions that provide a single low-level alarm or rely on manual checks. The prototype will be put in a simulated as well as real-time environment to investigate endurance, accuracy, stability, longevity, reliability and ease of installation. Objectives include: (1) Find a solution/configuration to accurately monitor rapid level changes; (2) Verify the hardware can withstand harsh conditions (extreme temperatures, high vibration); (3) Software testing; and (4) Analyze different reservoirs to see how the product can be easily mounted.

    finding a practical and cost-effective protective cap for baseball pitchers susceptible
    to serious head injuries from impacts of batted baseballs. The new cap design
    satisfactorily addresses the shortcomings of previous commercialization efforts
    that were unable to meet the prescribed protective requirements; failed to pass
    both the players' fashion expectations and comfort evaluation; and carried a hefty
    purchase price. The acceptance and use of the new cap by professional baseball
    players will create widespread demand from collegiate, high school and Little
    League players, a market that is estimated to generate annual revenues of more
    than $18M. These market projections exclude consideration of the technology's
    Broader Impact potential in other sports or vocational and military applications,
    where there is a growing recognition of the need for improved head protection
    for athletes, soldiers, law enforcement officials and construction workers. Sports
    injuries are now highly scrutinized, especially those causing long-term medical
    issues from brain injury, blunt force trauma and repetitive concussive injury.
    The societal value of this innovation will be found in safer sports and work environments.
    Such equipment represents a rapidly growing segment of the apparel market and
    a unique commercial opportunity for the company. \n\nThe intellectual merit of
    this project is based on the company's patented design that provides head protection
    from the impact of a baseball. The novelty of the protective cap headliner is
    its flexible outer hard shell made with highly rigid interconnecting truncated
    icosahedron panels. This allows the headliner to conform to the shape of the head
    while maintaining the stiffness needed to diffuse impact loads.  Since the impact
    of a baseball represents a short duration point load, the energy-absorbing capacity
    of the layer beneath the outer shell can be minimized. The objective is to identify
    the material characteristics required to dissipate the impact load associated
    with a Severity Index of 1200 or greater when a head-form is struck by a baseball
    traveling at speeds up to 125 mph; and to identify the material combination(s)
    best suited to achieve this goal. Traditional foam materials as well as state-of-the-art
    material compositions will be used in unique configurations to produce solutions
    that are not too heavy, not too bulky nor too hot to wear. The outcomes of this
    study will determine the availability of materials that can be used within the
    ergonomic and mechanical constraints of the patented design to protect the head.\n\nThis

    will spur significant discovery in understanding dynamic reactions that occur
    in in vivo and in vitro microscopy. The initial target market has an estimated
    gross revenue of $75M. The technology also promises to benefit 3D imaging systems
    for manufacturing or machine vision, optical coherence tomography, and endoscopic
    imaging systems by providing high speed and agile focus control. While MEMS are
    ubiquitous in mobile platforms and the automotive industry for motion sensing,
    they have not yet permeated other markets or imaging systems to the same extent.
    With recent advances in fabrication and performance of optical MEMS devices, bringing
    this type of technology to other platforms can spark greater commercialization
    of the technology in non-traditional areas. \n\nThe intellectual merit of this
    project is foremost the demonstration of a novel optomechanical system with MEMS
    mirrors for independent control of focusing and zoom in microscopy. MEMS mirrors
    are a type of varifocus element. They remain stationary while their voltage-controlled,
    configurable surface shapes allow for fast focusing and attendant correction of
    spherical aberration. Fast MEMS mirrors, with sufficient diameters for 2x zoom
    and significant focusing capability, have not previously been demonstrated in
    literature or commercially. By producing and characterizing fast, large-diameter
    MEMS mirrors for this project, knowledge of varifocus elements will be advanced.
    This project will also continue to define standard optical design practices to
    best utilize varifocus elements, since traditional optical analyses assume fixed
    focal length lenses or mirrors. The project objectives are three-fold: 1) fabricate
    large-diameter MEMS mirrors with greater than 40% yield, 2) characterize their
    focusing range and dynamic behavior, and 3) demonstrate them in a focus and zoom
    system suitable as a microscopy add-on component.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to significantly increase the efficiency and reduce operating costs for water produced by membrane-based desalination.  Water scarcity is an increasingly important global-scale issue that has significant negative impacts on health, security and economies.  Recent forecasts show a dramatic increase in the number of countries that will soon be affected by water scarcity given that global water consumption is expected to significantly increase due to population growth.  Membrane-based water desalination, which at large scale requires a huge capital investment, is recognized as a primary technology that can significantly improve supply to meaningfully offset scarcity and its impacts.  A critical factor in desalination plant operations is energy consumption, which increases due to membrane fouling, thus making fouling one of the most significant factors controlling the efficiency of these plants.  The proposed in-situ, real-time sensing system can be the enabling technology to allow implementation of advanced plant control algorithms based upon accurate detection of fouling at its earliest stages.  Such active detection capability will enable the most effective implementation of fouling mitigation strategies that can be optimized to save energy and reduce cost.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a novel time-reversal waveguide sensor for detection of early-stage (ES) fouling in reverse osmosis (RO) membrane desalination, which is the dominant technology for desalinating brackish water and seawater.  Fouling in RO systems has inorganic (scaling) and organic (biofouling) components and can be a highly variable process that depends on operational parameters as well as environmental conditions.  Efficient implementation of real-time control of RO desalination for fouling mitigation requires real-time sensing.  The overall objective of the proposed work is to develop sophisticated ultrasonic sensor technology that can reliably detect scaling and biofouling in the challenging multi-layer, spiral-wound (SW) geometry of commercial-scale RO systems.  The proposed work will make use of time-reversal mirrors to produce a simple signal from a multi-mode waveguide independent of the geometry of the waveguide configuration, thus overcoming the exceedingly complex and difficult to interpret signals associated with the use of a standalone waveguide.  The goals of the project are to demonstrate the capability to detect both early-stage inorganic and organic fouling under realistic operating conditions, the reliability and the robustness of the technology, and the ability to adapt the technology to the larger size modules that are increasingly important for commercial operation.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project includes advancement of the field of white biotechnology, which utilizes enzymes to create valuable industrial products. As biological molecules, enzymes are more difficult to work with than conventional chemicals and often need more extensive development before they can be adapted to industrial or pharmaceutical manufacturing. This SBIR project will demonstrate how enzymes performance can be improved using stabilization with synthetic polymers. Enzymes are characterized by precise, unique structure and function, which is in turn essential for their role in catalysis of complex chemical reactions. Synthetic polymers, on the other hand, despite being less precisely structured, can be rationally designed to withstand or respond to chemical, thermal or biological conditions. The synergistic fusion of enzymes and synthetic polymers results in advanced nano-armored enzyme with improved properties such as solvent and temperature resistance, and modulated activity. Creating such novel stabilized enzymes will result in more efficient commercial utilization of enzymatic catalysis which requires less energy, utilizes less hazardous reagents, and generates less waste while generating valuable products such as chemicals, biofuels, and pharmaceuticals.

    This SBIR  Phase I project proposes to develop a combinatorial synthesis device that can feed high-throughput screening of enzyme-polymer conjugates with desired properties (for instance, temperature, pH- or organic solvent stability). To date, only low-throughput synthesis and characterization methods have been applied to the preparation of enzyme-polymer conjugates, limiting development to only few types of polymer modification per protein and depending on stochastic guesswork to select the variants tested. Thus, in order to fully benefit from the diverse set of polymers currently available on the market one has to consider methods of scaling the identification of optimally performing enzyme-polymer conjugates. This will be achieved through combination of high-throughput synthesis of enzyme-polymer conjugates and high-throughput screening of gained properties. The initial target application of the proposed research is focused on the industrial biocatalysis. Application of a high-throughput method will not only result in faster research and development cycles, but also will accelerate our development of fundamental knowledge of what kind of protein properties can be gained through polymer modification, thereby establishing this method for industrial applications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is in the development of novel water treatment technologies that can improve access to clean water and reduce the cost of water treatment. The innovation is a drop-in-replacement nanofiltration membrane that is chlorine-resistant, highly permeable, and uniquely customizable. The chlorine resistance allows for the continuous chlorination of the membrane, which can reduce bio-fouling and thereby increase the lifespan of a membrane; this has been a chief innovation target for more than 30 years. The customizability aspect also facilitates capture of lead and other heavy-metals, broadening the reach of nanofiltration membranes to sectors that generate significant amounts of wastewater, such as semiconductor, mining, pulp-and-paper, and colorant industries. These improvements to nanofiltration technology have clear and direct societal and economic impact by facilitating water reuse and offering clean and affordable water solutions. SBIR project funding is enabling the transition of this promising membrane technology from the laboratory setting into the early commercialization stages of a valuable new product.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to improve the commercial viability of novel nanofiltration membranes through the development of more-scalable and tunable synthesis and manufacturing protocols. The technology is based on self-assembling block copolymers with customizable chemical functionalities. Previous methods for the synthesis and casting of the polymers are not ideal, so new protocols are being developed. The changes to polymer and membrane manufacturing methods will be conducted systematically to develop new structure-property-performance relationships that will contribute new knowledge for broader membrane optimization efforts. A more thorough understanding of how polymer chemistry dictates membrane performance will also be cultivated by investing in the customization aspects of the technology. Finally, the performance characteristics of resulting nanofiltration membranes will be rigorously tested with respect to permeability, chlorine-resistance, separations, and heavy metal capture. The overall results will help advance nanofiltration membrane technology into a platform that is highly modular and can address a wider range of separations challenges than is currently possible.

    new way of using big data to maximize educational outcomes and the potential of
    each individual child.  The project will create individualized learning paths
    for every student that dynamically adjusts based on their abilities across thousands
    of educational topics.  The engine adjusts up to find their maximum potential
    regardless of age or grade, and adjusts down when they are struggling.  The simple,
    yet engaging, games combined with gamification elements will keep the child wanting
    to play over and over, constantly learning as they go.  The project will provide
    a tool to parents looking to enhance their child?s education as well as to those
    that prefer to homeschool.  It will also be a powerful teacher's assistant, able
    to monitor the progress of each child in the classroom so the teacher can better
    monitor and manage progress of their student base.   The Parent and Teacher Portals
    will connect the classroom and home learning experience and allow both parents
    and teachers to see how each child is performing and where they need to intervene
    to help.  Over time, the project will test and deploy new ways to learn. The potential
    commercial market for this product includes parents, homeschoolers, and teachers.
    \ The initial target market is kindergarten to 8th grade.  The project will improve
    education outcomes at these crucial ages. \n\nThe project uses patent-pending
    technology that combines a set of probabilistic engines to determine the right
    content for each student based on their individual ability.  It does not determine
    content based on their age or grade and makes no assumptions about what the student
    can or can?t do.  Instead, it allows the student to set their own limits and use
    Big Data to predict and test optimal learning paths.   The learning engine can
    work with any category of educational content and deliver that content dynamically
    to any type of game.  The project can measure the learning impact by making changes
    to the traditional learning paths within clusters of students.  It will uncover
    if, for example, fractions should be introduced earlier to all children, or subsets
    of children. As opposed to the option of skipping a grade or being held back,
    a student doing well (or poorly) could be in the same class with their peers and
    still have unique content that challenges them and maximizes their natural abilities.
    \  The learning engine will use business intelligence techniques to identify problem
    areas for each child and recommend what to practice and practice techniques.  The
    project team has previously received patents on technology in the gaming industry,
    and is confident in the ability to receive a utility patent for this technology
    for intellectual property protection."

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) project is to produce polymer composites that enable commercialization
    of alkaline electrochemical devices, such fuel cells and electrolyzers. The use
    of fuel cell technologies will help preserve the environment, mitigate climate
    change, decreasing our carbon footprint and securing renewable energy supply.
    Electrolyzers are an increasingly attractive method of producing ultrapure hydrogen,
    an essential chemical feedstock and fuel. Currently, widespread adoption of these
    technologies is prevented by the high system costs, which are driven by the platinum
    catalysts. Operating under alkaline conditions with alkaline exchange membranes
    (AEMs) is necessary to relieve this pain point by allowing the use non-precious
    metal catalysts (e.g. stainless steel, nickel, cobalt, and their alloys). Moreover,
    AEMs will be less expensive to produce and recyclable at the end of lifetime,
    unlike the existing polymer electrolytes, further decreasing the cost of devices.
    Producing commercially viable AEMs enables the widespread deployment of fuel cell
    and electrolyzer systems by making the technology economically competitive with
    incumbent fossil fuel based energy sources.  \n\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes
    to produce polymer electrolyte composites that meet the stringent performance
    criteria for a commercially viable AEM, including durability, hydroxide conductivity
    and mechanical strength under alkaline operating conditions. A proprietary polymer
    composition with unprecedented chemical stability will be incorporated into microporous
    polymer structural supports. Typically, cation percentage in AEMs must be kept
    low, otherwise the membranes swell excessively and deteriorate during operation.
    Incorporating polymers into structural supports permits increased cation concentration
    and ion exchange capacity (IEC), resulting in AEMs with high hydroxide conductivity.
    Furthermore, the mechanical strength of the composite is determined by the support
    and is not reduced by high IEC, like unsupported membranes. A polymerization method
    will be employed that allows fine control over cation concentration and the reaction
    can be conducted inside the support, simplifying composite fabrication. The combination
    of our unique polymer composition and a structural support that maximizes conductivity
    without losing mechanical strength, is a crucial milestone for the commercialization
    of our technology."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to develop smart software to plan and control Electric Vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure in commercial facilities, such as workplaces, hotels, car rental centers, parking garages, etc. The EV planning software finds the optimal design balancing design tradeoffs such as EV customer satisfaction, grid stability limits and financial constraints. This software will help facility operators to optimize their EV charging infrastructure by minimizing their operating costs and maximizing their revenue by utilizing intelligent scheduling and pricing strategies. The software leverages the latest developments in stochastic optimization for designing an optimal configuration of EV infrastructure that is robust to variations in mobility behavior of the users. This will enable public utilities to save billions of dollars by deferring expensive upgrades to their existing infrastructure. It will also empower small consulting businesses, facility managers and electrical contractors to design and build EV infrastructure without any specialized knowledge of optimization or modeling.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project addresses the problem of planning and controlling EV charging infrastructure to meet the rapidly growing energy demands of EV owners. EVs are expected to comprise 30% of all cars globally by 2030. This forecasted increase over the next 10 years is of major concern for utilities, and commercial real estate owners. Given the long commute distances, driving habits, time taken to charge using home-based chargers and range anxiety, there is a need for charging locations at workplaces, hotels, and car rental centers. Chargers at these locations will generally be medium power Level 2 chargers, which are 5 to 10 times the size of typical home chargers. Simultaneous uncontrolled charging of several EVs at these locations will easily overload the local electrical infrastructure. The software mitigates this problem by designing an optimal EV infrastructure together with optimally sized onsite generation and storage. The controlling solution ensures that the grid impacts are minimized by scheduling the installed EV chargers together with onsite generation and storage with optimal set points in real time.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to ultimately increase the number of women in STEM careers, thus allowing women to secure higher paying jobs and to expand global innovation by increasing the number of women who are inventing future technologies. Research demonstrates a direct connection between play and academic pursuits, yet few STEM products appeal to the 10MM+ pre-adolescent U.S. girls.  Our hypothesis is that by designing an Internet of Things (IoT) platform of interactive decor building kits with motion and lighting features, we can engage girls in hands-on STEM learning during a formative time in their emotional and intellectual development. The kits will offer educational and exploratory opportunities including spatial and sequential thinking, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and programming. The user guides and on-line learning modules will be authored and designed to create and build a STEM identity in girls. Our theory is that this hands-on experience will create attitudinal and identity shifts in girls to motivate them to pursue additional STEM academic opportunities and further their exploration with other STEM activities.

    The proposed project is a method to provide an entrance to STEM experiences for a population typically not recognizing their strengths and abilities in the STEM areas. This is accomplished by leading them through an IoT modular product platform to build personalizable decor accessories as they pursue their interest in decorating and the arts.  The proposed project?s objectives are: (1) design and build a hardware prototype; (2) design and build an app prototype; (3) design and conduct research to determine that interaction with the proposed IoT modular platform results in an attitudinal shift toward STEM. The project will employ research methods including a large scale learning styles survey (400 users); moderated and recorded user feedback sessions, and in-person studies (15 users) using questionnaires adapted from published research and academic assessments.  Our success parameters are: (1) 50% of users can build and program the IoT product; (2) 20% of girls experience an increase in STEM areas; (3) 15% improvement in short-term recall of STEM skills and vocabulary; (4) 25% of users report an interest in trying another STEM experience; (5) 50% of users report they would display completed product in their room.

    a disk jockey (DJ) musician's instrument for synchronizing digital media data
    to a specific location on a device and using this technology for inspiring and
    educating middle and high school students in Science, Technology, Engineering,
    Art, and Mathematics (STEAM). Global expanding markets for DJ gear, a $1.587B
    dollar growth industry, over the past 3 years grew in sales by 21%. As technology
    and entertainment converge, DJs represent the new \"Superstar\" for today's youth.
    Thus, this research represents an incentivizing gateway for students to learn
    how math, engineering and science intellectual assets can contribute to musical
    and artistic innovation. Additionally, middle and/or junior high school students'
    analysis of the data derived from a performance and entertainment-related technology
    can be an incentivizing and engaging entrance into STEM academic subjects such
    as systems design, acoustics, and computer coding.  Given the DJ tool's relation
    to these topics as well as music's inherent link with physics and math, its integration
    into the curriculum of after-school programming options are expected to foster
    more interdisciplinary STEM learning. Afterschool turntable academies as thematic
    contexts for STEM learning function as supportive and assistive educational venues.
    Collectively, the broader impact of this project should produce economic competitiveness
    in the music/technology industry for the U.S. overall and, specifically for youth,
    enhanced engagement in STEM fields.\n \nThe intellectual merit of this project
    stems from the necessity for individuals to seamlessly interface with the digital
    world without losing creativity, artistry or individuality. The technical innovation
    emerges from determining the coordinate location of an analog audio occurrence,
    tracking the change in occurrences, and matching it to a digital counterpart to
    follow the changes created. The sensor data points are utilized to metamorphose
    the turntable, the musical instrument of the DJ, into a complete analog/digital
    educational tool. This technology can offer critical insights to STEM learning
    and educational opportunities to students who may feel that STEM concepts or careers
    are separate from their personal interests and cultural context. Anticipated outcomes
    include advancements in the arts, sciences and education by contributing to entertainment's
    most recent and broadly recognized musical instrument and making it more available
    in middle and high school STEM educational curricula and after school activities.
    The proposed research intends to investigate, identify and resolve current liabilities
    connected with the transient acoustic degradation, deleterious latency introduction,
    and physical performance loss by systems intended to mimic the analog turntable.
    The research objective will be to create novel interface models to analyze the
    elements captured from the DJ musician and translate these into a commercially
    and educationally viable platform."

    Phase I project is the improved identification of young children who may be at
    risk for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Autism is a growing concern as rates
    continue to increase, however many experts in child development are hopeful that
    early intervention can help reduce many of the challenges of living with autism.
    \ As the brain undergoes important critical periods of development in the first
    year of life, it is important to try and identify opportunities for intervention
    as early as infancy. However, infants have limited means to express themselves
    and it can be difficult for parents and even pediatricians to track the subtle
    behavioral cues that can be indicative of autism at this early age.  The goal
    of this proposal is to improve access to tools that help make infants developing
    thinking and social skills more observable to pediatricians and parents. By creating
    a consumer version of an old technique used by psychologists to understand infant
    development, this work will increase access to tools to track infants' behaviors
    related to autism.  \n\nThe proposed project is novel in its repurposing of an
    established laboratory psychology tool, the nonnutritive sucking paradigm. Basically,
    psychologists long ago learned that infants will alter their rate of sucking on
    a pacifier when they are interested in something. Psychologists recorded from
    a pacifier to gauge what an infant was interested in as well as an infant's growing
    understanding of language, social interaction, math, and a wide variety of cognitive
    and social skills. They also allowed infants to control the presentation of sounds
    or images through their sucking patterns. This SBIR project is creating a more
    accessible version of this established smart pacifier technique to allow parents
    and pediatricians to also better track an infant?s interest, preferences, and
    social and cognitive development. This effort will develop a consumer friendly
    smart pacifier that can control sounds or images on software or mobile applications.
    By designing software that replicates the social and cognitive assessment paradigms
    in psychology laboratories, the smart pacifier system can increase access to objective
    behavioral assessment tools. Similar to growing evidence in eye-tracking behavior,
    this behavioral assessment tool can be used to better assess behaviors that have
    been linked to the future development of autism."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to transform the life experiences of youth patients in the Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) community by providing an affordable, comprehensive mobile platform for monitoring health behaviors, tracking biometrics, fostering self-empathy/empowerment, and developing healthy diabetes self-management practices (DSM) through a gamified app. Adherence to DSM behaviors is an exacting issue with conventional T1D treatment and prevention regimens, though the use of features found in gaming technologies has been shown to be motivating in apps for chronic illnesses. Data-tracking applications meant for public health are believed to yield hidden trends on diet, fitness, mood, and compliance in both individuals and populations, identifying behavioral patterns that may be useful for positive behavior change. With a far-reaching and accessible intervention leveraging the motivational power of games, empathy, and social interaction, health professionals can use this intervention to encourage long-term engagement with data-tracking, which in turn creates rich data sets for tapping into the unseen trends of T1D experiences, contributing to the growing body of T1D knowledge, enriching T1D youth's quality of life, and streamline patient-provider communications in a cost-effective way that benefits the health care system as a whole.

    The proposed project aims to provide a better understanding of the affordances of digital technologies in DSM, with emphases on the role of technology as a facilitator of diabetes education, DSM, patient-provider communications, emotional wellness, social and cognitive development, and positive behavior change. T1D diagnoses represent more than 175,000 youth in the United States, and despite significant headway in other areas of mobile health, many families struggle to access T1D tools that dramatically improve the quality of life and health outcomes of their children. To meet this demand, the objectives of this research begin with engineering a full-featured youth-facing prototype¯starring an empathetic virtual pet¯capable of collecting multiple streams of user data and teaching via instructional modules. Data collected during usability studies with stakeholders in the diabetes community will provide insight into effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction of users, while a feasibility study also employing interviews, surveys, and think aloud protocols will offer insight into the practical use of the app in everyday life over a weeklong period. After both of these studies have been conducted, transcripts of recorded sessions and log file data will be analyzed, with the goal of improving the feasibility of extended product usage and success.

    individual interests, purposes, and abilities. Even though robust research demonstrates
    both intrinsic motivation to read and print book ownership strongly shape reading
    achievement, few existing educational software products address them. The project

    in very low income schools through partnerships with non-profits. Together, these
    offerings will tap a combined U.S. children's book and literacy educational software
    market for grades 2-5 that tops $1.4 billion dollars annually. Unlike most other
    \"personalized\" or \"adaptive\" learning systems, the app will use machine learning
    and artificial intelligence to increase the agency of students and teachers. It
    will focus on helping students improve their ability to make their own choices
    rather than making those choices for them.  \n\nThe intellectual merit of this

    the task increasingly effectively and independently over multiple performances.
    The voice conversational interface will provide this combined task support and
    coaching through an emotionally engaging narrative experience accessible to struggling
    readers. The research will yield a field-tested prototype of the system, constructing
    a domain model, authoring conversational content, developing machine learning
    technology, and iteratively improving the system through usability and pilot testing
    in elementary school classrooms. Technical challenges include tuning automated
    voice recognition in naturalistic classroom environments, overcoming the cold
    start problem to generate high quality initial recommendations, and supporting
    acquisition of both cognitive and metacognitive skills within an ill-structured

    This SBIR phase I project will develop new reagents to enable cell separation and analysis. Cell separation is a $3.9 billion/yr market with applications in medicine, pharmaceutical, and biological research industries. However, many current schemes perform cell separation and analysis in separate steps. A single reagent that could perform both functions would save time and money, enhancing these industries. The nanoparticle reagent developed by this research possesses magnetic properties to enable cell separation, and fluorescent properties that allow properties of separated cells to be quantified. This research will optimize this product and demonstrate proof-of-concept against the current standard approaches. The proposed product is the result of basic research previously funded by the NSF into methods to combine magnetic and fluorescent reagents, and optimization of this reagent will yield basic knowledge in manufacture and scale-up of these nanomaterials. Successful completion of these goals will lead to a new product that will enable cell separation and analysis with a single reagent, enabling cell separation with high purity and increasing signal used for quantification. These benefits could translate into reduced laboratory healthcare costs with increased diagnostic efficiency, improved pharmaceutical purity, and high tech nanomanufacturing jobs in this burgeoning industry.

    This research will develop magnetic-fluorescent nanoparticle reagents to enable seamless cell separation and subsequent flow cytometry analysis. Cell separation is often performed with magnetic reagents that enable high throughput; however, analysis of the separated product is performed in a separate step, typically via flow cytometry. The use of large magnetic beads for separation prevents analysis, as the beads employed are much larger than the protein quantified. Even if small nanoparticles are used, a separate reagent is required for analysis, and signal is limited as the same receptors are targeted for both separation and analysis steps. Thus, a reagent that could perform both separation and analysis steps would improve performance. This research will optimize nanoparticle reagents that enable separation and analysis and compare their performance to the current approach using two separate reagents. Thus, this research will demonstrate crucial proof-of-concept of these reagents that are manufactured using a scalable process, enabling rapid transition to beta testing and follow-on commercialization.

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to provide clinical decision support software
    that assists inpatient providers in improving care for preventable acute inpatient
    harms, and thereby reduce mortality and morbidity. This grant develops a cloud-based
    platform that applies machine learning (ML) algorithms in real-time on data extracted
    from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and physiologic monitoring devices attached
    to a patient. The ML tools employed estimate the degree of reliability for each
    of the data elements as they are collected and integrates these signals to provide
    an accurate, individualized risk estimate of patient health over time in order
    to best guide patient treatment and allocation of hospital resources. Our initial
    target condition is sepsis, one of the most costly and most deadly diseases in
    hospitals. This grant develops an end-to-end system to provide risk assessment
    and implementation of timely treatment. For commercial potential, the underlying
    core technology can be extended to other clinical scenarios. \n\nThe proposed
    project enables scaling of high-precision state-of-the-art Bayesian machine learning
    techniques that forecast the chance of acute deterioration. This includes tackling
    the challenges in scaling this machine learning system to function across many
    care providers, patients, and hospitals. To achieve these goals, this project
    will develop new methods for running machine learning algorithms in a distributed
    fashion in cloud computing settings, especially in distinguishing where multiple
    machines need to coordinate, and arguably more importantly, where they can avoid
    coordinating in training on data. Further, the project develops software to provide
    information back to providers so as to enable interventions that can alter patient
    trajectory. Here the software will encompass how to best use the resulting inferences
    in guiding care."

    Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is in automating the process of unbiased stereology,
    the state-of-the-method used in the life sciences for counting stained cells on
    tissue sections.  Unbiased stereology allows neuroscientists to accurately analyze
    the size and number of brain cells, which are altered in many neurological disorders
    and mental illnesses. For reasons that are currently unknown, Alzheimer's disease,
    Parkinson's disease and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis are all associated with
    a progressive loss of brain cells. In contrast, children with autism are born
    with too many brain cells, which leads to life-long problems in processing complex
    streams of information.  Stereology plays an important role in investigating many
    conditions affecting the brain and assessing the efficacy and safety of possible
    treatments. Though the proposed technology will initially target research studies
    to understand and treat all neurological conditions, it can be useful for automatic
    assessments of cells in all tissues, including cancer screening and diagnosis
    from biopsies. \n\n\nThe proposed project will develop and optimize an algorithm
    to help brain scientists identify causes and treatments for neurological disease
    and mental illness. The proposed technology will use deep learning (artificial
    intelligence) systems to automatically recognize, count and size brain cells on
    tissue sections. An important use of this technology will be to analyze brains
    and nerve tissue from mice and rats treated to show similar neurological diseases

    treatments to cure brain disease in humans. Currently stereology studies of tissues
    from these animals require a trained technician to sit before a computer screen

    outdated approach fails to take advantage of powerful deep learning methods proposed
    for the proposed software that could complete these tasks 10 times faster and
    with fewer errors and human biases. Therefore, the proposed technology will use
    deep learning technology to accelerate basic research and drug development in

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project includes education of water engineering processes and training for success in the advanced technology economy and workforce. Plant Control will teach students the system that supplies safe drinking water to their schools and homes while applying chemistry and engineering concepts in an engaging format. Student exposure to engineering in high school is correlated to choice of STEM majors in college. The product will introduce students to a wide range of disciplines including civil, electrical, mechanical, biological, and materials to promote student choice of engineering majors. The disruption of clean drinking water in Flint, MI highlights the critical importance of safe drinking water and technical hurdles that an aging utility infrastructure presents. Water quality STEM concepts presented in this product are essential for a voting population to make local and federal decisions related to population growth and aging utility infrastructure. High School STEM classrooms are centers of innovation for students. This product will provide the students a sand-box tool to develop their own control and data acquisition as well as train them in software that is widely used in the controls and data acquisition industry.

    The proposed project will develop a simulation and remote plant model intended to engage students in a new context and compliment STEM engineering curriculum in K-12 environments. The goals of the research are to understand the effect of simulation learning tools on STEM education, to develop a simulator for educational and workforce training purposes, and to develop a programming tool to enable student and maker applications of control and data acquisition systems that is currently lacking in that market. Simulation development technical hurdles include flow modeling in a wide-range of student defined configurations, equipment and filtration media. The simulation developed in this project will be further applied in the water and wastewater market to train plant operators for standard and emergency plant operation conditions. The web-accessible remote plant model component of the project requires connectivity of nationwide users to the remote plant and protection of the physical plant equipment. The development platform used for control of the plant will be available to the students for modification and use in their own projects. The student-version will require a limited and simplified version of the professional platform currently available. Development of the student version will require platform reconfiguration and user capability modification.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to enable the discovery of needed antibody therapeutics in diseases for which there are no available treatments. These therapies act by increasing or decreasing the activity of a type of cell signaling receptor, "G protein-coupled receptors" (GPCRs). Antibodies are highly specific for their targets, an important characteristic for GPCR drugs, as GPCRs comprise a large family of structurally similar proteins.  In fact, small molecule drugs for GPCRs often are toxic due to side effects from acting on structurally similar but functionally unrelated GPCRs. This project will develop the first technology that directly identifies antibodies by their ability to modulate GPCR function. These antibodies will impact society's health by treating currently incurable diseases, and strongly impact scientific understanding by enabling the study of GPCR-related mammalian physiology and disease. The commercial impacts are potentially very large. The global GPCR drug market is over $100B, and over half of marketed antibody therapeutics have annual sales of over $1B. The platform described here has the potential to develop many GPCR antibody therapeutics, and thereby generate an enormous amount of value for patients, society at large, and co-development partners.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a platform for discovering GPCR-modulating antibodies. This platform could be critical for generating tools for studying GPCR-related biology and disease, and for developing therapeutics with fewer side effects than small molecule drugs to treat GPCR-related diseases. Developing functional GPCR antibodies using traditional methods is encumbered by the difficulty in producing antigens that represent the GPCR in a functional state, and a lack of high-throughput assays of GPCR function. The proposed platform and method expresses human GPCRs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast, couples activity to selectable phenotypes, and directly selects antibodies that modulate GPCR function in the same cells. The first objective aims to further characterize the activity and specificity of camelid antibodies ("nanobodies") antagonists that inhibit the endogenous yeast GPCR, Ste2, and then perform agonist selections to identify at least one Ste2 agonist. The second objective aims to further develop the platform to enable interrogating a broader array of human GPCR targets using ScFv antibody libraries, and to identify at least one agonist or antagonist of a therapeutically relevant human GPCR. Positive results will demonstrate the feasibility of the platform.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to use current research in the learning sciences to develop games that make middle school math engaging and relevant.  Middle school is a crucial time in a student's educational journey as it is the period at which their self-concept of ability becomes stable. Studies show that it is also the period at which students start getting disengaged with math and there is a marked increase in negativity towards math from sixth to eighth grade. According to the National Report Card, only about a third of 8th graders in US public schools, of over 3.6 million students, score at the proficient or above level in Math every year. The goal of this proposal is to implement and test the effectiveness of a scaffolded learning and teaching environment, called the 'Teachpad', that helps middle school students learn difficult math concepts. Multiple studies have indicated that students put more effort into learning when they have to teach someone else. This project will extend these studies and evaluate whether the teachpad increases student engagement and improves learning and long term retention of difficult math concepts.

    The proposed project uses a "teach to learn" framework in which students teach characters in a computer game how to solve specific problems and use the feedback that they receive from the characters to evaluate how well they have understood the concepts themselves. The teachpad uses natural language input, meaning that the students can enter their instruction in plain English and can explain the solution to the problem as they would to a friend or sibling. A semantic parser extracts the useful information from this input and feeds it to a machine learning algorithm to teach a game character how to solve the problem. A model of what the character has learned is also visible to the student who can see how their instruction is working when the character is trying to solve a test problem. This project will implement the teachpad for the order of operations, and will determine how it compares to traditional classroom practices. Data will be  collected in authentic educational environments, through observations and interviews to study student engagement and usability, and pretests and posttests (once after the treatment and once when students return from summer break) to evaluate learning outcomes and long term retention.

    The broader impact/ commercial potential of this project is to commercialize previous research in tensegrity robots for new markets in disaster rescue, surveillance, scientific monitoring, and STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) education. Future deaths by both victims and first responders in disaster rescue in unchartered risky environments could be prevented by utilizing semi-autonomous technology to explore the regions of disasters, provide surveillance to inform first responders, and assist in the rescue of victims until human first responders can arrive. Current autonomous vehicles can be ineffective in navigating surface obstacles and climbing steep slopes to reach areas of interest. Aerial operations may be limited to dropping supplies, which may not be beneficial if victims are immobile or unconscious. The goal is to drop the proposed shape-shifting robots from aerial vehicles, so that these mobile robots can reach previously difficult areas for effective emergency response. This proposed technology will have broader impact in use for scientific monitoring and surveillance as well. A secondary market will be for K-12 students, teachers, parents and roboticists with the potential to have large impact in STEM education.  Robot kits will be developed for educational applications that will meet new Next Generation Science Standards.

    The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will focus on de-risking prior research in the development of spherical tensegrity structures as a robotic platform for the proposed target applications. To meet market needs, the specifications need to include impact testing from a drop from an aerial vehicle along with ground travel requirements of slope, rubble and speed. New hardware and software will be designed to meet these specifications. The following three control algorithms and actuation schemes will be developed and evaluated for target specifications and tested in simulation and in hardware for locomotion (1) Multi-cable rolling motion on inclined surfaces, (2) Dynamic rolling using Model Predictive Control (MPC), and (3) Deep reinforcement learning. For applications where the terrain has been mapped, a (4) Generative path-planning algorithm will be developed. (5) Control mechanisms for the internal sphere of the robot will be developed so that the tensegrity robot will be able to manipulate and orient a payload of sensing equipment (e.g., camera, ultrasound, infrared, laser, spectrometer) while traveling on rough terrain. (6) Associated sensor validation, fusion and estimation techniques will be developed to meet the specifications. The results will be a proof-of-concept prototype that meets the target specifications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable students and trainees to take state-of-the-art robotics laboratory classes from anywhere in the world. The proposed learning system is aimed to be incorporated as online courses, with the potential of being attended by more than a million students. The addressable market represents hundreds of millions of dollars considering online courses, secondary schools and industrial training. Laboratory courses in colleges and high schools require students to be physically present next to the equipment. With the proposed remote robotics laboratory, students and trainees can take laboratory classes just turning on their mobile devices or computers. Most importantly, the students can conduct the laboratory tutorials anywhere across the globe and at any time. This technology can be transformative for accessing expensive laboratory equipment not present in many institutions or companies. The system we provide consists of a robotic device currently being used inside NASA robots. Therefore, students using the remote laboratory will learn the use of real-world, state-of-the-art equipment that can be highly valuable for their job careers in STEM fields.

    The proposed project will solve two key problems in online learning. First, no known commercially available laboratory online course exists that provides students remote hands-on experimentation. The second is that the same content is delivered to all students regardless of their current understanding level. Distributed communications, robotic software and web framework technologies will be integrated to provide access to state-of-the-art laboratory equipment. The second key innovation is the delivery of content adaptively tailored to individual needs. The innovation, consists of three key components. A web framework that connects equipment to servers and personal mobile devices, an intelligent content tutoring system, scheduling usage times and student evaluation regarding skill acquisition and assessments. The team anticipates that being remotely located will be slightly less effective than being next to the equipment but superior than learning theory only.

    ability to parallel process -- to create a psychographic profile of the player's
    career-critical characteristics, including traits like competitiveness, extroversion,
    risk tolerance, and other enduring, personal traits difficult to discern through
    resumes and traditional, college application materials. Once a student's career

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop an easy to use internet-of-things (IoT) platform, called "Bluebird", for use in K-12 Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) education. This project will employ a craft-oriented approach to STEM education, which breaks down gender barriers and engages students from diverse backgrounds.  It is estimated that 65% of primary school children will grow up to work in jobs that do not yet exist. This new workforce will be the result of what is being referred to as the "fourth industrial revolution", brought on by a fusion of technologies in the physical, digital, and biological spheres. The goal of this project is to develop an ecosystem of IoT technologies that prepare students for these industries. The platform to be developed will disrupt the current commercial landscape by providing an affordable and student-friendly alternative to devices which are either expensive or overly challenging for beginners to adopt.  The resulting product platform will serve the global smart education and learning market, which is expected to grow to $586 billion by 2021.

    The intellectual merit of this project is to develop a "smart" education tool that will enable educators and learners to control the ways in which technology shapes their lives. This innovation will eliminate the major hurdles that create conceptual, practical, and economic barriers for students to gain literacy of information networks and human-centered design.  To achieve this goal, the team will research and develop a platform and an easy-to-use device that overcomes the technical challenges of providing IoT experiences in the classroom, where wireless internet is often unreliable, and the security and privacy of students must be safeguarded.  The key objectives for this project are 1) to develop a classroom-ready framework for IoT including curriculum that adheres to educational mandates; 2) to design and build low-cost and low-power hardware, firmware, and protocols for the platform; and 3) to design and implement a mobile application to facilitate communications and programming.  The anticipated result of this research is a platform that provides K-12 classroom access to IoT tools and skills. The design and manufacture of this project opens up a new market as Bluebird users craft their own IoT ideas, products, and services.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project will be the development of sensor-embedded "smart" drinkware (i.e., stirrers, straws and cups) to actively alert consumers prior to consumption of a "spiked" beverage, and thus provide a proactive way to prevent drug-facilitated sexual assault.  This sensor technology is based on "smart" molecularly imprinted color-changing nanomaterials that eliminate the need to run tedious sample preparation and analysis procedures using conventional laboratory instrument.  The use of a colorimetric sensor as a cost-effective consumer sensor has far broader applications than just date rape drug detection, including applications where on-the-spot detection could help protect consumers from other harmful chemicals, pathogens, drugs, explosives, nerve agents, allergens, etc. In addition, this project will advance colorimetric sensing technology using structural color into a robust and rapid sensing platform for drug monitoring with high sensitivity, response time, and accuracy.


    This STTR Phase I project proposes to develop a platform technology based on a highly accurate, color-changing sensor that will initially be used to continuously monitor a beverage for date rape drugs, and instantaneously detect these adulterants if they are present. Drug-facilitated sexual assault has become a significant issue, but there is currently no drug-sensing drinkware available on the market. This drug sensor will be implemented using highly selective molecular imprinted polymers as target drug receptors and non-toxic color-changing nanomaterials as signaling reporters. The scope of the research includes the rational design of the color-changing nanomaterial used as a signaling reporter for the target drug binding event, the development of a highly selective molecularly imprinted polymer and its integration with reporters, and the testing of the color-changing sensor under different matrices and conditions to verify its sensitivity and specificity.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve the lives of over 500,000 patients with end stage renal disease receiving thrice-weekly hemodialysis treatments in the US each year.  Hemodialysis requires the blood of a patient to be removed and passed through a filter for cleaning prior to returning it to the patient. Oftentimes patients receive insufficient dialysis treatments because the traditional blood pathways cannot be effectively sustained. This leads to increased infections, hospitalization rates and deaths. In addition to the unnecessary suffering of patients, the cost of maintaining these blood pathways is over $2B annually. This implantable device will improve our technical and scientific understanding of hemodialysis shortcomings and may lead to advancing the knowledge in medical fields related to arterial and venous access.  This innovation will allow enhanced hemodialysis treatments for this vulnerable patient population by maintaining blood pathways and lowering infection rates.

    The proposed project is to create a vascular access device which ensures that end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients have reliable vascular access without the need for an arterialized venous system. AV fistulas and AV grafts often fail to mature and are associated with suboptimal long-term patency rates resulting in a loss of the patient?s life line to dialysis. The objective would be to create a completely subcutaneous device which can be anastomosed to an artery and a separate vein such that the arterial device can obtain a blood flow of at least 400ml/min and the venous device can return the dialyzed blood at a rate of at least 400 ml/min.  The device must allow blood flow through its lumen only when needed and return the native vasculature to its normal flow state after each use. The technical difficulty is how to configure the mechanics of the device and its anastomosis to blood vessels in a manner which allows it to be opened and closed on demand without causing thromboses to form within the native vessels or device. We will be using computational fluid dynamic modeling and an iterative design process to achieve our prototype.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project will be to develop engineered bacteria with the ability to oxidize the copper mineral chalcopyrite and gold.  The majority of copper reserves are in chalcopyrite, which currently requires smelting.  The US copper mining industry, due to regulatory restrictions, has a limited smelting capacity forcing US copper manufacturers to ship copper mineral concentrates overseas for smelting, which incurs additional transportation and processing costs while losing up to 30% of the full value of the metal to the smelters. At over 400,000 tons of copper concentrate exported annually, this amounts to over $600M in lost value.  In gold mining, biooxidation is increasingly used before other gold recovery techniques are utilized, and increased oxidation rates would expand the use and significantly lower the capital and operating costs of this practice.  In addition, enhanced oxidation would accelerate the development of mining waste streams as biotechnology feedstocks.  This project potentially furthers more economical and sustainable biohydrometallurgical techniques throughout the mining industry.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes the demonstration and development of new oxidation activity within bioleaching microbes, expanding the applications of biohydrometallurgy in metal mining. This would permit the application of cheaper, low impact biohydrometallurgical methods for important metal minerals. Currently, biohydrometallurgy is limited by its reliance on ferric iron as the main oxidant. The Intellectual Merit of this proposal stems from the use of hydrogen peroxide, which can enable mineral oxidation conversions and rates that are not obtainable with ferric iron alone. Adding hydrogen peroxide to biohydrometallurgy operations is not feasible or cost effective, however, the genetic engineering of biomining microbes, such as A. ferrooxidans, to produce hydrogen peroxide would be a potentially game changing advance. This innovation will result in the production of biomining microbial cells with an unprecedented ability to dissolve sulfide-rich ores leading to the expansion of biohydrometallurgical approaches in the mining industry.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the first time commercial development of a copper cable which can transmit and store energy. Currently, copper cables are used for transmitting electricity. Adding energy storage capability to these cables is transformative and has the potential to be employed in a myriad of electrical and electronic applications. Making these cables into spools of wires and custom sliced into a certain length to achieve a required capacitance will be very attractive to commercial applications. The proposed study enables to understand how energy transmission and storage can be simultaneously performed without mutual interference. These cables can find niche applications in the automotive, energy, defense, and IT industries. Moreover, when made into thin wires, it can be weaved into a matrix which can be used to charge wearable devices. For example, currently, a soldier carries about 30-40 pounds of battery for a three-day mission. However, if energy storage devices like the one proposed here can be made into an advanced textile form and can be worn as a uniform, the weight currently carried by the soldiers can be considerably reduced. A cable energy storage device developed can also be beneficial for storing energy for clean-energy technologies such as wind and solar.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project fills the gap of a cable-type capacitor which saves space and fits well with electrical and electronic devices. The objective of this proposal is to use nanotechnology-based fabrication techniques to grow nanowhiskers with a high surface area on a copper cable to make cable-type capacitors. These nanostructures considerably enhance the surface area necessary for the storage of electrical charges. Since nanostructures are developed only on the outside of the electrical cable to store energy, the inner part of the cable can still be used for electrical transmission. The focus of the proposed research is to develop the processes which can be used to make these nanostructured electrodes into a cable capacitor. The fabrication techniques for growing nanostructures will be so designed that making long lengths of the cables are feasible. The performance of the cable-based capacitors will be tested in terms of capacitance, cycle life, voltage output, etc. In addition, the flexibility of the cable will be tested at different bend-angles to evaluate its applications in flexible energy storage applications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to enable drones to autonomously fly close to both outdoor and indoor infrastructure and assets, such as bridges, tunnels, buildings and warehouse goods, and to inspect them without relying on human pilots, external markers, and availability and reliability of data from a Global Positioning System (GPS). Many assets, such as bridges and warehouses, require drones to fly in GPS-denied environments making it impossible for existing systems to do localization and perform autonomous flights. The proposed technology will allow for faster, more frequent and thorough, less expensive and safer inspections, enhancing public confidence in the use of transportation assets. The proposed technology will also reduce the number of injuries caused by manual inspections, because of personnel having to access hard-to-reach or dangerous locations, lowering insurance and health care costs. Federal and state resources that would have been spent on inspection and maintenance could then be reallocated to other initiatives. In the case of bridge inspection, the proposed technology will eliminate the need for costly lane and bridge closures. The global opportunity to create savings, enhance safety and reduce externalities in infrastructure and warehouse inspection markets by using autonomous drone technology is substantial.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will involve developing an onboard, autonomous and reliable Advanced Perceptive Navigation system for drones to perform bridge, warehouse and other infrastructure and asset inspection by flying close to assets under challenging conditions including GPS-denied environments. Existing drone technology heavily relies on GPS data and drones can only be safely flown tens, if not hundreds, of meters away from the asset due to lack of precise control by human pilots and lack of positional accuracy of commercial autopilots. Such distances are inadequate for many situations, which require high-resolution imagery. The proposed solution will not rely on a global geographic frame of reference, but instead sense and perceive features of the asset that will allow the drone to navigate and optimally position itself with respect to the asset to collect images. Robust and computationally efficient algorithms will be developed, to be run onboard in real-time, for object detection, feature extraction and reliable tracking of points of interest from cameras and depth sensors mounted on drones. Developed algorithms will be integrated with the actual drone platform, and indoor test flights as well as field testing will be performed.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project include enabling the minimally invasive treatment of a large variety of conditions. This is expected to be achieved through the development of a steerable needle that can reach arbitrary positions in the human body that are not reachable by a straight needle from a simple needle hole. The long term impact of the proposed technology is in targeted delivery of medicine, or the removal of tissue such as biopsies, or treatment mechanisms such as ablation devices. An overarching goal of the proposed project is the availability of minimally invasive procedures that can replace more drastic surgery options. The development of this device has the potential to also save lives, treating what otherwise would be inoperable conditions due to the location of tumors blocked by sensitive organs or bones.


    The proposed project, if successful, will lead to demonstrating the application of a device that utilizes the buckling behavior of semi-curved beams to controllably alter the stiffness in a needle for cancer treatment and measure its efficacy in terms of the advantages over straight needles. The objectives of this research include: developing a prototype and match to surgeon use cases (interventional radiologist) and testing and characterizing the steerability performance while delivering the medical payload. Specifically, it is expected that the first therapeutic application of this technology will be microwave ablation of cancer tumors.

    This STTR Phase I project will develop 3D printed liquid hydrogen fuel tanks for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). UAVs are currently powered by long endurance low reliability gasoline engines, or short endurance highly reliable electric propulsion. Hydrogen fuel cells offer the potential for long endurance highly reliable propulsion if the proper hydrogen storage method is used. Through the innovative hydrogen storage system developed by this project, fuel cell electric vehicles can advance national health and welfare through reduction of emissions, and promotion of energy independence both on the ground and in the air. This project will develop a new class of liquid hydrogen storage tanks for electric UAVs that will increase the reliability and performance of surveillance platforms in the armed forces, reducing risk to American service personnel while they secure the defense of our nation. The same electric platforms will promote the national welfare by enabling the inspection of key energy and transportation infrastructure and serving as intelligence and communications platforms for first responders during natural disasters. In addition, the key technology developed in this project will expand the utility of additive manufacturing by demonstrating the capabilities and performance of engineered plastics in cryogenic (< -238°F) environments. Such cryogenic rated 3D printed polymer parts have wide ranging impacts, including cost reduction, across cryogenic dependent technology areas from medical devices and spacecraft to drug and food processing.

    Additively manufactured polymers have never been used in cryogenic applications until now. The correct selection of polymer blend, testing and selection of a lightweight impermeable membrane, and thermal characterization of novel insulation materials are critical to project success.  Since most cryogenic research, such as -423°F permeation of hydrogen through polymers, has not been studied since the 1960s, extensive cryogenic engineering and testing experience is required to apply modern materials and manufacturing methods to the project. The objectives of this project will fill knowledge gaps by testing metallized polymer films for hydrogen permeability, as well as manufacturing methods to cost effectively apply it to insulation panels or tank walls. While prior research has identified a polymer blend that is robust to cryogenic thermal cycling, the possibility of microcracking has not yet been thoroughly addressed and will be evaluated in this project. Novel insulation materials never before used in commercial cryogenic applications will be thermally characterized and integrated into the prototype tank. This project will conclude by completing a liquid hydrogen fuel fill and measuring the mass boil-off rate to test computational fluid dynamic modeled performance.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is that it will enable the automated harvesting of fragile produce such as strawberries to help offset a shrinking workforce and increased labor costs. The world population is expected to grow from 7.3 billion to 11.2 billion by 2100, this population growth and a rising middle class will place more demand on the agricultural industry. Presently, the agricultural industry relies solely on manual labor to harvest its fragile produce. There is no mechanized option that can reliably and cost effectively harvest these crops. Consequently, the industry is struggling to harvest its crop, maintain quality and control its costs. High quality and lower costs can only be maintained if robotic harvesters are utilized that can pick fragile produce without damage. One of the key elements on the automated harvester is a gripper that can grab and pick the produce without damage. There is a market for a reliable and low cost robotic gripper that can gently pick and handle strawberries and other fragile produce.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project involves the development of a robotic end effector that can be used to harvest and handle fragile produce. Advances in machine vision and robotics has made it possible to commercially harvest fragile produce such as strawberries, however, the key component that still needs to be developed is an end effector that can pick the fruit without damage and be reliable and cost effective. Design and development of this end effector will use a new and novel method for grabbing the strawberry with advances in design, materials and actuation. The proposed R&D plan will involve repeated testing of the interaction between the fruit and the end effector. Analytical studies using a series of thin film load sensors mounted on the end effector will provide real time load profiles that can be used to optimize the design and performance of the end effector. Shelf life testing of the fruit will be used to assess the success of the end effector in properly picking and handling the fruit without damage.

This will make building operations more sustainable and help improve the energy security of the U.S, create jobs, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, when commercially available, this new technology will bring all of the well-known benefits of enhanced natural lighting for occupants of millions of residential and commercial buildings across the U.S., such as connection to outdoors and improved comfort, productivity and well-being, thus benefiting many groups of consumers.

    The proposed project will demonstrate the feasibility of a novel, non-prismatic optical film material and its use for enhanced daylighting harvesting in buildings. This material employs thousands of microscopic reflective surfaces embedded into the bulk of the material and operates by capturing the incident sunlight and projecting it deep into the building interior. Commercial buildings alone consume about 20 percent of all energy used in the United States at an estimated cost of nearly $180 billion. Building interior lighting accounts for around 30% of that cost. By applying the daylight-harvesting optical material to windows of building facades, a significant fraction of that energy consumption can be offset using the natural light captured throughout the day. The project will provide the critical design, testing, and experimental validation needed to transition the technology into the commercial sector. The primary objective of the project is to develop the core light-redirecting material and associated micro-optical fabrication technology that can be subsequently scaled for low-cost mass production. A second objective is to develop, test and demonstrate a prototype daylight-harvesting window film product based on this material.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to revolutionize the healthcare industry by developing computing solutions for precision medicine.  Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) now produces a large amount of genome data at an affordable cost. Analyzing large volumes of genome data from diverse populations will lead to a better understanding of the causes of various diseases ranging from cancer to rare genetic disorders, and develop better cures. By sequencing a patient's genome, it is possible to more specifically determine his/her condition and devise an individualized treatment plan. And, if every newborn's genome was sequenced, it would allow for proactive identification of disease risks, and early intervention. Understanding viruses and bacteria will help us gain a better understanding of infectious diseases, and thereby enable us to develop better immunization and disease control methods. In addition to health-care, genomics also may help engineer better food crops and attain food security.  This project will develop novel computing hardware solutions that are customized for genomics sequencing software. These computing solutions can help realize an exponential growth in the digital genomics market and bring affordable personalized medicine to all.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to accelerate Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) by building a customized processor for genomics automata.  Over the last decade, the production cost of sequencing has plummeted from ten million dollars to a thousand dollars, and is soon expected to go below a hundred dollars per genome. Advancements in processor performance, however, have not kept pace. It can take several days on a computing cluster to sequence a genome. For genome sequencing to become as affordable as a routine medical test, computing solutions are required that can sequence a genome in minutes, and cost only a few dollars per genome. This project is developing a novel ASIC hardware accelerator for computing finite state automata, which supports approximate string matching, a computational kernel widely used in genomics applications such as sequencing. The design is based on a novel in-memory hardware technology for efficiently implementing state transitions. The goal is the improve efficiency of genomics automata by two orders of magnitude compared to modern processors.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be to help control nutrient contaminants in soil and water for the benefit of the world?s population, by providing sustainable access to safe drinking water. The estimated national economic cost of nitrogen pollution in drinking water is $19 billion annually, while the cost to freshwater ecosystems is $78 billion per year. Traditional water-quality monitoring practices are based on "grab-samples" that are sent for laboratory analyses that may take days to weeks to be completed.  Similar traditional approaches are found in agriculture where excessive application of nitrate-based fertilizers may result in agricultural runoff that carries pollution to ground and surface water sources. The proposed high-performance, low-cost optical sensor technology will enable deployment of a dense real-time monitoring network in freshwater sources, water treatment facilities, and farms, and will gain a significant foothold in the $6.8B global water quality monitoring equipment market. In the event of natural disasters, integration of the proposed nitrate sensor will be useful in assessment of water quality in local water resources, providing communities with real-time information on water safety.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project focuses on the development of a non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) detector for real-time monitoring of nitrate concentration in water. This effort will combine nitrate-selective ion-exchange membrane technology with today's low-cost infrared (IR) components for the design of a new type of sensor targeting applications in aqueous environment. The proposed technology relies on infrared optical fibers for signal transmission. Currently, the use of commercial real-time optical nitrate sensors, based on ultra-violet (UV) absorption, is limited due to the optical interferences in the UV spectra related to the inorganic and organic substances, and reduced UV transmission caused by turbidity. The proposed proprietary IR technology is designed to overcome these shortcomings through implementation of smart membrane filtering. The instrument will provide high frequency data collection in dynamic aqueous environments with a wide sensitivity range (1 to 100 ppm). This technology can be further expanded for measurement of additional nutrients and contaminants, making it a robust tool for water quality assessment.

    This SBIR Phase I project will study the development of a digitally configurable shape around which a shoe can be created. The results of this project will enable the mass-customization of shoes so they can precisely fit the feet of the individuals who wear them. Properly fitting shoes are intended to improve the quality of life of customers through reduced pain and improved musculoskeletal health. This development in shoe-making technology is of broad interest to the population of the United States, but particularly important to women, who often suffer from physical deformities and injuries caused by ill-fitting shoes. The proposed innovation relies on mass-customization methods and flexible robotics technology. Its anticipated success will provide additional jobs in the shoe industry and related fields, and improve productivity nationwide through reduced healthcare costs.


    The strong technical innovation in this project will be the adaptation of granular jamming technology for use in programmable shape technology. The driving goal of the proposed project is to develop a last for use in the mass-customization of shoes that is capable of changing shape in response to a digital representation of the customer's foot shape. After changing shape, it will lock into a rigid but smooth form appropriate for use in traditional shoe manufacturing methods. The scope of the research will cover the development of the last in a manner appropriate for use in manufacturing conditions (in terms of both physical and temperature durability) and the creation and implementation of algorithms for transforming foot shape data into an appropriately fitting shoe shape and for transforming a standard shoe pattern onto an arbitrary foot shape. Iterative design practices and just-in-time manufacturing techniques will facilitate the development of this new technology and manufacturing methodology.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project objective is to overcome weaknesses of current composite materials due to delamination and develop composites with more than 100% improvement in interlaminar toughness. The project aims to accelerate the innovation of epoxy/resin nanoadditives for composite materials in order to solve this problem. Composites are expected to be the fastest growing application segment in the global epoxy resin market, with an estimated compounded annual growth rate of ~6% and an expected market value of $14.5 billion by 2024. The key drivers in the market are the end-use industries which include aerospace, automotive, transportation, and coatings. There is a critical need to make these materials safer and more reliable by increasing their low velocity impact resistance, and to increase the adhesion between laminar layers. The product could have an obtainable market volume of $36 million in the US alone by 2021.

    The intellectual merit of this project is in the development of new hybrid nanofillers based on Graphene Oxide (GO) and Polyhedral Oligomeric Silsesquioxane (POSS). These nanofillers can be added to epoxy/vinyl ester/polyester matrices through a "Master Batch" process to enhance the interlaminar fracture toughness of commercial composites. This increase in fracture toughness can be more than 100% at extremely low addition levels (~0.2% by weight of the composite) without any changes in current manufacturing processes. Nanofillers such as carbon nanotubes and nanoclays are difficult to add to composite matrices because of their tendency to agglomerate and result in poor dispersion, apart from major changes in current manufacturing practices. Preliminary experiments have demonstrated that it is possible to develop these hybrid nanofillers based on GO and POSS that can be added to composite matrices with excellent dispersion in composite industry standard solvents. The challenges of dispersion are overcome through hybridization and Master Batching. Characterization of the cured Master Batches as well as measurement of physical properties of sample composites will be carried out to optimize the nanofiller content and the processing parameters.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is a healthier honeybee population to increase food security. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization, annual production must increase by 60% from 2007 to produce enough food for an estimated 9.1 billion people by 2050, which will be impossible without honeybee pollination (Food and Agriculture Organization, 2012). Honeybee populations have declined precipitously for the past 60 years?a total loss of 3 million hives (National Agricultural Statistics Service, 2007). Annual hive losses cost the U.S. economy $2 billion (National Agricultural Statistics Service, 2016; The White House, 2014). This project aims to enhance scientific understanding of the problem by finding practical solutions to hive loss for beekeepers, advancing IoT applications in beekeeping, and automating data analysis for beekeepers. Researchers and experts suspect the declines are due to multiple factors, but research is limited by a lack of technology tracking the hives on a large scale. Researchers' inability to perform analysis on a large, diverse dataset has obstructed their ability to draw conclusions on causes of hive loss and drive innovation on traditional beekeeping methods. 

    This proposed project will advance Internet of Things applications in beekeeping by automating data analysis for beekeepers through algorithm building. Several studies built models to describe actions inside the hive. However, these are built on limited data or are theoretical. Henry et al., 2016 mentioned the need for predictive algorithms to be expanded to larger data sets to reduce hive loss. Data driven beekeeping is in its infancy as an industry, but based on the success in the AgTech space, data monitoring will be a necessary step in solving colony health problems. The project will take a database of over 4,000 hives to improve research models for practical monitoring. This database will be paired with sensor and monitoring data from project hives. Through the project hives the company will confirm the sensor quality for commercialization. The company will create a baseline model of a healthy hive to detect anomalies. These anomalies will be worked into a predictive model to detect problems related to pests and diseases in the hive. The company will look for broad detection of a threatened hive, then drill down into specific problems (like Varroa mites). These finds will be included in monitoring products offered to beekeepers.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes a new, low-cost approach to 3D millimeter wave image sensors enabling non-destructive evaluation in construction, as well as other fields such as robotics, security, and quality control. Millimeter wave imaging uses human-safe, radio frequency signals to make high resolution images of objects that cannot be seen with conventional optical sensors. Because of their long wavelength, millimeter waves pass through many materials that are opaque to visible light, including common construction materials such as drywall, brick, tile, cement, and wood. For example, in the construction market, dramatic cost savings and faster, safer, and more accurate construction work could be achieved using millimeter wave imaging for structural evaluation as well as observing hidden utilities such as wiring and plumbing that should be avoided while drilling, and detecting hazards such as water leaks behind wall surfaces. This project will also provide entrepreneurial opportunity to a new generation of scholars/innovators as the technology matures toward commercial practice.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to advance the state of the art in millimeter wave imaging and enable low-cost, standalone 3D millimeter wave imagers. Prior work in a laboratory environment has demonstrated the promise of millimeter wave imaging for applications such as structural analysis in construction, however commercialization requires an image sensor that is fast, portable, low power, and low cost. This project will enable low cost hardware/software platforms for millimeter wave imaging using commercial chipsets with novel general purpose graphics processing unit (GPGPU)-accelerated image reconstruction algorithms.

    This SBIR Phase I project develops chemical tools and platforms to produce valuable chemical building blocks that can be used to produce synthetically challenging compounds on large scales. These compounds belong to the class of polypropionates which is known for its diverse and powerful biological activities across multiple indications within the pharmaceutical, agrochemical, and veterinary industries. The high impact of the polypropionate class is hampered by the inefficiencies of current chemical processes to fully tackle their complex structures. Importantly, the lack of scalability adds another severe complication to the development process. To fully unlock the potential of this class, improved chemistries with greater efficiencies are required to successfully identify high impact candidates for further development. Moreover, the new tools are excellent substrates for polyketide?{enhanced drug discovery. This project is a prelude to the development of a novel class of compounds against rare and unmet needs in cancer in collaboration with the NCI/NIH. Such cancers pose a huge burden on the healthcare system and the economy in general. Inspired by the NSF mission, this project describes an innovative chemical process that can deliver highly valuable compounds. Such an approach will enable accelerated discoveries across multiple medicinal and agrochemical needs.

    This project aims to provide all sixteen possible stereotetrad building blocks (in the form of chiral lactones) for construction of polypropionates on practical scales. Those chiral building blocks can serve as common precursors for synthesis of polypropionates, as tools for rational design and structure activity relationship (SAR) studies, or as entries for more diverse and complex library of analogs. The chemistry platform used to produce those building blocks is referred to as the Chiral Carbon Catalog (CCC). The CCC platform is a synthetic tool box that allows stereoselective large scale economic synthesis of various complex polypropionate building blocks from simple starting materials. The unified process has been carefully designed to employ highly diastereoselective substrate directed transformations while avoiding expensive and impractical chiral auxiliary overheads or expensive catalysts. The high efficiencies of transformations allow the elimination of tedious and expensive purifications such as column chromatography. The crystalline natures of key intermediates enable facile production on scale and allow the synthetic routes used by the platform to be easily adopted by the industry for large scale production. This ensures adequate supply of those building blocks for development of complex chiral products within several industries (e.g. pharmaceutical and agrochemical fields).

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to reduce the power consumption of display and lighting products by 90%. It will do so by enabling the pervasive use of light emitting diodes (LEDs) in such products. LEDs consume substantially less power than other display/lighting technologies and also offer benefits such as superior picture or lighting quality and longer lifespan. The foremost barrier to the emergence of such products is the difficulty of economically placing large quantities of LEDs onto a product grid. For example, if current-day methods are used to create a full high definition display, its assembly would take about a month and drive its cost far beyond what the market could accept. This project's innovation addresses this problem with a laser-based, ultra-high speed LED placement solution. Beyond this immediate application, it will further the industry's technical capabilities relative to electronics component assembly in general. The commercial potential for chip-based LED display and lighting products is expected to reach about $10 billion within five years. The market for LED placement solutions in support of these products will be about $1 billion in this same time frame.

    The proposed project addresses the above problem by demonstrating an ultra-high speed LED placement method that can reduce the one month assembly time in the example above to just one minute. This solution, unlike others in development, increases the placement rate of LEDs by a factor of 10,000 and includes the ability to pre-screen and replace non-functional LEDs. This project will demonstrate the core aspect of this solution involving the placement of multiple, very small LEDs ("microLEDs") using a single laser pulse diffracted into multiple scanned beams. It will use this solution to demonstrate the extremely fast assembly of a quantum dot-based microLED display. The project will build upon a related, previously demonstrated capability applied to larger, silicon dies. Each aspect of the technology (wafer preparation, single laser beam placement, multi-beam placement) will be individually optimized for the new conditions imposed by the smaller sized, sapphire-based microLEDs. This new, LED-tailored capability will then be used to demonstrate the assembly of a four thousand pixel microLED display in under one second thereby achieving the project's goal of demonstrating a >50M units/hour LED placement rate.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve health and save lives while addressing a market opportunity of over a billion dollars per year. Worldwide particulate matter air pollution is responsible for nearly as many deaths as cancer, and more than malaria and AIDS combined. The goal of the project is an inexpensive, consumer market air pollution sensor that offers performance comparable to laboratory instruments that cost hundreds to thousands of dollars. The proposed technology has important societal benefit as it will help mitigate the negative health effects of air pollution in the environment, home, and workplace. The proposed project contributes to scientific knowledge and understanding by investigating novel particulate matter analysis techniques and enabling a highly-sensitive, portable, and low-cost monitor for studies of air pollution. With the form-factor of a AA-battery, it is the only particulate matter air pollution sensor that can fit in devices like the Amazon Echo or Google Nest. Markets for the sensor include smart homes, smart cities, green buildings, automobile cabin monitoring, air purifiers, industrial hygiene, and others. 

    The proposed project will investigate a novel sensor for monitoring particulate matter air pollution. Existing air pollution monitors are expensive, large, and power hungry. The monitors on the consumer market use optical techniques that provide only a proxy estimate of pollution levels and are unable to detect ultrafine particulates which have diameters smaller than 100 nanometers. These ultrafine particulates pose serious health risks. The sensor of this work employs thermophoretic deposition of airborne particulates from a sample stream onto an acoustic wave resonator, and determines the mass deposited by measuring the frequency shift of a sustaining electronic oscillator circuit. The monitor of this work detects particulates from a few microns in diameter to ultrafine, and provides a true mass concentration measurement of the pollution, which is acknowledged as the industry gold-standard. Key activities of the proposal include the development of innovative techniques to collect and analyze particulates and to improve the sensor stability and lifetime. Anticipated technical results include enhanced monitor longevity, improved level of detection, improved manufacturability, and a significant reduction in power consumption. Coupling the sensor to a cell-phone or other wireless device would enable dense temporal and spatial wireless air quality measurements.

- abstractText: "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is aimed
    at developing a nondestructive testing device based on Magnetic Pressure Sensor
    Technology. The innovation can detect steel mass and corrosion in bridges, tendons,
    infrastructures, and pipes. The technical level of this innovation is ?early stage?,
    where the scientific principles have been identified and feasibility will be established
    in this effort. Safety is an increasing concern for the nation?s bridges. According
    to a bridge report published by the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE),
    over two hundred million trips are taken daily across deficient bridges in the
    United States? largest metropolitan regions. The innovation possesses favorable
    features that make it suitable for different non-destructive testing (NDT) applications.
    Those features include it being safe to operate, having real-time fast imaging
    speed, light-weight, battery operated, scalable to different sizes, flexible to
    address different shapes, and affordable to multiple field deployments.  The overall
    market for non-destructive testing and inspection was valued at $6.46B in 2015
    and is expected to increase to $11.39B by 2022 at a CAGR of 8.3% between 2016
    and 2022. \n \n\nThe intellectual merit of this project is the development of
    a Magnetic-Pressure-Sensors (MaPS) device, which already demonstrated significant
    promise for use in generating volumetric images of steel mass loss in exposed
    post-tension reinforcement tendons in bridges. Rotating the MaPS device around
    the circumference of the tendon or placing multiple devices around the circumference;
    can provide a 2D cross-section map of the total internal steel mass distribution.
    The device has also been tested on corroded steel rods and it was able to react
    only to the total steel mass as rust (mainly Fe2O3) loses the magnetic property
    of iron.  The innovation here is the combination of a magnet, a pressure sensor
    between the magnet and the surface of the structure, and a communication device
    to report the force detected by the pressure sensor. This combination provides
    a force signal directly correlated to the mass and location of steel inside the
    inspected structure.  The objective of this proposal is to develop a MaPS sensor
    technology to measure and image steel mass loss in bridge tendons and pipelines.
    This will be achieved by developing a magnet arrangement for better penetration
    depth, an activation pattern of distributed magnets, image reconstruction, and
    mechanical enclosure."

    This SBIR Phase I project aims to prove the technical feasibility and the economic viability of natural fiber welded and dyed yarns and fabrics. Natural fiber welding is process that swells and mobilizes polymers within natural fibers to create higher performance yarns and fabrics. At sufficiently fast rates, individual fibers are fused and bonded together without glues or resins while retaining a majority of the natural structure and order of natural polymers. This leads to improved mechanical properties while maintaining the benefits of a natural product. Moreover, during the welding process, functional materials and chemistries including dyes, antimicrobials, and flame retardants can be simultaneously locked within yarns and fabrics in new eco-friendly ways. This new ability has potential to displace, for example, present day resource intensive processes such as indigo dyeing for denim which is a water and chemical intensive process that requires significant equipment investment. Inclusion of indigo dye via natural fiber welding processes has tremendous potential to reduce the environmental impact of denim manufacture while saving costs and simultaneously improving the performance of resultant fabrics and with innovative new design effects. This type of disruptive innovation would bring in sustainable US-based manufacturing throughout the value chain of the massive multitrillion dollar per year textile industry.


    An extremely promising and tunable class of solvents for natural fiber welding processes are called ionic liquids. This project explores several new types of ionic liquid-based solvent systems co-optimized with new automated hardware designs to cost effectively enact natural fiber welding processes with cotton and other natural fiber-containing yarn substrates. In so doing, ionic liquid-based process solvents are recovered in a closed-loop recycling process thereby enabling economic viability as well as creating an eco-friendly manufacturing platform. This project will focus on proving proof of concept with new combinations of ionic liquid(s) and co-solvent(s) to enable concurrent welding with indigo dyeing while developing high efficiency recycling methodologies. There are known methodologies to separate ionic liquids in dilute aqueous solutions but these have not yet been developed for situations where additional miscible co-solvents are present. The objective of this project is to demonstrate natural fiber welding processes that deliver indigo dye into cotton-based yarn substrates while achieving high rates of recycling with process solvents that contain co-solvent(s) and to enable scalable processes for potentially billions of pounds of denim products produced annually.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project will be a cost-effective, commercially viable, alternative process for on-site treatment of food waste and energy recovery.  In the U.S., nearly 40% of food is wasted with $165 billion equivalent loss of food plus associated water, energy, chemicals, and labor used in food production.  Disposal of the food waste involves additional costs and causes environmental pollution, e.g. rotting food waste in landfills accounts for a large portion of U.S. methane emissions, a powerful greenhouse gas.  Moreover, food waste streams contain a substantial amount of chemical energy that also is lost by its disposal.  Recovering energy in food waste in the form of biofuel and chemicals, as proposed in this project, will provide efficient management of food waste problem reducing food waste disposal costs while producing useful products.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to develop and demonstrate the performance of a novel, immobilized clostridia cell membrane bioreactor-based continuous process to convert food waste to butanol.  The conventional stirred-tank fermentation reactor-based food waste conversion process exhibits low butanol concentration as well as productivity.  The proposed process will address the technical barriers of the conventional process by immobilizing the clostridia cells on porous media to dramatically increase cell culture density, and, consequently, butanol productivity and conversion efficiency.  In addition, by separating butanol from the reaction media, recycled butanol concentration is minimized in the reactor, which alleviates butanol toxicity.  The membrane fouling issues in biomass separation will be addressed by an "open channel" membrane module design to separate and recycle biomass to the bioreactor.  The energy requirement for recovery of butanol from dilute reactor effluent will be reduced by an order of magnitude over the conventional distillation by using a pervaporation membrane.  The objective of the proposed effort is to demonstrate a steady state continuous integrated process for converting food waste to butanol after optimizing individual components.

    a great demand for in-situ chemical sensor technology with ability to (1) Measure
    with high resolution the environmental footprint of agricultural and urban development,
    and (2) Identify potential safety issues related to drinking water quality. High
    concentrations of nutrients (e.g. nitrate, nitrite, orthophosphate) in surface
    waters are the source of environmental, public health, and economic issues. Active
    monitoring of nutrient concentrations in surface waters such as estuaries, lakes
    and rivers is critical in assessing their health and implementing timely action
    to minimize ecosystem degradation. This SBIR project aims at developing a disruptive
    new type of highly miniaturized autonomous water quality chemical sensor, that
    can be operated remotely and autonomously, has minimal installation and maintenance
    requirements, is capable of performing thousands of measurements directly in-situ,
    in both reagent-based and reagent-less configuration, on a single battery charge.
    Applications that will greatly benefit from such sensors range from scientific
    research, to estimating nutrient loads, establishing discharge limits, predicting
    eutrophication conditions and demonstrating compliance with regulatory reporting
    requirements. Independently, the drinking water industry has its own requirements
    for autonomous chemical sensors for monitoring reservoirs and distribution networks,
    optimizing treatment processes and identifying tank nitrification issues early-on.
    \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to achieve
    the highest level of miniaturization and functionality attempted in a commercial
    water quality sensor. The core innovation of this proposed e-CHEM system is in
    the microfluidic chemical analysis module, combining a novel highly-efficient
    mixing mechanism to homogenize minute volumes of reagent with the fluid sample
    with a microfluidic implementation of dual reagent-based and reagent-less chemical
    measurement capability, the possibility of controlling relevant chemical reactions
    in-situ via precise on-chip temperature management, and finally the potential
    of overcoming the important hurdle of bio-fouling via novel surface nano-engineering.
    The parameters measured will include a selection from: ortho-phosphates, nitrites,
    nitrates, dissolved organic carbon, total and/or free chlorine, free ammonia,
    and pH. The system will include bidirectional wireless telemetry to enable automatic
    alert generation and data transmission to remote servers for visualization, analysis
    and interpretation. Target accuracy and response times are superior to traditional
    measurement techniques due to full process automation, elimination of sample degradation
    and transit times, reduction of human error, and automatic data centralization."

    Research (SBIR) project is to develop specialized cell culture plates that can
    provide dynamic optical stimulation of cells during kinetic ion channel drug screening
    assays.  The proposed cell stimulation technology is expected to improve the efficiency
    of drug discovery, and lead to more promising drug candidates with a wide range
    of mechanisms of actions.  Since effects of drugs often depend on functional states
    of drug targets, in vitro high-throughput assays must be able to re-create different
    functional states during drug screening. Currently, screening assays acquire the
    data either from one functional state or an ensemble average of heterogeneous
    states, which is not representative of in vivo settings.  The proposed microplate-based
    cell stimulation technology will help drug discovery companies to introduce more
    efficient drugs faster while reducing the development costs, because the proposed
    technology can dynamically \"cycle\" ion channel drug targets through different
    functional states while evaluating drug effects in kinetic assays. These minimally-invasive
    all-optical assays will have increased information content and enhanced predictive
    values. \n\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop nanotechnology-based
    optoelectronic microplates that can serve as a light-controlled actuator enabling
    dynamic optical stimulation of cells for all-optical drug screening assays.  Current
    cell stimulation technologies require either genetic modifications of cells (which
    can affect the drug screening results) or electric-field stimulation (which requires
    specialized instrumentation and can damage cells). The proposed technology is
    a non-invasive optical stimulation plate-based platform that can work on genetically
    and structurally intact cells, and will be compatible with existing screening
    instruments. The research plan in the material science area covers the development
    of protocols for deposition of graphene materials and comprehensive characterization
    of graphene-coated microplates in cell-free and cell-based modes. The biological
    research plan includes the development of all-optical screening assays that incorporate
    graphene-coated microplates for enabling optical stimulation.  Specifically, the
    goal is to focus on calcium imaging assays for L-type voltage-gated calcium ion
    channels that will be \"cycled\" through different functional states by light
    illumination using optoelectronic plates. The validation process will include
    the evaluation of pharmacological effects of known state-dependent calcium channel
    blockers. It is anticipated that optoelectronic microplates will be compatible
    with existing cell culture protocols and imaging instrumentation."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is the development of potentially the first FDA-approved phage therapeutic, non-antibiotic remedy specifically designed for honeybees. This treatment has the potential to become the global gold standard for treating American Foulbrood, a devastating honey bee disease caused by the bacteria Paenibacillus larvae, which threatens 2.7 million beehives in the United States and 92.5 million beehives worldwide. The American foulbrood treatment market opportunity is $500 M, and this technology promises a significant reduction of current unprecedented mortality rates of honeybees, curtailment of antibiotics being used in beehives, which perpetuates antibiotic resistance in the environment, and support for organic agricultural production.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to expand the collection of Paenibacillus larvae bacterial strains for novel phage therapy development, enlarge the library of P. larvae bacteriophages from which an optimized treatment can be created, and test against each other to determine the optimal therapeutic phage combination. The expansion of the P. larvae strain and phages collection is critical because of the high specificity phages have for their hosts. Samples of P. larvae and phage will be collected from the entire United States. These greatly expanded phage and bacteria collections will help to ensure that treatments will be developed to effectively treat any American foulbrood infection.

    This SBIR Phase I project creates an online integrated training program that combines problem solving and app development. Trainees will be able to create mobile apps to address challenges facing their own communities. Mobile apps have become key to addressing many pain points. Currently, skilled developers work with customers to understand problems and create applications to solve problems. Unfortunately, this restricts app creation to those that have access to development resources and understand problem solving techniques. The platform created in this project will democratize access to app development by giving problem solving and app development skills to high school students. Thus, it presents an opportunity to every citizen to create apps that can address their own or their community's challenges. This opportunity can have a transformational impact particularly on underprivileged communities where people have very little access to resources. Mobile app development is also a skill that has the potential for significant income generation opportunity. At the end of the training, students will be certified for their problem solving and app generation skill ability. High school students who have certification to prove their problem solving and App Development skills become highly valued employees in the work force of the future.

    This project creates a drag-and-drop tool that allows anyone to be able to create smartphone applications, as well as an online portal that explains how to use the platform. The app creation tool will allow users to (1) develop a smartphone app for multiple operating systems; (2) live test their apps on their mobile devices; (3) download their completed apps onto their personal devices; and (4) publish their apps to the app store of their choosing. The online learning platform will deliver multimedia content to teach and enable users across the country to be able to build mobile applications on this platform. The world's mobile population is expected to reach 5.7 billion people by 2020, yet only a very small number of these users are expected to be able program these devices. Thus, this project looks to build a tool that lowers the barrier to building mobile smartphone apps via a drag-and-drop interface, as well as educate users on how to use this tool.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to develop a new class of cancer therapeutics that involves the re-directing of the body's pre-existing immune response obtained through previous childhood vaccination to target tumor cells for cancer eradication. Globally, cancer continues to be a top 5 leading cause of death resulting in a high unmet need for novel therapies and treatments. Immune checkpoint inhibitor drugs have emerged as a potent solution with demonstrated clinical benefits. However, such treatments are expensive and toxic, and up to 70% of cancer patients do not respond to such drugs due to the absence of an anti-tumor response. In contrast, the proposed strategy tailors the patient's tumor to become susceptible towards their own pre-existing childhood vaccine immunity. This approach will change treatment outcomes for many cancer patients previously un-targetable by current immuno-therapeutic drugs. This also circumvents the risky and costly R&D challenges in identifying and/or producing potent immune responses against cancer.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a platform technology to mobilize immunity generated from childhood vaccines and re-direct this activity towards tumors to eradicate cancer. This will be done via two development aims.  The first aim will demonstrate the ability of the proposed technology to mobilize existing childhood vaccine responses from mice (with relevant human genetics) vaccinated with childhood vaccines (MMR, HepB, Chickpox vaccines). The second aim will be to test whether cancers with known metastasis challenges, such as ovarian and breast cancer, may be eradicated. Specifically, mice will be vaccinated with an appropriate childhood vaccine, then injected with relevant syngeneic tumors. Once the tumor is established, the proposed therapeutic will be injected to see if it can induce pre-existing immunity developed from the childhood vaccine and redirected towards the tumor. Therapeutic effect will be assessed based on the number of metastases and tumor weight/volume. If successful, this platform will provide both tumor specificity and broad applicability to a wide variety of cancers.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve the care of men with suspected prostate cancer, by providing the benefits of tumor localization within the prostate by state of the art endorectal multiparametric MRI combined with the benefits of precision biopsy using MRI-targeted needle sampling as a single patient-convenient procedure. The current standard approach to prostate cancer, transrectal ultrasound guided systematic biopsy, requires 12 needle samples from standard locations in the prostate with the hope of hitting any cancer that might be present. This option is essentially playing a game of battleships with the prostate, and is, unsurprisingly, inaccurate with high rates of underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis. Many patients require repeated biopsy because of these inaccuracies. By way of contrast, it is inconceivable that breast cancer would be diagnosed by placing twelve needles at standard locations in the breast, yet this has been the longstanding 'state-of-the-art' for prostate cancer. With approximately one million prostate biopsies are performed annually in the U.S., the market and clinical need is large and of major socioeconomic importance.

    The proposed project will preliminarily determine the technical and commercial feasibility of combining an endorectal MRI coil with a transrectal multichannel array of biopsy needle guides into a single device that would provide the ability to perform MRI for diagnosis and targeted needle placement as a single integrated procedure. Such a device could transform the current paradigm for prostate cancer diagnosis, providing greater precision, personalization, and patient convenience. To determine technical feasibility, the project plan is to fabricate and 3D print a proof-of-concept device for initial simulation experiments and selection of the final coil configuration, evaluate imaging performance of the device coil by measuring signal to noise ratio on standard MR images in a human male pelvic phantom and evaluate the fidelity of needle deployment by measurement of linear deviation between actual and intended needle positioning in a phantom in transverse and longitudinal directions. At all stages, continuous design and engineering modifications will be made to ensure satisfactory technical performance.

    and Biopsy Device to Enable Single Combined Procedures'
- abstractText: "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop
    an optical delivery system compatible with a transmission electron microscope
    (TEM) that will facilitate atomic-scale imaging and characterization at high-temperatures
    and excited states. The most critical and far-reaching broader impact of the proposed
    system is the new science/discovery that it will enable. Imaging and characterization
    at the nano- and atomic-scale are critical to advancing new materials and technologies,
    which are in turn critical to research and industry laboratories. The instrumentation
    will enable researchers to uncover high-temperature and excited-state materials
    phenomena in unique temperature and temporal regimes previously inaccessible.
    The successful development of the proposed instrumentation will generate revenue
    and incubate several follow-on products, which in turn will create jobs. Year
    5 will focus on both industry and research laboratories and market targets for
    both existing and new TEM sales. Conveniently, the system can be adapted for other
    materials characterization techniques to broaden the impact of the innovation.
    \ \n\nThe intellectual merit of this project is the design, assembly, and testing
    of an optical delivery system specifically suitable for nano-and atomic-scale
    characterization in the TEM.  The innovation delivers a system with unprecedented
    ability to manipulate materials in the TEM via the localized photothermal and
    photoexcited modalities. The photothermal modality will enable agile, non-invasive,
    and ubiquitous access to TEM specimens and enable unique temperature and temporal
    regimes not accessible with standard resistive heating systems. The excitation
    modality will enable researchers to image and characterize optical-excited states
    of materials at the nanoscale. The proposed instrumentation consists of dual fiber-coupled
    optical heating and excitation channels housed on a specially designed nanomanipulator
    for accurate x-y-z positioning. In addition to the hardware development, appropriate
    software controls will be developed for the optical sources and the nanomanipulator
    system. Finally, in-microscope testing of the in situ heating and excitation will
    be performed at the University of Tennessee. Specifically, three tasks are proposed
    for the in-microscope testing/validation: (1) in situ high-temperature imaging,
    (2) photothermal adventitious carbon decontamination from graphene, and (3) in
    situ optical excitation of plasmonic nanoparticles during electron energy loss/gain
    spectroscopy."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the enabling the expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) through new functions and applications requiring greater wires-free power than available by battery. IoT is an ever-widening array of everyday objects interconnected via the Internet and transforming the way we live and work. "Smart devices" inter-networking in homes, businesses, vehicles, public spaces and elsewhere are an essential driver of the big data revolution, enabling innumerable societal benefits such as improved efficiencies, assure safety, and increase productivity. The growth of IoT devices has been enabled by the miniaturization, modularization, and cost reduction of common chipsets as well as increased intelligence in low-power consumption. IoT products that utilize existing wired power - e.g. smart lights, TVs, speakers, thermostats, security cameras, personal digital assistants, etc. - have dominated the market. Increasingly, however, stand-alone battery-powered IoT devices are gaining traction; but while battery technology is improving, the cost, complexity and downtime of battery replacement and/or recharging are major constraints. This project aims to develop a new type of indoor light harvesting technology capable of efficiently converting ambient indoor light into the electrical energy needed to power wire-free IoT products. 

    The proposed project aims to demonstrate and develop perovskite PV technology with the efficiency, uniformity, and durability needed for high-impact indoor IoT applications. Visible light is the most ubiquitous ambient power source available in places where humans live, work and gather, but existing light harvesting methods - e.g. crystalline and amorphous silicon PV cells - do not efficiently convert typical indoor light to electricity. For example, state-of-the-art amorphous silicon cells give only 3.6-7% efficiency under typical indoor lighting conditions. In order to enable new IoT products, a photovoltaic material that operates above 30% efficiency under a range of indoor lighting conditions is needed to unlock new levels of power available for sensors and communications that batteries may not easily supply. This project will demonstrate cell designs, film deposition and processing techniques needed to fabricate high-efficiency perovskite PV and to scale perovskite PV from university laboratory sizes to commercial IoT product sizes.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to improve the way educators and therapists teach social skills to children who are on the autism spectrum (as well as those affected by other social skills disorders) and deliver cost efficiencies that could expand access to such support across diverse socioeconomic classes and geographical regions. These advances have potential to produce meaningful quality-of-life improvements for these children in areas such as employability, educational attainment, and personal relationships. Given that there are ~900K children on the spectrum in the US alone, and that the rate of diagnosis has been rising in recent years, the technology has significant potential for impact. It also has significant commercial potential: the US special education and therapy market is estimated at over 8 billion dollars, and feedback from therapists and educators has indicated significant commercial demand for a product like this. In addition, by pushing the frontiers of video game-based training by incorporating real-time eye tracking data, the proposed project will expand scientific and technological understanding of how video games can be used to shape human behavior.


    The proposed project involves furthering the development and evaluation of a video game designed to help children on the autism spectrum improve their social skills?a significant and growing need. Key development activities include (1) adding multiple types of gaze-controlled social skill training exercises, namely those targeting emotion recognition and joint attention; (2) incorporating a low-cost, consumer-grade eye tracker; (3) building an automated feedback system to ensure proper player positioning relative to the eye tracker; and (4) refining adaptive algorithms to personalize game difficulty and maximize engagement. These features will be designed and implemented by a diverse team with expertise in video game development, autism research, and technology commercialization. Evaluation will consist of tracking performance against quantitatively measurable success metrics related to game playability and engagement via human subject research across 10 participants (50 gameplay sessions). The expected result is a video game that addresses multiple social skill deficits, engages the target demographic, and can be deployed by therapists, educators, and parents in a cost-effective manner.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to achieve non-contact continuous blood pressure monitoring and address a critical need for personalized medicine for hypertension. For the first time, hypertensive individuals will have access to a comfortable, non-contact, continuous blood pressure monitoring device that allows for seamless blood pressure measurement without disturbing the user in any way. With 1 out of every 3 adults in the United States living with hypertension, The proposed innovation will meet an important need to monitor blood pressure continuously and noninvasively, thereby providing new insight into how one's blood pressure responds to medication, exercise, diet, and their actions. Longer term, the data collected by the team will yield unprecedented insight into short and long-term blood pressure rhythms and has the potential to revolutionize personalized medicine for hypertension. This technology is expected to empower people with the feedback that they need to understand what works for them as an individual to maintain their health.


    The proposed project will lay the ground work for the development of a continuous-wear blood pressure monitoring device suitable for everyday use. Through an RF sensor that can detect arterial movement, the proposed technology can measure cardiovascular parameters for every heartbeat. To date, a prototype sensor has shown significant promise at providing accurate blood pressure measurements in a small sample. Beyond blood pressure information, the fundamental capability of the proposed technology is to measure arterial stiffness, a critical indicator of cardiovascular health. With the support of this NSF grant, the team is expected to develop its technology and ready it for commercialization. The goal for this project is to: (1) eliminate first-surface reflections and micro-motion artifacts related to RF sensing; (2) refine blood pressure algorithms and compare measurements against gold standard BP measurements in healthy, hypotensive, and hypertensive populations. The proposed technology could become an important scientific tool to aid the advancement of cardiovascular research, enabling researchers and clinicians alike to gain further understanding of cardiovascular-related health parameter.

- abstractText: "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is
    focused on developing a new probe technology for high magnetic field sensing and

    element that affords absolute measurements of strong fields with high-speed all-optical
    readout that is free of electromagnetic interference, directly addressing capability

    machines for early fault detection.  The technology also promises to expand capabilities
    of laboratory measurement instrumentation and contribute to experimental high
    magnetic field science requiring advanced instrumentation for measurement in the
    1 to 100 Tesla range. The extraordinary opportunities for scientific research
    and technological development represented by investment in high magnetic field

    physics principles that describe the spectroscopic response of atoms in strong
    magnetic fields, and quantum-optics phenomena that serve as a practical means
    to achieve all-optical readout of the atomic spectra, from which information on
    the magnetic field is obtained.  During this project, theoretical atomic spectra
    in strong magnetic fields will be developed, tested and refined.  A vapor-cell
    probe suitable for sensing strong magnetic fields will be designed, fabricated,
    and tested.  Laboratory experiments will be performed to measure the atomic response
    to magnetic fields in the range of 1 Tesla at ppm sensitivity levels.  The method
    will also be tested in time-varying and switching magnetic fields, on timescales
    of <100ms. Miniaturization of probes and read-out units will be initiated, leading
    towards robust and compact, practical sensing elements with higher operation speed
    and improved performance characteristics."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is that it will serve as a one-stop power conversion solution across the power conversion industries. The proposed Power Converter can convert power directly from AC-DC, DC-DC, DC-AC and AC-AC in a single stage without an interim AC or DC link. The said power converter can take fixed frequency, variable frequency or DC voltage as input and can deliver another fixed frequency, variable frequency or DC voltage at the output. The voltage can be stepped up or down and the power can flow back and forth in the said power converter. Having all the power conversion features in one hardware can serve almost all power conversion applications such as aircraft/spacecraft/ship, hybrid/electrical vehicle, renewable energy, automation industry and almost all other power conversion needs by a mere change of software. Such technology has a potential to become a mass-produced commodity and in effect the cost of the power converter can be dramatically reduced across all industries, Market research organization has estimated that by 2020, the power converter market will be valued at $65 billion. Therefore, the commercial impact of this one stop power converter solution will be significant.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will introduce a multifunctional power converter with single stage power conversion. By employing bi-directional 4-quadrant wide band gap switch, intelligent filters at input and output, advanced pulse width modulation and commutation scheme a more efficient, robust, smaller foot print, low-weight power converter will be realized which will convert power from input to output much faster with reduced loss and at the same time it will not need any bulky DC or AC link in between. By operating less number of semiconductor switches at a given time the loss and size of the power converter will be reduced. By having intelligent filter, high power quality at the input and output will be achieved. The multifunctional use of this power converter will cut down the number of on board power converters in aircraft/spacecraft/ship in a system level which will provide multi-fold benefit in terms of fuel economy. By having less loss, the power consumption will be reduced and by having smaller size and weight the payload will be less, which will improve the fuel economy. By reducing number of on board power converters the on-board weight will be reduced further. Therefore, overall fuel economy will be significantly improved.

    This STTR Phase I project will undertake the development of iron coordination complexes as alternatives for gadolinium contrast agents which are currently used in clinical MRI diagnostic exams.  New MRI contrast agents are needed to serve the segment of the population who cannot tolerate Gd(III) agents.  This includes patients with kidney disease and those who have frequent MRI scans and may accumulate Gd(III).  The proposed research involves the study of new trivalent iron coordination complexes based on those initially studied in the co-PI?s university laboratory. New iron complexes will be prepared and studied as contrast agents in live mice to improve characteristics of the agents such as clearance from the body.  Fundamental studies of the iron complexes will add to the body of knowledge on the paramagnetic properties of iron.
    For the most promising Fe(III) contrast agents, the synthetic procedures will be adapted for large scale preparation and purity determination.  Iron MRI contrast agents may also be beneficial to society by reducing gadolinium in water supply.  Furthermore, iron as an abundant element is less expensive and more readily available in the USA than is gadolinium. The commercialization of iron MRI contrast agents will create jobs in chemical manufacturing, sales, and in health-related occupations.

    The lead Fe(III) coordination complex on which this project is based produces longitudinal (T1) relaxivity of water protons that rival clinically used Gd(III) complexes at 4.7 Tesla, both under in vitro conditions and also in live mice. Importantly, these complexes contain macrocyclic ligands that stabilize iron in the trivalent state (negative redox potentials versus NHE) and do not produce reactive oxygen species even in the presence of ascorbate as a reductant and peroxide.  The importance of outersphere water and innersphere water interactions will be studied by varying the coordinating pendent groups on the macrocyclic ligand which is bound to Fe(III).   The ancillary group will be varied to increase binding to serum proteins and to modify the clearance route of the contrast agents either through kidneys or through hepatobiliary routes.  The complexes will be optimized for kinetic inertness towards release of iron under biologically relevant conditions.  Toxicity studies in cell culture will be carried out on each of the new complexes. This research will focus on both pilot scale preparation for the study of the Fe(III) complexes in vitro and also on larger scale preparations and HPLC analysis of the most promising new derivatives.  In vivo MRI scans in mice on a 4.7 T scanner will be used to track the distribution and clearance of the iron contrast agents as a function of time.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to drive the next generation of advanced computing power and performance, by manufacturing integrated circuits, the fundamental units of electronic systems, at length scales of 7 nm and smaller. Today?s central processing units (CPUs) each contain 7.2 Bn chips and over 1.2 sextillion chips are manufactured per year to meet computing demands. Next generation technology is expected to enable artificial intelligence and machine learning through both conventional computing and potentially neuromorphic paradigms, bringing to reality transformative applications such as self-driving cars and smart buildings. As Moore?s law continues to set the pace of technological advancement, chipmakers will deploy new EUV (Extreme Ultraviolet) lithography tools, using light of 13.5 nm to pattern integrated circuits or chip architecture into silicon wafers, for the next three generations of technology. Chipmakers strive to bring about the readiness of EUV technology in 2019. The global demand for next generation electronics is forever increasing as the population grows above 7 Bn. However, the global supply of electronics constantly faces challenges to reduce costs and deliver technology beyond Moore?s Law.

    The proposed project addresses the challenges related to high volume manufacturing at the 7 nm node for lithography tools and its components. For example, an EUV photomask, a high commodity component, patterns and replicates integrated circuit design into silicon wafers. Current EUV photomasks have a sub-optimal manufacturing yield of ~60% and suffer from defectivity which arises during fabrication of its architecture. During operational use the photomask sustains damage from the debris generated by the EUV plasma light source that implants in the mask and inevitably replicates in the wafer, destroying the integrated chip pattern. In high volume manufacturing, these issues manifest in the wafer yield, the reusability of a mask, and drive the need for high cost real-time inspection and metrology. A new EUV photomask which promises greater robustness to defects, a higher manufacturing yield, more reusability of masks in operations and a longer lifetime is presented. The goals of the project are to evaluate new integrated architecture for the EUV mask design, develop a higher yield fabrication process and characterize the EUV performance. More robust photomasks reduce the capital outlay required for in-situ metrology and inspection and ultimately bring down the cost of next generation electronics.

    This SBIR Phase I project seeks to transform treatment regimens for individuals suffering from malaria infections. Malaria, particularly caused by Plasmodium vivax (P. vivax) and Plasmodium ovale (P. ovale) remain a potential cause of morbidity and mortality amongst the 2.85 billion people living at risk of infection. The only drug currently available for treatment therapy for P. vivax and P. ovale is primaquine, which can cause life-threatening anemia in individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. Clinicians often do not prescribe primaquine due to the high prevalence (8%) of individuals who are born with G6PD deficiency. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Program for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH) are urgently searching for a reliable assay for the diagnosis of G6PD deficiency to effectively treat patients and aid in the eradication of P. vivax and P. ovale malaria. This novel assay proposed will quantify G6PD and hemoglobin (Hgb) concentration simultaneously from a finger stick sample. This system comprises a single test strip coupled with a reflectance-based meter and cell phone application with Blue Tooth connectivity to incorporate a patient?s I.D., test results, global tracking, and history of treatment. It is projected that this point-of-care assay will be used to screen >23 million people for G6PD within 5 years of launch and generate over $27.5 million in compounded revenue. In the long term, the novel assay will create a universal point-of-care platform that can be utilized for other diseases or conditions that affect patients in the Unites States for which point-of-care assays are not currently available.

    The proposed novel platform will quantify both Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) and hemoglobin (Hgb) concentrations simultaneously from a single finger stick sample using a point-of-care (POC) reflectance-based meter. There is currently no such device on the market, which is urgently needed to screen patients being treated for P. vivax and P. ovale malaria. A significant portion (8%) of the world population is G6PD deficient, which places these individuals at risk for life-threatening anemia after treatment with current therapeutics such as primaquine against malaria. The POC assay utilizes a novel lysis and reagent layer membrane platform to enable a reflectance-based meter to measure non-over lapping wavelengths to quantify G6PD and Hgb concentrations. In this proposal, a functional prototype reflectance-based meter and data collection software will be constructed and compared to readings obtained using the current ?gold standard? Konica Minolta spectrophotometer. Secondly, the POC assay will be validated through performance testing using a G6PD-deficient whole blood specimen bank provided by the Program for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH). Concordance of the data obtained from 20 samples for the proposed assay will be compared to the World Health Organization?s (WHO) approved spectrophotometric method for measuring G6PD and an FDA approved method for measuring Hgb. Success will be indicated by an R2 > 0.95, which demonstrates linear equivalency, as well as a demonstration that 90% of the data points fall within 2 sigma of each value. A POC assay that can simultaneously screen patients for both G6PD deficiency and Hgb levels will allow clinicians to treat patients with P. vivax and P. ovale malaria infections effectively and aid in the eradication of malaria.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is a substantial reduction of leakage in high-density polyethylene (HDPE) pipes. HDPE is a type of plastic commonly used for water, oil, and gas distribution pipe systems. Billions of gallons of treated water are lost daily across the US due to leaking pipes, resulting in massive revenue loss, environmental and property damage, and energy waste. Furthermore, millions of metric tons of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, escape every year into the atmosphere through leaking pipes. Most leaks occur at pipe joints and by wirelessly monitoring each joint for leaks, as a part of a smart infrastructure network, major leak reduction can be achieved. The commercial impact of the project is extensive, as smart infrastructure networks are increasingly being implemented and expanded, sensor and wireless communication technology has advanced significantly in recent years, and the rate of piping infrastructure installations, replacements, and repairs are accelerating across the US and globally.

    The proposed project aims to demonstrate a prototype capable of detecting a leak in electrofusion joints and wirelessly communicate the leak to an external network. Such joint monitoring system is highly desirable as pipe leaks can go undetected for an extended period of time. Moreover, once detected, leaks can be difficult and expensive to locate, especially as pipes are commonly buried underground or situated at hard-to-reach or remote locations. The challenge that comes with this  is to provide a reliable local power source for the sensing unit that can be on standby for up to 50 years. A second challenge is to generate a signal, powered by the local power source, that can be transmitted to the surface and notify a leak to an external signal receiver. A water-activated battery combined with a radio-frequency identification (RFID) transmitter will be developed for this purpose. RFID technology is extensively used in a broad range of industries due to its low-cost and good reliability . This technology is, therefore, an excellent candidate for providing an affordable joint leak detection system.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to help identify people that have paroxysmal or asymptomatic cardiac arrhythmias before they become dangerous. Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia, and the prevalence of AF increases with age. AF has a profound impact on longevity and quality of life. Patients typically develop paroxysmal, short-lived episodes of the arrhythmia and are frequently asymptomatic. This often leads to delays in diagnosis of AF until later stages when the arrhythmia is more persistent. Even short episodes of paroxysmal AF are associated with increased risk for stroke, heart failure, hospitalization, and death. The population with undiagnosed AF is substantial and studies have shown that continuous ECG monitoring for more than 3 years is required to achieve close to 100% AF detection. Current 30-day monitors detect 5% of paroxysmal and asymptomatic cases, since events must occur while the monitor is being worn. An armband-based approach offers a way to overcome the current restrictions in chest based monitors and bridges the gap between short-duration 30-day monitors and long-term implanted monitors.


    The proposed project uses an armband-based device to capture electrocardiogram (ECG) and electromyogram (EMG) signals on the upper arm using a waterproof and wireless device. The sensors are made from a composite material that can operate both wet and dry and does not require adhesives or hydrogels to capture all aspects of the waveforms. The challenge with the upper arm is that the ECG signals have less magnitude then over-the-heart and it is necessary to remove motion / noise artifacts as well as EMG signals to create a clean ECG signal. The research is focused on embedding algorithms into the device and testing and refining them for removing motion and noise artifacts that are captured by an accelerometer and to remove EMG signals. After a clean signal is established, proven algorithms for classification of the arrhythmias can be run embedded in the device.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project directly addresses the estimated $3.2 billion healthcare burden that develops from iatrogenic ureteral injuries that occur across the three million abdominal and pelvic surgeries being performed annually in the United States. Allotrope Medical creates innovative surgical solutions to improve patient outcomes and reduce procedure costs, directly addressing this situation.  Allotrope?s devices improve anatomical structure location and tissue identification thereby reducing the potential for injury while enhancing a surgeon?s confidence for reduced procedure time. Using smooth muscle stimulation, Allotrope?s StimSite is a sterile single-use, battery powered device that safely and reliably identifies the ureter location to avoid injury during these abdominal and pelvic surgical procedures. The ureter naturally contracts while draining urine from the kidneys into the bladder.  This smooth muscle structure is at risk of injury during dissection and pinching, the current standard surgical method, to mechanically elicit this contraction and thereby locating the ureter during surgery.  Allotrope has demonstrated StimSite?s ability to elicit the same contraction without surgical dissection, thereby diminishing the injury risk while also significantly reducing the surgical procedure time.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR Phase I project will advance the smooth muscle electrical stimulation technology used in StimSite. The project will improve product development and clinical understanding of the design's operating limits while increasing the product's clinical utility through better integration with the laparoscope's imaging system to display a stable indication of the ureter position.  This project encompasses three objectives:  First, using an instrumented breadboard device, the proprietary electrical pulse waveform will be studied characterizing how varying the waveform parameters affect tissue contraction responses.  Second, the performance of the preferred waveform will be evaluated in a porcine model to confirm in-vivo performance of a stand-alone configuration. Third, available image processing software will be evaluated to track and trace the ureter contraction and retain a road-map of the ureter position displayed on the monitor after the ureter has relaxed and is no longer directly visualized.  These three objectives will substantially advance Allotrope's smooth muscle electrical stimulation technology platform for the current device use and targeted future applications in esophageal, stomach and bowel tissue identification, etc.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project achieves a widespread earthquake sensor network in the earthquake-prone regions. With this wide prevalence of the sensor network, this smart, real-time earthquake detection system can detect an earthquake within a second near an epicenter and notify the other users away from the epicenter before the shakings arrive, effectively creating an earthquake early warning system for society. This same infrastructure of the smart earthquake monitoring system can be transformed to detect other natural hazards such as landslides, volcano eruptions, mine explosions, generating larger social and economic benefits. With this technology, instead of some sparse seismic recordings that we have currently, we can collect dense earthquake data from tens of thousands of locations in cities, providing a block-by-block risk-assessment of earthquake hazards in cities. This dense data promises several orders of magnitude improvement in the current earthquake hazard maps and helps the first responders, catastrophic modelers, primary insurance and reinsurance companies, city planners, and building owners to better assess the earthquake hazard risks. The granular level of the risk maps has the potential to increase the awareness of earthquake hazard risk in society.

    The proposed project achieves a dense and hybrid seismic network using smartphones, tablets, and stationary IoT devices. A potential outcome of this project is a next-generation Earthquake Early Warning System with a sub-second response that repurposes smartphones, tablets, and other sensors of a large IoT ecosystem for the earthquake sensor network. To achieve the performance under a second, a new earthquake early warning system that scales the massive data streaming from multiple sources, enables sensor and server communication in the fraction of a second, finally builds a new push notification framework to alert hundreds of thousands in less than a second.

    This SBIR Phase I project aims to further the development a novel nanoparticle-based synthetic platelet technology for the treatment of internal, non-compressible hemorrhage after traumatic injury. Trauma is the leading killer of people aged 1-46, and uncontrollable hemorrhage after injury is the cause of 35% of pre-hospital trauma deaths and 90% of military combat casualties. This is because there are currently no pre-hospital treatment options for internal, non-compressible hemorrhage. If the patient reaches a medical treatment facility in time, the current standard of care is transfusion with blood products, including platelets. However, natural platelet products suffer from shortage in supply (due to donor shortage), difficulty in portability, high risk of bacterial contamination, very short shelf life (3-5 days), requirement of blood typing and cross matching, and multiple biologic side effects (e.g. immune response). Therefore, there exists a significant clinical need for a synthetic platelet surrogate that can address the above limitations and can be administered at point-of-injury or during en route care to stop the bleeding earlier and potentially save lives. Beyond the potential clinical and commercial impact, the proposed research will also provide multi-disciplinary educational and research opportunities in major STEM areas at undergraduate level to create future scientists and engineers.

    A synthetic platelet technology has been developed that can simulate the hemostatic mechanisms and capabilities of natural platelets while allowing large-scale manufacturing, sterilization, long shelf-life and portability. The technology consists of a platelet-mimetic lipid-based nanoparticle, heteromultivalently surface-decorated with three types of small synthetic peptide ligands that render cooperative mechanisms of binding to von Willebrand Factor (vWF) and collagen (platelet-mimetic injury site-selective adhesion mechanisms) and binding to stimulated form of GPIIb-IIIa on active platelets (platelet-mimetic injury site-directed aggregation mechanism). This patented design is unique in that it is currently the only design that combines these adhesion and aggregation properties of natural platelets on a single synthetic platform. Preliminary studies have established the platelet-mimetic functional mechanisms in vitro as well as its significant hemostatic therapy capability in vivo in small (mouse) and large (pig) animal models of hemorrhage in both prophylactic and emergency administration frameworks. Building on these promising results, this project aims to conduct translationally-directed studies to address technical hurdles associated with manufacturing the synthetic platelets with batch-to-batch consistency and long shelf life (>1 year) at a range of storage conditions (widely varying temperatures, altitudes, etc), which would be highly relevant in austere civilian and military applications.

    such as nanoparticles and microcapsules. While mechanical pumps are conventionally
    used to drive fluid flow, chemical \"pumps\" can also propel fluid by using chemical
    reaction networks to create gradients in chemical concentrations and fluid densities.
    Researchers in the NSF Center for Chemo-Mechanical Assembly (CCMA) are creating
    new transformative tools to enable unprecedented control over fluid flow and particle
    organization in confined environments. These precisely controlled fluid flows
    enable the design of self-powered, self-sustaining systems that organize particles
    and are capable of performing complex functions such as an autonomous nanoparticle
    system that detects a chemical source and collectively delivers a response chemical
    to it resulting in a vital analysis or creation of a novel structure. The CCMA
    team includes expertise in catalysis, synthetic chemistry, physical chemistry,
    fluid flow, and modeling. In addition to providing the chemistry community with
    new chemical reaction network tools, CCMA is also contributing to science and
    technology workforce development by training students in multidisciplinary experimental
    and modeling techniques. Through its industry affiliates program, CCMA is engaging
    industry in student training and technology transfer. Concurrent with the research,
    the team is launching a vigorous program of education and outreach to the public.
    This includes expanding undergraduate and graduate research opportunities for
    underrepresented groups in research-based careers. The team is also participating
    in several large-scale public outreach programs including public lectures, designing
    hands-on traveling exhibits, and teaming with museums and science centers. \n\nThrough
    collaborative research that combines innovative modeling and experimental studies,
    the NSF CCI Phase I: Center for Chemo-Mechanical Assembly (CCMA) is harnessing
    catalytic chemical reactions to introduce spatiotemporal chemical gradients that
    drive the flow of a surrounding fluid. This flow, in turn, enables the manipulation
    of the collective behavior of suspended particles to drive new modes of dynamic
    self-organization. The Center is developing novel approaches to cause directed
    transport of nano- and micron-scale materials, control particle organization in
    confined chambers, and establish new chemical routes for regulating non-equilibrium
    structure formation from particles in solution. These studies are providing the
    chemistry community with fundamentally new tools and knowledge, including new
    chemistries for the creation of catalytic cascades; determination of design rules
    for chemical feedback loops; demonstration of new modes of out-of-equilibrium
    assembly; and progress toward new understanding of the nonlinear behavior and
    auto-amplification emerging from these systems. Potential applications include
    the creation of standalone microfluidic devices that autonomously perform multi-stage
    chemical reactions and assays for portable biomedical applications; automated
    materials assembly in harsh environments; and small-scale factories that can operate
    autonomously to build microscale components for use in fine instrumentation and
    robotic systems, and, in parallel, to screen for optimal reaction parameters yielding
    micro-machines with specified properties. To generate excitement and public appreciation
    about this emerging area of chemistry, the CCMA team is participating in several
    large-scale public outreach programs at the participating institutions, including
    public lectures, hands-on traveling exhibits, and museum and science center projects."

    Transfer (STTR) Phase I project lies in treating clinical and subclinical inattention
    within a few minutes, by simply listening to algorithmically-generated music.
    Failures of attention have dramatic clinical and non-clinical ramifications. In
    the non-clinical side, nearly 90% of people attest to wasting time in the workplace,
    and this reduced efficiency has an estimated $1 T economic impact in the US alone.
    At the clinical level, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), the best-characterized
    attentional deficit, affects over 8M children in the US, with the leading solution
    being a near-epidemic growth of prescriptions stimulants. However, over 4 M American
    adults do not meet all the criteria to be diagnosed with ADHD (and therefore cannot
    be prescribed medication), and have no convenient alternatives for treatment.
    Brain.fm is a non-invasive auditory stimulation platform designed to treat inattention.
    It generates music designed specifically to stimulate attentional networks in
    our brain by exploiting the latest neuroscience concepts of how neurons entrain
    to stimulus rhythms. Our objective is for Brain.fm to become a validated, non-invasive
    therapeutic tool for Attention to help everyone who suffers from mind wandering,
    regardless of whether they meet diagnostic criteria for ADHD. \n\nThe proposed
    project is aimed at experimentally demonstrating generalizable changes in attention
    through auditory stimulation. For decades, neuroscientists have observed wave-like
    activity in the brain and related them to attentional states. The ability to change
    attentional states, via noninvasive brain stimulation, would be greatly desirable
    for everyday functioning as well as crucial for understanding how brain waves
    relate to behavior. The proposed project tests a novel auditory neuroscience-informed
    platform solution for delivering noninvasive brain stimulation through music.
    In addition to establishing a revolutionary method to enhance attention noninvasively
    by tuning brain waves through comprehensive behavioral and fMRI studies, we test
    the efficacy of this method to treat inattention, especially in adults with Attention
    Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Key outcomes of this project are: 1) non
    clinical (but Institutional Review Board-approved) studies that determine how
    this auditory therapy impacts attention on an adult ADHD prone population, 2)
    a deeper understanding of the neurophysiological mechanisms of attention and neuronal
    entrainment, and 3)optimization of our product by testing different versions of
    our algorithmically generated music on our existing customer base. Results are
    expected to show how purpose-built acoustic stimulation can support the neuronal
    oscillations underlying sustained attention, thus boosting productivity and well-being."

    The commercial impact of the personalized e-rehabilitation system, which will

    the system will increase revenues by increasing the number of visits per patient

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to demonstrate a new way of integrating energy harvesting technologies in standard electronic circuits. This offers the opportunity to produce small sensors and devices in remote locations that can collect information, monitor conditions, and transmit data without the need to replace batteries. Small batteries are unsuitable for electronics that are remotely deployed, driving interest to harvest electrical energy directly from the movement and vibration of machinery. Currently, energy harvesting is too large, expensive, and inefficient for practical deployment. If energy harvesting can be made small and inexpensive, it can enable a large suite of products and services for industrial, civil, and agricultural remote monitoring. This project offers the potential to bring energy harvesting to electronics in a way that allows highly efficient energy conversion from vibrating or moving machinery, while maintaining small size and low cost. The ability to embed tiny moving parts directly within printed circuits is highly innovative, and dynamic energy harvesting is an excellent application of this technology. The patented manufacturing processes can be performed using domestic electronics manufacturing infrastructure helping to bring next-generation manufacturing to the U.S.

    The proposed project seeks to demonstrate a new way to embed dynamic energy harvesting devices directly within printed circuit boards, enabling micro energy production at low cost and small size. The project builds on patented manufacturing processes that leverages conventional electronics manufacturing infrastructure?devices can be built having feature sizes in microns without the need for expensive silicon fabrication foundries. The project will explore designs and fabrication processes for small, efficient vibrating units, culminating in the production of multiple devices in a single small footprint circuit board. Significant effort will be on the development of small, efficient vibrating units that can be manufactured cheaply and in large quantities, yet embedded directly within printed circuits. Three manufacturing rounds are anticipated, producing real devices that can be experimentally tested and measured. The successful completion of this project will demonstrate electrical energy production in a small printed circuit board (approximately the size of a credit card), targeting 100 microwatts to power sensing and telemetry electronics.

    This STTR Phase I project is focused on improving the energy density, safety and ultra-low temperature capability of battery devices. Conventional batteries fall short of these critical requirements for next-generation electric vehicle technologies, which are necessary to reduce emissions and the nation?s reliance on fossil fuel imports. Although the eventual goal of the proposed technology is to enter automotive markets, it may have an equally strong impact for applications in other areas requiring energy storage at low-temperatures. For example, multiple efforts aim to enable high-atmosphere telecommunications to further global connectivity to the internet, particularly in remote locations of the globe in third world countries whose standard of living could be enhanced with greater communication and education. Further, the proposed chemistry could also potentially be useful in electrochemical deposition of difficult to plate metals such as titanium or silicon for use in the aerospace, medical or high tech industries, areas which will ensure the U.S. remains internationally competitive while increasing job opportunity and tax revenue from emerging technologies. It is also a priority of this STTR to coordinate with the partner research institution to providing training and internship opportunities to graduate and undergraduate students from underrepresented communities in this research work to further improve our national industry by training the next generation workforce to better be prepared for industry and higher-education.

    This project aims to develop a novel electrolyte chemistry for next generation energy storage devices which has potential to address these three critical areas (energy density, safety, wide temperature operation). While conventional electrolyte chemistry commonly uses solvent solutions which are typically liquid at room temperature, this project will explore the use of solvent solutions which are gaseous at room temperature and liquefied under moderate pressures. Preliminary work on this novel electrolyte chemistry has shown high performance at ultra-low temperatures, enabling many high-atmosphere and aerospace applications without need for additional thermal management and engineering. In addition, a reversible battery shut-down mechanism at high temperatures, inherent in the electrolyte chemistry, allow for strong mitigation of thermal runaway for improved battery safety. Finally, high potential for a substantial increase in energy density with use of next-generation electrode materials has been shown to be possible. The focus of this project will be to develop these novel electrolytes and demonstrate superior performance in a full cell device with application to the automotive industry and low-temperature markets. The underlying fundamental chemistry with these new materials is a relatively new field and it is hoped these materials will lead to advances in next-generation energy storage devices and other technologies, leading to new industries, job growth and beyond.

    are intended to help them to understand such concepts by representing shapes/
    forms in a fast-refreshing tactile way, helping to overcome that learning obstacle.
    Furthermore, the commercial success will be in producing and selling such devices
    (for different market sub-segments).  Tactile Analogics expects market adoption
    of 37% of USA blind students, 90% of blind educational centers, 40% of museums,
    and 7% of blind adults to use it in as a working tool. In collaboration with Sharp,
    Tactile Analogics will explore also a functional digital display with micro-valves
    embedded, the market will widen to give haptics experience to mobile users in
    a 2-sense data outputs via sight and tactile means. The company expects to generate
    revenues of over $200m after year five of production.  \n \n\nThis Small Business
    Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is attacking the problem that visually
    impaired people have to not just learn, but to understand images and visual information,
    with impacts on their quality of daily life.  Current cost of producing a single
    pinned printed page is about $20 USD per page and takes about 2 weeks to prepare
    and print.  Tactile Analogics? devices will offer a rapid fast-refreshing speed
    of up to 30 times per second, allowing the creation of frames according to the
    image that they are representing.  This solution will enable blind to not depend
    on pinned paper to understand images or shapes. In general, this is a haptic way
    to retrieve information and technically not limited to blind people.  The opportunity
    is related with providing a new type of information retrieval where sight is not
    needed.  The research objectives are to overcome design problems of our proven
    technology of micro-valves, where Tactile Analogics would be able to offer a standard
    tablet-size display for an area of 15cm by 20cm (2700 pneumatic valves).  Furthermore,
    the air chamber and the information conversion-actuator manipulation are two other
    problems to overcome.  The anticipated results are the allocation of not just
    the 2700 pneumatic micro-valves, but also even for larger displays.  Once the
    technology is proven, it will allow a variety of applications across multiple
    industries, with the possibility of creating many commercially successful product
    lines."

    This SBIR Phase I project will develop the necessary technology and manufacturing workflows to provide medical professionals with extremely realistic physical models of tissues and organs. The models will be manufactured rapidly (within a few hours), inexpensively, and on-demand. They will be patient-specific based on the patient?s CT and MRI scan data.  This will have profound implications on the planning of complex medical procedures such as tumor removal and will enable medical professionals and their teams to practice patient-specific surgical scenarios. This will improve surgical outcome, generate efficiencies in the operating room and decrease medical errors which, by some accounts, are the third largest cause of death in the United States. The ability to 3D print realistic human organ models will also provide medical students with a way to practice medical procedures with a wide degree of diversity. This will accelerate the learning rate and expand the breadth of training experiences.  Similarly, the models will provide a way for medical professionals to practice rare, high-risk procedures on-demand. The proposed 3D models will become a central part of the medical simulation toolbox and will enable a new generation of surgical planning and education.

    The ability to manufacture extremely realistic physical models rapidly, inexpensively, and on-demand relies on a novel multimaterial additive manufacturing process with a closed-feedback loop enabled by machine vision. This new process manufactures objects layer by layer, each layer made from a discrete set of elements, where each element is built from one material from a pallette of materials. The use of the closed-feedback loop system allows incorporating both liquids and solids with a wide range of mechanical and appearance properties. The development of a material palette that is necessary to mimic properties of real tissues will be a crucial part of the project. This material palette will be expanded by spatially combining base materials into composite structures. The second main thrust of the project relies on a software design workflow that translates geometric and material specifications describing a simulation model (e.g., an organ or a tissue) into multimaterial volumetric data. The volumetric data will be used as input to the multimaterial printing platform. The new design workflow requires development of modeling approaches that go beyond traditional, boundary-based CAD representations.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be to innovate a novel patient tracking system, which will improve robotic surgery usability in an intra-operative environment. Robotic surgery is becoming ubiquitous across various medical procedures, and data continues to show improved clinical results. However, usability challenges impede broader adoption. This project will combine multiple tracking modalities, including mechanical and optical tracking, to create a hybrid tracking technology that allows for the advantages of each modality. This will optimize patient range of motion while minimizing line-of-sight challenges. This patient tracking technology can be used in conjunction with an existing robotic surgery system for dental implant procedures, which comprise a significant market opportunity. Dental implants are the standard of care for tooth replacement, and the dental implant market in the US is over $1 billion and growing nearly 8% per year with more than 14 million implants being placed annually worldwide. This technique can be used not only to revolutionize dental implant surgery, where the system is currently applied, but also to potentially create opportunities in other cranial procedures, which are otherwise burdened by invasive, cumbersome tracking technologies that impede intra-operative usability.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate the feasibility of the first hybrid patient tracking device that combines mechanical and optical tracking methods. Optical tracking systems require that cameras have direct line-of-sight to several tracked markers in the surgical field, which poses a significant challenge to the surgeon and assistants that have to carefully avoid blocking the camera's field-of-view. Mechanical tracking systems limit a patient's range of motion and can be bulky. The success of this project will lead to the development of a robotic surgery system for dental implant procedures that encompasses: 1) pre-operative CT-based planning software, 2) a visual guidance system that provides on-screen graphics like a GPS system, 3) a hybrid optical and mechanical tracking system that monitors the patient position, and 4) a robot arm that physically grasps the drill at the same time as the surgeon in order to provide haptic feedback, constraining the surgeon to match the planned osteotomy. This system enables minimally invasive, flapless surgery that is shown to result in less pain for the patient and faster surgery. It is designed to be easy to use and seamlessly integrate into the surgeon's workflow.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the practical deployment of a computer-vision based yield estimation system in fruit orchards.  This will provide fruit farmers with a useful tool in planning their harvest and sales, as well as in managing the long-term health of their plants.  This will potentially reduce the inherent risk in fruit growing, thereby improving the affordability and availability of fresh fruit in the US.  Better certainty may particularly help small growers, because they have less existing capability to manage risk.  Furthermore, by allowing adoption of precision agriculture techniques techniques to high value crops, this project may help save water and contribute to reduction of runoff pollution from fertilizer and chemicals.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the problem of vision-based fruit detection and mapping of fruit, for purposes of yield mapping.  The research objectives are to improve the commercial usability and robustness of existing yield-mapping approaches, so that they can be applied in production fruit orchards.  The anticipated technical results of this project include demonstration of useful yield mapping of apples, in a variety of real world production orchard environments, in a variety of weather and lighting conditions.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be achieved through shifting the paradigm of waterway maintenance into a more regular occurrence, giving way to reduced pollutant levels in waterways, since they will be promptly removed instead of allowing them to accumulate toxins, and increase property values, utilization, and income within the marina industry. Additionally, embedded sensor intelligence and continuous waterway monitoring will grant the community and dredging regulatory agencies increased visibility and understanding of the health of the marine life in the waterway and allow them to more closely monitor environmental violations. With widespread adoption and further development, the innovation could potentially have far-reaching benefits in assisting with water and energy security by keeping inlet canals and reservoirs that comprise our society?s infrastructure clean and running at peak efficiency.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will aim to design, develop, and test an intelligent suction tip for use in year-round sediment removal in waterways. Current sediment removal technologies are destructive to marine ecosystems and costly to employ. As such, this project aims to develop an intelligent suction tip for marine life avoidance during robotic sediment removal in waterways. The project activities include the design and rapid prototyping of a suction tip filter that prevents fish entrainment, design and implementation of water quality sensors for environmental niche modeling, in-house saltwater testing, and marine representative freshwater testing.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is establishment of sustainable, cost-effective technology to mitigate local volatile organic chemicals (VOCs) and other indoor air pollutants by using photocatalysts to effectively destroy them at their point of generation. VOC exposure is pervasive in many commercial environments, including nail salons, where employees work with materials that emit VOCs which can pose health risk without adequate protection. The proposed innovation addresses key gaps limiting the successful application of photocatalysts to these environments, specifically the need to eliminate by-products that may form during VOC destruction and the use of visible light-emitting diodes (LEDs) as alternatives to the harmful ultraviolet (UV) lights currently employed for photocatalysis. Novel photocatalytic materials will be applied to achieve safe, facile implementation at the point of exposure in commercial activities where employees are directly impacted. An improved understanding of the activity of innovative photocatalysts in the visible light range will enhance the overall understanding of photocatalytic materials. The technology will also form the core foundation of high performance and attractive residential products, which will improve indoor air quality in homes. Together, these applications hold the promise to broadly impact society by providing improved health for millions of people.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to improve indoor air quality by developing a technology platform to enable efficient and effective point-of-use VOC removal in commercial, residential, and select industrial environments. Photocatalysts are widely known as effective chemical scrubbers and disinfectants. When exposed to UV light, the surfaces become chemically active via formation of reactive oxygen species. This surface chemistry has been proven effective to decompose toxic VOCs and to kill spores, bacteria, and viruses. Because it is harmful to humans, the use of UV light to activate the photocatalyst greatly limits implementation of this technology. Additionally, ineffective photocatalyst designs can result in incomplete decomposition of the VOCs. The goal of the current research is to develop a visible-LED-activated photocatalyst engineered to completely convert target VOCs to carbon dioxide and water. The improvements to the photocatalyst design will enable its implementation in luminaires that are easily integrated into the work environment at the point of VOC generation. The decomposition of VOCs at concentrations typically found in commercial and home environments will be explored using the developed photocatalyst, with particular attention given to the mitigation of by-products and the enhancement of photocatalyst lifetime.

    alternative to Diesel engines for use in heavy-duty applications such as on-road
    transportation, off-road farm equipment, and stationary power generation. Currently,
    Diesel engines are used in all of these applications because they are robust and
    powerful. Unfortunately, they also produce significant smog, soot, and greenhouse
    gases that are damaging to individuals and the environment. In contrast, the engines
    developed under this project will have cleaner exhaust while producing more power
    at increased efficiency, all while utilizing inexpensive alternative fuels. Since
    Diesel-fueled engines move 70% of the world's goods, and produce 30% of distributed
    power around the globe, these engines are inextricably linked to quality of life,
    and transformational improvements in their operation can have a large, broad,
    positive impact on society. This project's new engines will continue to provide
    essential services, but in a way that reduces operating costs (creating savings
    that can be passed on to consumers) and emissions (further saving consumers money,
    and improving air quality in heavily-trafficked regions). These engines will fulfill
    a critical market need for clean, powerful engine solutions, and can be integrated
    into existing American-made engine product lines, increasing manufacturing revenue,
    stimulating job creation, and ensuring that the United States will remain a global
    leader heavy-duty engine production.\n\n \nThis project will focus on enabling
    these clean, powerful engines by developing a novel, high-temperature combustion
    system that allows traditional engines to be adapted to burn alternative fuels
    in an efficient and soot-free manner. This requires integration of a unique combination
    of technologies, joined in a way that provides benefits far greater than those
    that can be achieved with the individual components in isolation. Removing any
    piece from this specific combination drastically reduces performance. Because
    each component plays a critical role, this project has high risk (as each subsystem
    must function properly), but its sophistication also presents a high barrier to
    similar efforts (since incorrect use of any component yields significantly worse
    results). This project will build on previous proof-of-concept data that verified
    the feasibility of this concept, and will focus on the development of key engine
    subsystems, seeking to mitigate risk enough that investment from the private sector
    is possible. At the end of the project, the subsystems will be integrated into
    a stationary power generator as a retrofit to an existing Diesel engine, adapting
    it for alternative fuel use. This would serve as a prototype platform for the
    technology?illustrating its increased efficiency and power, along with reduced
    emissions?and demonstrating the value of the technology to market incumbents,
    hopefully spurring a licensing arrangement for engine production."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes the development and demonstration of a prototype position sensor that will help convert hydraulic and pneumatic actuators into ?smart? devices.  The position sensor will enable built-in self-diagnostics, precise feedback control, energy efficient operation, faster industrial manufacturing and material handling processes, and safer operations on mobile vehicles that take locations of obstacles and danger zones automatically into account during motion. The value proposition of the new sensor comes from its lower cost, ease of installation, and its non-contacting operation.  This project will help a start-up company demonstrate the performance of its sensor on multiple actuator products provided by large industrial and off-road mobile companies.  This is expected to result in establishing the viability of the sensor, customer orders for the sensor, and growth in company revenues. The technology area addressed by the research in this project is smart sensors and the targeted market sector is industrial machines and off-road agriculture and construction vehicles.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a prototype position sensor that is production-ready and ready for field testing in real-world industrial and mobile vehicle applications.  The sensor utilizes a large-distance magnetic field model, redundant magnetic sensors on a single sensor board and adaptive estimation algorithms to provide a novel position sensor that is small, non-intrusive, non-contacting, easy to install and lower cost compared to other position sensors on the market.  The innovations in the sensor technology being developed include the use of a nonlinear estimation algorithm that avoids differentiation of complex nonlinear functions, provides more accuracy and is computationally efficient for implementation on a microprocessor.  The sensor also includes an auto-calibration algorithm that corrects for sensor location and orientation errors so as to ensure accurate performance with changing cylinders.  The research project will demonstrate the performance of the sensor prototype in the lab on multiple actuators provided by collaborating large industrial and off-road vehicle companies.

    a change in concept and technical paradigm for Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) technology,
    and as such shall significantly impact research and development in both industry
    and academia.  As discussed in the Technical Merits below, the proposed AFM is
    fast, smart, and more powerful in terms of imaging and probing local mechanics.
    \ The company has a track record of commercializing AFM controllers that are compatible
    with most all types of scanners, commercial and home-constructed.  Current AFM
    users can purchase the new scanner and/or controller to attain the enhanced performance.
    In addition, new AFM users are also anticipated especially in the areas of nanomaterials,
    devices and sensors, and multidimensional devices and materials where both high
    spatial and temporal resolutions are paramount.  Further, the combined high spatial
    resolution in conjunction with fast speed shall result in immediate advances in
    the fields of material development, surface coating, nanomaterial and nanodevice
    inspection and quality control, nanolithography, and tissue engineering.  Based
    on current market trends, sales are anticipated to reach $25M within the first
    three years.  The amount is likely higher given the forecasted growth of the global
    microscopy market. \n\nThe intellectual merit of this project includes three cutting
    edge improvements to current AFM: (1) faster image acquisition speed; (2) automated
    and rapid feature finding and tracking; (3) 1-2 orders of magnitude of improvement
    in speed and efficiency in nanomechanical imaging.  The ultra-high speed will
    be achieved by implementing a novel reconfigurable processor optimized for AFM
    into a unique hybrid, low-noise controller architecture, which is highly versatile
    and compatible with various known configurations of AFM microscopes from many
    different vendors.  In addition, the automatic feature finding and tracking functions
    will be accomplished using artificial intelligence directly in hardware and a
    novel scan pattern, completely different from current ?trace-retrace? scanning
    trajectory in current AFM.  These new and ?smart? approaches further speed up
    scanning and tracking speed.  Finally, the AFM will be able to produce nanomechanical
    images with high speed and accuracy using multifrequency spectroscopy. This concept
    has been proposed, and individual aspects have been demonstrated in isolation
    through simulations or lab prototypes over the past five years or more.  The faster
    and more powerful electronic controller shall enable the test and implementation
    of multifrequency spectroscopy technology in its full potential."

- abstractText: "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project seeks development
    of a novel dosimeter for 2-D mapping of radiation dose in real-time at sub-millimeter
    spatial resolution. The high spatial resolution of the dosimeter is essential
    in supporting stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and stereotactic body radiation
    therapy (SBRT) treatments. These rapidly emerging modalities deliver precise doses
    of radiation to small, well defined treatment sites while minimizing exposure
    of critical neighboring anatomy. With the annual number of SRS/SBRT treatments
    approaching 1,000,000 and growing 5-10% annually there is a market need for a
    dosimeter with sub-millimeter resolution and the capability of measuring in real-time.
    The routine pre-treatment verification of each patient therapy plan becomes a
    target application. The value of the market for the dosimeter alone exceeds $10
    million annually. The value is amplified through enablement of the safe and efficacious
    delivery of SRS and SBRT treatments.  Use of these modalities greatly impacts
    the efficiency of radiotherapy by substantially reducing the number of individual
    sessions in a course of treatment. The net result is lower cost for the treatment
    course, an increase in the number of patients/year for each linear accelerator
    equipment unit and a large reported improvement in patient outcomes.      \n\nThe
    intellectual merit of this project lies in combining and adapting key elements
    of two well-established commercial technologies, piezoelectric polymers and radiochromic
    film, to produce a hybrid dosimeter. This dosimeter preserves the high spatial
    resolution of radiochromic film while improving its usability by making the changes
    caused by radiation exposure to become detectable by electronic means in real-time.
    During use, the flexible, single-use piezoelectric array dosimeter (PARD) fits
    into a re-usable data acquisition electronics module that transmits a map of measured
    doses to a Medical Physicist outside the radiation cell. Radiochromic film, the
    only current dosimeter with sub-millimeter spatial resolution, is inconvenient
    owing to the long delay between exposure and measurement as well as the extra
    time and effort in facilitating the measurements. This drawback adversely impacts
    its usefulness in the day-to-day verification of patient treatment plans. The
    hybrid PARD product provides a dense, flexible array (0.1 mm spacing) of detectors
    with the unique ability for dose measurement at sub-millimeter resolution in real
    time. This overcomes key drawbacks of existing electronic array devices which

- abstractText: "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will investigate
    isolation pads made of a novel class of metamaterials to reduce seismic vibrations
    of equipment and buildings. Use of traditional seismic isolation materials often
    leads to restricted design spaces and needs expensive full-scale device testing,
    which make the technology unfeasible for extensive application. The internal architecture
    of the high-performance materials to be studied and optimized in this work can
    enlarge the design space to embrace objects as small as an expensive equipment
    and as large as a major bridge. Simplification of testing protocols due to the
    shift of the isolation property from the device to the material level adds to
    the Broader Impacts by making seismic isolation accessible for a wide range of
    applications. The high level of seismic protection provided by this technology
    constitutes an immediate value for commercial activities that require continuity
    of operations after earthquakes. The initial target is the fast growing market
    of data centers, with the potential for follow-on market in residential housing
    construction. The extensive application of the innovation has the potential of
    increasing the resiliency of communities in areas prone to seismic activity and
    reducing related direct and indirect losses. \n\nThe intellectual merit of this
    project derives from the development of an optimization framework for the internal
    architecture of metamaterials for enhanced seismic protection. There has not been
    a fundamental study to optimize metamaterials based on manufacturing tolerances,
    costs, and performance for seismic applications. This work will contribute to
    developing a set of design principles for optimized internal material architectures
    depending on desired seismic performance. Experimental investigations will be
    carried out to validate the methodology and to prove the feasibility of replacing
    device testing with material coupon testing to certify metamaterial pads for seismic
    isolation. This will include the investigation of processing methods to manufacture
    material assemblies with uniform mechanical properties, and will involve both
    static and dynamic testing of the material. The key technical objectives of the
    project are 1) the development of the optimization design framework based on manufacturing
    and seismic performance constraints, and 2) the material testing protocol to verify
    scalability and defect insensitivity of the material property. It is anticipated
    that the metamaterial architecture can be modulated to provide seismic isolation
    property beyond state of the art seismic isolation devices, and can be scaled
    from material coupons to large assemblies without significant property modification."

    This STTR Phase I projects aims to address major limitations in the analysis of pharmaceuticals that are based on proteins, a group of therapeutics known as biologics.  Current methods for sample preparation and analysis of these drugs require highly trained staff and expensive equipment to execute the multitude of different analytical approaches that are employed to characterize these molecules. Both personnel and equipment costs combine to limit the number of drug candidates evaluated by pharma companies, makes it more difficult for regulatory agencies to reproduce data provided in applications and makes it difficult to identify counterfeit drugs. The company aims to address this issue by creating a highly flexible sample preparation device based on a fluidic channel that operates at reduced pressure. Proteins trapped within the channel can undergo digestion, reduction, alkylation and other common sample preparation procedures in an unattended and automated fashion. Subsequently, prepared samples may be eluted at high concentration, ready for downstream analysis.  By dramatically reducing the equipment costs and reducing the required expertise for sample preparation, the company?s technology will have a large impact on the number of drug candidates that are evaluated by pharma companies, it will make it easier for regulatory agencies to reproduce data provided by manufacturers, and it will improve their ability to detect counterfeit drugs. All of these benefits will result in more and cheaper biologics making it to the market, ultimately improving the health and wellness of the populace.

    The company?s device combines concepts of diafiltration, asymmetric flow field flow fractionation and filter assisted sample preparation to create an automated sample preparation platform that avoids the use of robotics. By avoiding robotics and high pressure, the platform can operate with increased robustness and dramatically reduced cost. The proposed research aims to demonstrate the ability of the device to perform common sample preparation steps, such as reduction/denaturation, digestion, and deglycosylation and assess issues of reproducibility, reliability and carryover. While many of the workflows described herein have been demonstrated in molecular weight cutoff filters, implementation of these within a fluidic channel will directly advance the company?s understanding of the mechanisms of loss in sample preparation, provide a refined estimate of the cost savings that might be achieved in real world applications, and improve our understanding of transport for small molecules across these membranes.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will support the development, characterization, and commercialization of nonconductive, magnetically loaded, carbon fiber (CF) composite microwave absorbers. Manufacturers use absorbers to protect their products from unwanted Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) and to meet Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations and standards. EMI from external and internal sources can degrade the operation and performance of electronics. The demand for EMI absorbing materials that are cost effective, lightweight, thin, flexible and wide-spectrum continues to grow rapidly as microwave communications and mobile technologies become ubiquitous. The overall EMI shielding market exceeded $5.4 billion in 2015 and is expected to grow to $7.8 billion in the next 5 years. Absorber materials developed in this project can be applied to almost any type of antenna, circuit board, cable, gasket or enclosure. The project goal and broader impacts of this technology are development of lightweight, thin, high performance, microwave absorber materials that provide increased energy efficiency, design flexibility, reduced costs and improved connectivity for a wide range of markets, applications, products and devices. The product is suitable for many market sectors including automotive, consumer electronics, telecom and aerospace where thin, lightweight and wide-spectrum response is needed.

    The intellectual merit of the project will be the creation of new CF composites for microwave absorption. This project will measure and define the fundamental electromagnetic absorption parameters of these composites in the 1 - 12 GHz range. Characterization data such as dielectric constants, complex electric permittivity, magnetic permeability, loss tangents and layer thickness of the absorbers will be measured and derived. Such parameterization is essential for simulation modeling and design optimization of such absorbers for various markets and applications. Absorber attenuation and frequency response will be simulated and validated with laboratory transmission line and reflectivity testing. These composites use both magnetic and dielectric mechanisms to absorb microwave energy. Composite CF absorber materials are nonconductive and rely on insertion loss and impedance matching and/or cavity resonance effects. Processes, techniques and equipment needed for commercial production will be investigated. Graduate students and faculty will be supported in development of test, measurement and modeling techniques. The execution of the project will demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of using CF composites as microwave absorbing materials and will provide a pathway to commercialization and product design. Successful completion of the project will create new high performance materials for the aerospace, automotive and consumer markets.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the development and validation of technologies that enable electric energy systems to operate reliably and affordably with very large amounts of renewable energy. Clean, reliable and affordable electricity is vital to modern society.  However the variability of wind and solar generation can lead to catastrophic grid reliability problems if real-time demand does not match the supply.  This project will develop and demonstrate a system to manage distributed (e.g., rooftop) solar photovoltaic systems operating with and without local electrical energy storage (i.e., batteries) in a way that extracts the most value for the customer, while simultaneously improving the reliability of the electricity infrastructure.  The project will leverage algorithms inspired by those used by millions of devices to send data over the Internet.  Like Internet data, energy will be delivered in discrete energy packets. These packets are coordinated independently, anonymously, and fairly to simultaneously solve real-world grid problems and provide value to end-users. The result of this project will be an integrated software-as-a-service and hardware solution in which customers gain incentives for participating and electricity industry members realize savings by reducing infrastructure needs, such as additional fossil fuel generation.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will enable the decentralized, randomized, and bottom-up coordination of two- and four-quadrant power-electronic inverters attached to solar photovoltaic and electric battery storage systems. In contrast to competing, centralized, top-down scheduling approaches, the proposed technology enables inverters to regulate both active and reactive power output according to an automaton that undergoes probabilistic state-transitions based on both real-time local measurements and communication with an aggregator. By incorporating local measurements, the method ensures that the energy needs of the end-use consumer are met while providing flexibility to a load aggregator or electric utility. This flexibility will enable distribution utilities to manage feeder power flows, losses, and voltage constraints. The probabilistic nature of the coordination prevents harmful synchronization effects, such as oscillations, while maintaining privacy of end-consumers through anonymous interactions akin to how data packets are routed on the Internet. Upon completion of the project, a commercially viable, human-friendly software-as-a-service (SaaS) technology will be demonstrated that implements this decentralized approach to coordinate distributed inverters in a manner that is compatible with modern grid operations.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will be to significantly increase recovery efficiency and decrease ecological footprint. The ecological footprint is decreased by reducing the amount of water required to produce oil and gas from many low permeability U.S. unconventional plays. Further, it will provide access to the vast reserves of potential oil and gas (estimated at greater than 2 trillion barrels) stored as immature organic material helping to enhance energy independence for the US. The new methods will enhance production of oil and gas from a controllable volume surrounding development wells.  The proposed methods will replace the rapid declines in well productivity of fracked wells, and the accompanying typically less than 10% recovery of hydrocarbons in place, by a strategy which will construct multi-year oil and gas "factories" which will have continuous, predictable, twenty year production lifetimes. Increased recovery factors through increased efficiency will enhance the value of existing plays and provide a step-change in sustainable energy production while lowering environmental impact through reducing surface disruption and minimizing water use and disposal.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop the models necessary to simulate
    the Radio Frequency (RF) waterless stimulation process, and to provide laboratory and numerical data to support that model. A self-consistent model of the RF system and its downhole environment, is required to define the conditions for which RF stimulation makes economic sense, and to optimize system design for a given target play. Project objectives are to 1) demonstrate design of a RF system which mitigates the previous problems found with RF heating, 2) test in the laboratory the effects of RF heating on reservoir rock subject to realistic in situ conditions to understand the resultant crack field and accompanying permeability enhancement, including the impact of RF heating on immature kerogen, 3) model the resulting stress and fracture fields with sufficient fidelity to make predictions for oil and gas recovery, and 4) use this information to form a self consistent model of the process so that various shale plays can be evaluated. A commercial multiphysics numerical modeling approach will be used to simulate the physical processes that occur including feedback to account for temperature increases and the impacts of in situ stress and structural complexity.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project relates to the management of clotting
    and bleeding which is a major clinical challenge that costs > $100B healthcare system burden. In
    the United States, it affects more than ten million patients of major surgery, trauma,
    cardiovascular disease, stroke and cancers. The underlying biology is a complex orchestration of
    protein and cellular pathways that react in the context of blood flow. Proven diagnostic tools that
    capture this complexity, and also meet the constraints of diverse challenges do not exist. This
    project intends to create a novel modular hemostasis test platform using proprietary microsystem
    modules deployed in configurable cartridges tailored to meet clinical requirements. Initially a
    3D microelectrode based platelet function test module will be developed and optimized with
    potential for best in class performance following multi-scale optimization of the dynamic,
    physical diagnostic environment.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop a simple, low
    cost platelet function assay (PFA) with the objective of delivering best in class performance via
    multiscale optimization of the local biophysical diagnostic environment. Multiplate Electrode
    Aggregometry (MEA), a macroscale impedance-based device has already shown promise, yet
    remains cumbersome and has suboptimal classification accuracy between patient subsets. In
    MEA tests, as with most PFAs, the role of local fluid shear and macro/microscale physical
    environment remains largely neglected despite their well-recognized role in platelet response.
    Preliminary work suggests untapped potential in controlling and modifying PFA performance.
    By optimizing these signals with respect to clinical end points and subpopulation differentiation,
    this shear-based micro-platelet function test modules stand to revolutionize platelet function
    testing for the broadest possible benefits.

    The broader reaching impacts/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research project stems from the development and application of a new generation of cost-effective devices that can efficiently recover, preserve and quantify airborne microbes in near real time.  An improved ability to characterize the microbiology of indoor aerosols has a multitude of important engineering and public health benefits for urban society. This includes a vastly improved ability to monitor bioaerosols in health care settings; in water-damaged buildings; in plane/rail/bus transportation centers; as well as other high-density public venues.  Through this work, emerging aerosol technology will be optimized and deployed in portable instrumentation that reports what currently marketed aerosol monitoring equipment cannot provide: the identity, distribution and abundance of airborne microorganisms indoors.  This approach provides an unprecedented path to compile large exposure databases, which enable the scientific and medical community to better understand the potential effects of indoor microbial air pollution.  Compared to conventional aerosol sampling, these new filter-less devices require little human oversite, communicate aerosol data to cloud-based servers, and preserve bioaerosol samples with exceptional fidelity.  These next generation instruments provide an innovative, unobtrusive and practical method for surveying the indoor air we breathe every day, in near real-time.

    This STTR Phase I project integrates portable lasers for real-time microbe enumeration, with humidity controls that efficiently recover bacteria, fungi and pollen from indoor air. This advanced equipment assembly accurately counts, preserves and concentrates airborne microbes for stringent biochemical analysis that is relevant to public health.  The opportunity for this new instrumentation leverages the fundamental technological advantages it has over conventional sampling equipment, which until now predominantly relies on filtering large quantities of indoor air.   The mechanical stresses microbes must endure during conventional air filtration, seriously compromises the accuracy of airborne microbial analyses.  The research objective of this work is to challenge this novel instrumentation array with known quantities of airborne microbes that commonly inhabit the indoor environment.  Using widely accepted engineering and biochemistry methods, the overarching goal is to systematically validate the efficiency of this new equipment, both in the laboratory and in the field.  We anticipate markedly better quantitative recovery of airborne microbial activity and genetic material (DNA) where directly compared to its filter-based counterparts.  Thus, the commercial and societal value of this new instrumentation is realized through displacing outmoded aerosol collection methods with highly efficient filter-less air sampling devices, outfitted with modern optics and digital automation.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to create a personalized, precision-based practice paradigm for surgery that improves surgical outcomes and reduces the cost of healthcare. This paradigm utilizes individual patient characteristics with machine-learning algorithms to accurately predict the risk of post-surgical complications. Additionally, it offers the possibility of enacting impactful interventions among high-risk patients, while reducing unnecessary therapies among low-risk patients, thereby improving surgical outcomes, maximizing the efficiency of healthcare, and minimizing cost. In a value-based care model, this paradigm aligns the goals of health systems, surgeons, and patients.

    The proposed project combines individual patient data with machine-learning algorithms to effectively predict surgical complication risk and improve surgical clinical outcomes. Currently, 13% of 50 million surgical procedures performed in the United States annually result in a surgical complication, half which are potentially avoidable. A primary cause of avoidable complications include significant variable in risk assessment and standardized preventative practice. Therefore, the principal objective of this proposal is to develop machine-learning predictive models of various surgical complications (wound, cardiac, respiratory, renal, etc.), which provides an objective risk assessment for surgeons. Additionally, this risk assessment platform will allow stratification of patients into high- vs. low-risk categories and link patients with risk-appropriate preventative interventions at the point-of-care.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will benefit nearly 6 million children per year who are suspected of having abnormal Gastroesophageal Reflux (GER) which can lead to a more serious condition with numerous complications referred to as Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD).  Current detection paradigms include costly and invasive procedures that often require overnight hospitalization, prescribing pharmacological Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) without objective evidence and or exposure to radiological imaging.  The outcomes of this project will lead to a low cost, non-invasive method for detecting GER, without requiring hospitalization.  This will facilitate earlier detection of GER and reduce overall healthcare costs and burdens associated with GERD and its accompanying complications.

    The proposed project will demonstrate the feasibility of using single point ultrasonic transducers to non-invasively detect and characterize reflux.  Current reflux detection relies on impedance and pH probes which are placed in the patient?s esophagus through a nasogastric probe.  This often requires anesthesia and overnight hospital observation which is costly, invasive, and prone to artifacts that change the reflux episodes normally experienced by the patient.  Ultrasonic imaging can observe reflux occurring in the esophagus but requires hundreds of ultrasonic transducers in a single probe and a trained clinician to manually observe and identify the reflux events.  These two factors make ultrasonic imaging costly to use and prevents it from being used for extended periods of time, which is necessary to determine if abnormal amounts of reflux are occurring.  The proposed project will use ultrasonic imaging as a control method to demonstrate the ability of single point ultrasonic transducers to generate an acoustic signature capable of detecting whether the esophagus is expanded or collapsed to identify episodes of reflux.  Detection and characterization of reflux through single point transducers would ultimately enable the development of a portable, safe, and accurate home monitoring device.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to standardize the process of securing and protecting umbilical cord catheters. These catheters are inserted into newborn babies in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and are used to provide life-saving nutrients and medication directly into their bloodstream. Unfortunately, the infection rate associated with these catheters is among the highest in the healthcare system. There is an important need for a simple medical device that reduces the risk of infection. A reduction in infection rate would save hospitals hundreds of thousands of dollars per year since they must currently absorb the cost of treating these infections. Most importantly, reducing umbilical catheter infection rates would save neonatal lives in any hospital setting.

    The proposed project will develop a standardized device that reliably secures umbilical cord catheters and protects the catheter insertion site from various sources of infection. The current standard of care for securing these catheters in NICUs across the United States is a roll of non-sterile tape that offers no protective barrier to the catheter insertion site. This is in stark contrast to medical devices that are used with adult catheters and help prevent bloodstream infections. The research objectives include evaluating different materials, testing the catheter securement mechanism, testing bacterial colonization rates, and evaluating the device?s biosafety for use on neonatal skin. This will be accomplished using custom-built testing rigs and protocols. We anticipate the successful development of a device with material specifications that allow for clinical testing in the NICU.

- abstractText: "This NSF SBIR Phase I project takes a unique holistic approach to
    both tumor imaging and cancer drug delivery.  This approach harnesses cancer cell
    proteins already in the body to allow selective delivery of tumor imaging agents
    or cancer-killing drugs to, and into, cancer cells.  By choosing cancer-specific
    targeting proteins, the drugs will be transported primarily into cancer cells
    and undesirable off-target enrichment will be diminished.  The goal is to mitigate
    drug uptake in non-cancerous fast-growing cells like; heart cells, bone marrow,
    skin or hair follicles.  Treated patients will benefit from improved effectiveness
    of their cancer therapies.  Such selective delivery should permit lower dosages
    of drug to be administered while also lowering the risks of unwanted, problematic
    side-effects. This cost-effective approach is well supported by the NSF?s core
    mission for the technical development of innovative drug delivery systems. \n\nIt
    remains challenging to provide sensitive tumor diagnosis and near-simultaneous
    assessments of response to cancer treatments in treated individuals.  Of all the
    standard monitoring modalities, radiographic examination has been the most widely
    used to measure treatment response.  However, some studies suggest up to 10-40%
    of cancers may not be measurable by currently available technologies.  Various
    delivery approaches have been used to take advantage of endogenous molecules to
    transport imaging agents or drugs with increased specificity into cancer cells.
    \ Most of these approaches utilize macromolecular ligands or cell surface receptor
    binding approaches.  This proposal takes a mechanistically innovative small-molecule
    approach.  By harnessing the activities of endogenous inflammatory proteins produced
    in abundance by cancer cells and by cells within the tumor micro-environment,
    small molecule cancer drugs can be transported with efficiency to the site of
    their intended effect.  Selective and accurate placement of a chemically-related
    diagnostic agent into cancer cells should allow a cost-effective, more personalized
    and exceedingly sensitive view of treatment response."

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology
    Transfer (STTR) project will be the development of a novel method for synthetic
    oligodeoxynucleotide purification. Currently, most oligodeoxynucleotides are purified
    using chromatography. The techniques are expensive or difficult to scale up, and
    unsuitable for parallel purification of multiple different samples. The proposed
    technology is easy to scale up for large-scale purification and suitable for parallel
    purification. Several areas that require synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides will
    benefit from the technology including oligodeoxynucleotide therapeutics and oligodeoxynucleotides
    used in genome assembly for synthetic biology applications. For therapeutic manufacturing,
    the proposed technology is expected to bring down the cost of production. For
    synthetic biology, the bottleneck is in the area is de novo construction of genomes,
    which requires large numbers of synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides. Parallel purification
    using the proposed technology will make these materials more affordable. In addition,
    the proposed technology can be readily extended to purify other biooligomers including
    peptides and oligosaccharides. This extension will have a high impact in areas
    such as biomedical research. \n\nThis STTR Phase I project proposes to method
    for synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide purification based on the \"catching by polymerization\"
    concept for the purification of synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides. Currently, most
    synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides are purified using chromatography methods, which
    rely on the rate of speed difference at which product and impurities travel in
    a solid matrix when eluted with solvents for separation. Drawbacks include expensive
    instrumentation, intensive labor, use of large volumes of harmful solvents and
    inability to purify long sequences. This method is expensive to scale up and unsuitable
    for parallel purification. This project aims to commercialize the catching full-length
    sequence by polymerization oligodeoxynucleotide purification technology to solve
    these problems. The method works by selectively tagging a polymerizable group
    to the oligodeoxynucleotide product, polymerizing it into an insoluble polymer,
    washing away all impurities and then cleaving the product from the polymer. Because
    the principle on which the product is separated from impurities is drastically
    different from that of chromatography methods, the proposed technique has many
    advantages, which include no need for expensive instrumentation, simple-to-use,
    low waste to product ratio, and suitability for purification of long sequences.
    Additionally, the new technique is readily scalable for large-scale purification,
    and can be easily adopted for parallel purification."

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology
    Transfer (STTR) project is to develop an engineered nonmodel yeast platform for
    the economical and sustainable production of natural aroma compounds. High quality
    aroma compounds have a variety of applications, ranging from flavor and fragrance
    to cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. With the strong consumer demand for more natural
    alternatives to chemically synthesized ingredients in both food and personal care
    items, the production of these ingredients by fermentation will add a renewable
    source to the supply chain and will reduce demand on botanical sources. This work
    will advance methodologies and knowledge for creating novel microbial cell factories
    via 13C-metabolite tracing, metabolic flux analysis, fermentation optimization,
    and kinetic modeling. The lessons from this research will offer general guidelines
    for overcoming biosynthesis hurdles and optimizing bioprocess operations, and
    will facilitate the development of transferable technologies for inexpensive production
    of diverse natural products that are broadly used for human health and wellness.
    \ \n \nThis STTR Phase I project proposes to integrate synthetic biology and bioprocess
    engineering to optimize the microbial strain for the de novo production of natural
    aroma compounds. Because plants carry aroma compounds in extremely low amounts,
    commercial extracts from plants are not economically viable. To overcome these
    challenges, this project will develop a novel fermentation process for production
    of these compounds with high product specificity and yields. Specifically, a nonmodel
    yeast strain will be engineered via PUSH (increase the supply of the precursor
    acetyl-CoA), PULL (overexpress key biosynthetic pathway genes), POWER (enhance
    ATP and NADPH generation) strategies. Further, 13C-metabolic flux analysis will
    be used to rigorously measure in vivo enzyme functions, to delineate acetyl-CoA
    supply/consumption pathways, and to identify metabolic burdens or bottleneck factors.
    Meanwhile, novel simultaneous fermentation and product recovery will be built
    to improve productivity. The fluxome information and fermentation kinetics will
    offer guidelines for rational genetic modifications and bioprocess optimizations.
    Ultimately, this environmentally friendly process would provide a new, reliable
    and natural manufacture scheme to meet the growing demand of consumers for healthier
    products."

- abstractText: "This STTR Phase I project aims to develop a novel microfluidic sensor
    technology that can measure blood coagulation times (specifically prothrombin
    time-PT, measured in international normalized ratio-INR) at point-of-care (POC).
    PT/INR has to be monitored frequently for millions of patients on oral Warfarin
    (an anticoagulant that prevents clotting) to keep them in a safe therapeutic range.
    The POC sensor developed in this project is expected to provide PT/INR measurements
    independent of factors influencing the blood counts of the patients, making it
    safer and more accurate. The technological foundation of the proposed research
    is to combine acoustic sensing with microfluidics. The preliminary data demonstrates
    that the proposed sensor can measure viscosity and density of extremely small
    liquid volumes (~ 10 nL) accurately. The successful implementation and commercialization
    of this innovation will result in a big market share in the rapidly growing POC
    coagulation test market and create hundreds of jobs. The research and development
    process during this STTR will also contribute to the full understanding of this
    technology?s potential, which can result in other self/home testing instruments
    for patients. \n\nThe proposed novel coagulation monitor is based on microfluidic
    quartz resonator sensors. Quartz resonator sensors can be used to measure changes
    in fluid viscosity or mass coupled to their surfaces (both of which occur during
    coagulation of blood) by monitoring the associated changes in the resonance frequency.
    The technology underlying quartz resonators is well established, simple and robust,
    and amenable to provide portable and compact instrumentation. The innovation here
    is the integrated microfluidics, which will bring the benefits of extremely low
    liquid volume requirements, control over how liquid is observed by the sensor
    (which can be used to enhance sensor output due to the coagulation), and on-chip
    blood plasma separation. The key objectives of the proposed research are to determine
    the microfluidics design and the surface functionalization that will optimize
    a microfluidic quartz resonator sensor?s coagulation measurement sensitivity,
    and to implement on-chip blood plasma separation for PT/INR measurements."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to provide a new class of biorational chemicals (based on chemical communicants from plant symbiotic fungi) that provide season-long improvements in plant productivity including enhanced root growth, resistance to a variety of stresses including drought, and increases in plant yield. This system will be developed for delivery as a seed treatment or as an augmented fertilizer. The novel products will be sold to famers through already-developed delivery systems primarily through agricultural distributors and seed companies. They are expected to increase plant root development, crop yields and tolerance/resistance to drought and other adverse conditions. The products can be used equally well by large and sophisticated farmers and seed companies, including those using advanced plant genetic traits, but is also adaptable to smaller growers since the input costs to users will be less than competitive technologies for especially coping with adverse environmental stresses. These tools and advances will assist is overcoming the adverse effects of climate change and provide technologies to maximize scarce water resources.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to formulate the active chemicals to provide user-friendly products for delivery in suitable agricultural systems including seed treatments and augmented fertilizers, and to evaluate prototype products on their advantages in the greenhouse, pilot scale and field trial systems. The field trials will be conducted under conditions of drought stress and will permit measurement of water use efficiency of conventional and advanced drought tolerant corn hybrids in the presence and absence of the new products, and will provide a means to determine the mechanism by which the active chemicals provide improvements in plant performance. This third goal is essential since the chemicals as applied are present only during seed germination, but enhance plant performance throughout the season. The formulations are based on novel systems that will sequester volatile active chemicals but release them only when seeds are germinating. The plant performance characteristics that will be measured include enhanced root development throughout the season, enhanced yield parameters under water limiting conditions, and measure water use efficiency.

    yield and quality, and by improving reliability. The technology developed under
    this program will be ready for beta-testing and initial sales. Further, it will
    provide a foundation for the development of a suite of services tailored to support
    the decision-making of the customer with respect to water management. On a societal
    level, this technology will help customers improve food security, manage water
    resources with respect to both consumption and pollution, minimize the impacts

    breakthrough: the ability to manipulate liquid water at negative pressure as plants
    do to form a sensor of drought stress. This biomimetic approach builds on a series
    of innovations in material science, microfabrication, and micro and nano-fluidic
    design by the investigators. This project will address outstanding design and

    transfer and uptake from soils in order to define best practice in the evaluation
    of water stress for irrigation management. Successful completion of these tasks
    will allow for commercialization of the sensor and build a foundation for continued

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to make the solar industry even more sustainable by reducting long term potential environmental impact. With the rapid deployment of solar modules, recycling of end-of-life modules will become a necessity in 15 years. The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) estimates that end-of-life modules will appear in large quantities by the early 2030's and by 2050 they will total 78 million tonnes. Today most end-of-life modules end up in landfills. More importantly, this project will develop a technology to enable a profitable recycling business without any government support, financial and/or legislative. IRENA predicts a new industry worth $15 billion by 2050 from recycling 78 million tonnes of modules. By recovering all the valuable components in modules, our technology has the potential to generate $60 billion in revenue from 78 million tonnes of modules.

    The proposed project develops sustainable recycling processes and related equipment for silicon solar cells and modules. The focus of the project is to recover all the valuable, toxic, and bulky components in cells and modules including solar-grade silicon, silver, lead, copper, tin, aluminum, and glass. It will be demonstrated that the recovered silicon meets the specifications of solar-grade silicon and the recovered metals are over 99% pure. The target for solar-grade silicon recovery is 85% and the target for metal recovery, especially silver, is over 90%. The chemicals for recycling will be carefully chosen so their wastes neutralize each other for a minimal environmental impact.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will investigate novel
    approaches for biopolymer materials that uniquely enable oxygen incorporation into hydrogel
    dressings to improve and accelerate chronic wound healing. The proposed work differs drastically
    from other research programs and commercial efforts to use oxygen in chronic wound healing as
    it is the first to combine oxygen, a moist and clean healing environment, and antimicrobial
    properties into one cost-effective and easy-to-use product. Current commercial oxygen-delivery
    therapies for wound care, e.g., hyperbaric oxygen chambers and topical oxygen devices, are
    intermittent, inconvenient to use, and require access to expensive specialized equipment.
    Successfully introducing oxygenating wound dressings to the market will allow addressing the
    serious and pervasive burden on healthcare facilities and the exorbitant costs associated with
    chronic wound care. In the USA alone, diabetic chronic wounds cause direct healthcare-related
    costs of $1.5 billion and total direct and indirect costs of $20 billion.
    The proposed research incorporates proprietary patent-pending biopolymer materials and
    processing methods to create oxygenating hydrogels that can be made into wound dressings.
    The dressings have the unique potential to provide uniform and tunable oxygenation to heal
    chronic wounds. Dressing embodiments, syntheses, and manufacturing techniques will be
    explored to improve product performance and characteristics, reduce costs, and demonstrate
    commercial feasibility and viability of the production process. Thus, knowledge of biomaterials for
    wound care will be significantly advanced by the proposed research. Prototype wound dressings
    will be characterized and tested based on customer requirements.

    This SBIR Phase I project aims to bring the industrial advanced manufacturing method of abrasive waterjet cutting to individual consumers by fully redesigning the core components of the machine to meet the budgetary needs of a consumer.  This project parallels the current movement of scaling down advance manufacturing techniques such as laser cutting and 3D printing to the growing desktop fabrication market.  Unfortunately, the desktop digital fabrication tools currently available to consumer market are restricted to producing goods in only soft materials like plastics, and wood.  The biggest advantage of abrasive waterjet cutting is its cutting ability in a wide range of materials including plastics, metals, stone, ceramics, glass, and composites.  With this technology finally accessible to a wider audience, everyone from the middle school robotocist, to a creative entrepreneur, to the makerspaces, to artisans, to small businesses will be able to digitally create physical designs in the full gambit of sheet materials that are currently available.


    Current commercial waterjet designs operate in a high pressure region that makes components prohibitively expensive for the consumer market.  To make the technology viable for the masses it must be adapted to a lower pressure space to leverage the necessary component cost savings across the machine.  This starts by creating a new performance model for low-pressure abrasive waterjet cutting through the design and execution of a test matrix that will determine how cutting performance is affected by various waterjet parameters (water pressure, water flow rate, abrasive flow rate, etc.).  With this understanding, the heart of the system, the hydraulic pump, will be adapted and customized from a pump construction that is not currently used for waterjet cutting. Lastly, this effort concludes with a ground-up redesign of the waterjet?s Cutting Head (the assembly that ejects the high velocity mixture of water and abrasive) utilizing low-cost materials, manufacturing processes and a unique geometry optimized for low-pressure cutting.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase 1 project includes: accelerating the pace of healthcare improvement by making information on high-need/high-cost patients instantly accessible and individually tailored to health care providers; transforming health intervention databases into active and dynamic learning communities about caring for high-need/high-cost patients; reducing the burden on safety net providers to sort and sift through dozens of information sources about delivering care to high-need/high-cost patients. Health Information Networking Tool (HINT) will be a unique combination of customized algorithms that will fill in critical gaps in knowledge, especially around health disparities, the social determinants of health and underserved conditions; boost opportunities for safety net providers to connect with peers to engage in collaborative problem-solving; reduce duplication and repetition of errors and failed interventions across safety net healthcare organizations; increase public recognition for safety net institutions that develop promising interventions; and enable technical advancements in machine learning to suggest models of care for high-need/high-cost patients. The commercial impact for HINT includes: reducing the cost and improving the quality of care delivered to high-need/high cost populations; and creating opportunities for safety net institutions and providers to market their expertise on caring for complex, underserved patients.

    The proposed project was conceived on the belief that ingenious solutions in caring for society's most vulnerable populations occur daily across the safety net health system; that HINT will accelerate innovation by bringing an unprecedented resource to disseminate voluminous and constantly changing healthcare information; that the proposed information network will reduce the fragmentation of information and duplication in errors and failed interventions that currently occur; and finally that unlocking and disseminating innovations and advice from peers - in similar institutions and caring for similar patients - will accelerate successful practices to improve the health of high-need/high-cost patients. HINT proposes to develop unique crawling, clustering, text mining, collaborative filtering, bipartite matching, and ranking algorithms. The team will integrate the six algorithms into a customized social content management system, and address challenges around design and functionality.

    This SBIR Phase 1 project aims to develop a novel continuous rotational spiral solidification technology platform called Heliolithography (HL) to enable economical mass production of functional end-use 3D printed parts. The potential outcome of this feasibility study would be improving speed and performance of the prototypes to demonstrate key advantages of the process. This highly beneficial platform aims to advance 3D printing technology into production of functional parts. Its success would contribute to widespread job creation in the U.S. Manufacturing sector.


    Heliolithography utilizes continuous rotation to overcome the inefficiencies of a serial layer to layer process typical of stereolithography machines (SLA) that must reset, re-position, re-supply material so the next layer can be made. The rotating method serves as a continuous method to cure material, removes the adhesion force issue that impedes many SLA processes from scaling up, and resupplies new material to be cured in one motion. If successful, this will serve as a significant leap forward in the field that will provide greater throughput for mass producing and mass customizing 3D prints while allowing for the use of a broader range of advanced materials with higher viscosities. The research project will also focus on the development of an advanced non-stick coating and a tiled, high power, high resolution light engine. A tethered liquid interface nano-coating will be evaluated by bond line release and wear rate/durability tests. The performance of the light engine will be validated through direct power output measurements and also through extended functional testing for dimensional accuracy, repeatability, and tensile & impact strengths of the printed parts.

    in nature.  One example is the human body's immune response where white blood
    cells search, sense, and react to disease-causing bacteria or viruses.  Artificial
    molecular or nanoscale systems with such autonomous capabilities are rare. Inspired
    by Nature, the NSF Center for Autonomous Chemistry (CAC) identifies the structural

    in the communication of science to non-experts and the engagement of diverse audiences.
    \ \n\nAutonomous regulation of molecular recognition with recognition-induced

    this challenge by identifying the bio-inspired structural factors and molecular
    design guidelines that allow for artificial molecular networks that are capable
    of autonomous operation. The NSF CAC brings together expertise in the design and
    synthesis of responsive supramolecular assemblies, characterization of assemblies
    in solution and in surfaces, and transduction of supramolecular events into readable

    Research Phase 1 project is the possibility of inexpensive clean water generation
    from sea and brackish water.  With rapidly increasing world population, portable
    water will be one of the most important technological challenges of this century.
    There is no unique ?one size fits all? approach to desalination. Many factors
    such as salt concentration, the presence of specific ions, energy cost, pretreatment
    requirements and capital investments are important considerations in selecting
    the desalination technology to be implemented. The carbon nanotube enhanced membrane
    distillation proposed here is a relatively low temperature process where industrial
    waste heat and solar heating can be used for desalination. Small water heaters
    such as the natural gas heaters used in homes can be used to generate high quality
    drinking water along with what is needed for domestic consumption. Another major
    application of this technology is in oil and gas drilling. Hydraulic fracturing
    or fracking is a water-intensive process. A typical frack well uses several million
    gallons of water over its lifetime and generates a highly saline ?produced water?.
    \  With its ability to handle high salt concentrations, the proposed approach
    is a viable alternative for treating this waste.  \n\nThe technical objectives
    in this project are to utilize carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to create breakthrough
    membrane properties for desalination via membrane distillation (MD). In MD, a
    hydrophobic porous membrane separates a hot salt water feed and a cold permeate
    stream.  As the heated brine passes on the membrane and is partially transformed
    to water vapor. The hydrophobicity of the membrane prevents the aqueous solution
    from entering the pores. However, freed from hydrogen bonding the water vapor
    passes through and is condensed on the permeate side of the membrane. The novel
    membranes referred to as carbon nanotube immobilized membranes (CNIM) will be
    developed by immobilizing CNTs into membrane pores where they will serve as molecular
    transporters and sorbents, thus providing additional pathways for water vapor
    transport. The other major advantage of CNIM is that it is less prone to fouling
    than conventional membranes. Key innovations of the proposal include the functionalization
    of CNTs for maximization of water vapor transport while minimizing fouling.  Additional
    objectives include the study of fouling behavior of some commercially important
    water samples such as sea water, power plant effluents and produced water. Finally,
    a process optimization tool will be developed to optimize CNIM-MD design."

    The NSF Center for Nanothread Chemistry pioneers a new form of carbon molecule, formed when arrays of small molecules transform under pressure into arrays of long thread-like molecules in a diamond-like geometry. These remarkable reactions totally reorganize every atom within the starting molecules to produce highly ordered parallel arrays of nanothreads. The team of researchers in the Center for Nanothread Chemistry aims to produce whole new families of nanothreads with diverse chemical compositions, structures, and properties. These materials can currently be made only in very small amounts, and a key goal of the Center is to learn how make larger quantities that will enable further fundamental science and technology impacts. This "flexible diamond" material may be broadly useful in application areas such as high strength composites, energy storage, and catalysis. These new nanomaterials also provide a rich venue for public outreach and the training of a diverse next generation of emerging science professionals.

    The NSF Center for Nanothread Chemistry defines the chemistry generating a new class of organic molecules defined by pervasive covalent bond connectivity in multiple dimensions.  Nanothreads, the first such example, are highly extended one-dimensional molecules with cage-like bonding, akin to the thinnest possible threads of diamond and capped by circumferential hydrogen. Nanothreads are synthesized by an innovative mechanochemical technique in which molecules with multiple unsaturated functions react under stress applied at carefully controlled rates. This strategy overcomes the traditional requirement for topochemical commensuration between the reactant and product and thus allows for many more molecular crystals to react into well-defined structures. The Center team is developing an actionable understanding of the reaction mechanism and enabling the design of new threads with desired arrangements of both interior heteroatoms and exterior functional groups. Post-synthesis modification allows for versatile incorporation of new groups of diverse function and also allows for additional structural elaboration. The unique architecture and properties of nanothreads provide opportunities for commercialization. The interplay of theory, synthesis and characterization provides rich training opportunities for diverse groups of students and researchers.

    Synthetic polymers and plastics make up a $100 billion industry and impact almost every aspect of daily life: from transportation to consumer products to health care.  These materials are made up of long, individual polymer molecules that are connected in a network that forms the bulk material.  In recent years, chemists have learned how to produce remarkable properties in the individual polymer molecules and control the connections between them.  The Center for the Chemistry of Molecularly Optimized Networks (MONET) is developing the knowledge and methods to translate the remarkable properties now available at the molecular level to new properties of polymer networks.  It fuels innovation in formulation and manufacturing, potentially leading to the development of tough, longer-lived materials that reduce waste while being perfectly tailored to their use.  The broader impacts of the Center include interdisciplinary technical training for young scientists across emerging areas of polymer chemistry, and communication and entrepreneurship experiences that position Center trainees for future careers. Finally, the Center partners with community colleges to increase public awareness of the societal impact of science innovation while simultaneously encouraging broader participation in the sciences by communicating the range of career opportunities available to the diverse community college population.

    The scope of MONET comprises quantitative structure-activity relationships that relate polymer network toughness to the toughness of individual network strands, the molecular architecture of the network, and the mechanism and spatial organization of dynamic strand exchange reactions. These objectives are pursued through a unique combination of methods, including precision polymer synthesis, single molecule spectroscopy, coordination chemistry, photochemical switching, and the development and application of new theoretical models and methods. In addition, a prototype database and digital notation for polymer entry (GIGA - the Global Index of Gel Attributes) is being established. The combined gains in fundamental knowledge, technical capability, and informatics strategy address a major chemical knowledge gap. MONET addresses the role of precisely controlled polymer chain length, the molecular mechanical response of a polymer chain, and the mechanisms by which polymer strands exchange in dynamic networks, as well as the influence of molecular scale network defects on each. The knowledge gained informs strategies to bring remarkable properties to polymer networks, by treating them as complex but understandable chemical systems that can be harnessed to produce currently inaccessible collective properties. Key broader impacts of this award include the development of a polymer network database, technical training and professional development for developing scientists, and science communication to diverse audiences.

    preparative electrochemical methods may become a natural choice to effect these
    syntheses due to their high product efficiency, mild conditions, and ease of scalability.

    of monomers is a current challenge in chemistry. Proteins are natural polymers,
    and are specific sequences of amino acids put together easily and efficiently
    by the living cell. The NSF Center for Genomically Encoded Materials (C-GEM) takes
    a bio-inspired approach making a sequence of synthetic polymers by re-engineering
    the cell's systems.  In this case, the cell becomes a new translational machine
    that synthesizes new chemical polymers of specific sequence and length. NSF C-GEM
    establishes a new, transformative field of chemistry and fosters innovation at
    the chemistry-biology-materials frontier. The applications of the new materials
    with novel properties range from information storage to anti-counterfeiting and
    drug delivery, from environmental remediation to drug discovery. NSF C-GEM engages
    scientists and non-scientists in a variety of research and educational activities,
    including improved communication to the public. These education and participation
    programs integrate research with training to establish a diverse chemical workforce.
    NSF C-GEM presents a new online platform and data management system, GEM-Net,
    to promote data sharing within and outside the research team. NSF C-GEM is also
    developing an online video game that allows citizen scientists to participate
    in the research process and track results. \n\nThe NSF Center for Genomically
    Encoded Materials, NSF C-GEM, is focused on the challenge of preparing polymers
    whose monomers and dispersity are defined with protein-like control. Sequence-defined
    polymers possess extraordinary potential for information storage, anti-counterfeiting,
    drug delivery, environmental remediation, and even drug discovery, but strategies
    to prepare them are barely in their infancy. NSF C-GEM's approach synthesizes
    sequence-defined chemical polymers by repurposing the E. coli translational apparatus.
    The translation machinery, which normally promotes bond formation between alpha-amino
    acids, now promotes bond-forming reactions between monomers that are the building
    blocks for aramids, polyolefins, polyurethanes, and other polymers. The approach
    demands orthogonal enzymes that acylate orthogonal tRNAs with each monomer, efficiently
    and in vivo; orthogonal ribosomes that accept these tRNAs as substrates and elongate
    the products; genomically-recoded organisms with multiple open codons to enable
    mRNA-templated synthesis of sequence-defined polymers; and high-resolution structural
    data to deepen understanding and inform design. The project develops the multi-disciplinary
    tools and technologies that demonstrate the proof of concept of the approach and
    establish practical methodologies to this aim. NSF C-GEM fosters innovation at
    the chemistry-biology-materials frontier, and engages scientists and non-scientists
    in research and educational activities. A diverse set of education and participation
    programs integrates research with training, establishes a diverse chemical workforce,

    and improved bio-medical imaging techniques. Broader impacts also result from
    the development of new theory tools, graduate student training at the interface

    This project entails the build out of the simulation engine for a touch-based, mobile game designed to intuitively teach the basics of electricity and magnetism to children aged 5+.  The mobile game gives users a picture of what?s happening inside a circuit, and allows them to play with the charges, electric and magnetic forces, voltage, capacitors, transistors, etc.  The use of funds from this NSF SBIR Grant would include the research and development required to build and incorporate this simulator into the game.  This simulator is novel, is customized for educational use, must be extraordinarily fast, and is based on Maxwell?s Equations, the four equations that govern all of electricity and magnetism.  The successful completion of this project will create a new way of teaching electricity and magnetism to children, giving them a visual understanding of the concepts.  The goal is to make science and engineering more attainable subjects to pursue in higher education.  This will lead to an increase in the number of science and engineering graduates in the US, and help to close the international educational achievement gap, which experts agree represents over a $1T overall opportunity loss.  Besides having a profound effect on the US economy, this also benefits the individual.  In 2014, the DOE reported that the median starting income of a STEM (engineering) graduate was $74,000, almost $25,000 more than a non-STEM graduate.

    The proposed real-time, interactive, multi-touch-based simulator would be the first of its kind; no combined two-dimensional field and circuit simulator exists today, particularly for use in an educational game.  This combined simulator only has 16 milliseconds to update its results, whereas a typical two-dimensional field solver could take minutes to hours to solve.  By using a novel simulator architecture and by focusing on speed and conceptual understanding at the necessary precision, the game simulator will be able to achieve the over 100x speed-up required.  The simulator needs to solve Maxwell?s equations and thus calculate and display the electromagnetic physics behavior at 60 frames per second, the rate required for interactive gaming. Several approaches are used to accomplish this.  This simulator is built from the ground up, with a unique choice of variables that prioritizes qualitative understanding over the circuit size and accuracy requirements of an industrial simulator.  The simulator focuses on components and circuits commonly used in teaching.  The simulator also utilizes the combined central/graphics processing hardware available in modern mobile devices.  With this simulator as the core gaming engine, the company is building a game where children as young as five can experiment with and intuitively understand the basics of electricity, magnetism, and circuits.

    to develop a faster and more accurate optical instrument for studying live cells
    and tissues. The study of live cells has yielded numerous discoveries (e.g. germ
    theory, the Krebs cycle, cell division) and is important for drug discovery and
    disease treatment. Live cells are transparent and need to be observed for long
    periods of time (days, weeks) in their natural state. To make the cells visible
    and measure them quantitatively, current state of the art instruments require
    injecting the cells with staining agents or light emitting fluorophores. Both
    processes are invasive, labor intensive and expensive and long term observations
    of live cells is difficult: staining embalms the cells and the fluorophores fade
    quickly and kill the cells in hours. The Phase I project produced a proof-of-concept
    prototype that provides quantitative imaging of live cells by processing the light
    transmitted through the cells in their natural state. Completion of the Phase
    II objectives will upgrade the Phase I prototype to a commercial grade instrument:
    improve optical design and build a housing enclosure, develop commercial grade
    software and automate the hardware controls and develop task-specific software
    applications to solve particular biological problems. \n\t\n\nThe broader impact/commercial
    potential of this project is to enable life scientists with a new and powerful
    instrument for studying live cells. The greatest impact of the commercial instrument
    developed in Phase II project will have is enabling researchers to do science
    better than before, i.e., more accurately, more quantitatively, and more noninvasively.
    The range of breakthroughs enabled by the instrument will likely include: novel
    drug discovery by accurate monitoring of cell response to treatment, fundamental
    studies of cell proliferation and growth, minimally invasive automatic diagnosis
    of cancer biopsies, and fast and accurate blood testing instruments. Scaling up
    the production of the instrument will create new jobs and increase the US dominance
    in the biotechnology area. Due to their full automation, the instruments can also
    operate in areas with limited access to trained personnel and provide the digital
    data necessary for remote diagnosis, such as Medically Underserved Areas/Populations
    in United States."

    to develop a handheld, one-step paper-based device for rapid self-testing of sexually
    transmitted infections. The company aims to replace lab-based assays for Chlamydia
    trachomatis (CT) and expand testing access to previously unreachable settings.
    The technology combines the ease-of-use and very low cost of rapid point-of-care
    (POC) diagnostics with the high accuracy of lab-based tests, enabling unprecedented
    reliability at the POC and at home. CT infection is one of the most prevalent
    STIs in the US. An estimated three million new cases occur each year with direct
    annual medical costs of greater than $3.5 billion. Untreated CT, symptomatic or
    not, may cause long term pregnancy complications, even infertility. Traditional
    lab-based CT assays prevent the ability to test-and-treat within one patient visit.
    This delay results in a high number of cases that do not get treatment due to
    loss-to-follow up (especially for young STI patients) and increased infection
    transmission. Phase Diagnostics? novel device will be: (1) Fast: Results to the
    patient in less than 15 minutes; (2) Affordable: Costs less than $1 to manufacture;
    (3) Accurate: Sensitivity and specificity on par with lab-based assays; (4) Convenient:
    Handheld with no required equipment or training. \n\nThe key innovation of the
    company's novel device is to use aqueous two-phase systems (ATPSs) to selectively
    pre-concentrate the pathogenic bacteria prior to detection, thereby dramatically
    enhancing the accuracy of conventional rapid LFA POC technology and enabling the
    use of urine samples for the detection of CT. During Phase I, the company was
    able to adapt ATPS to urine medium, attain improved limits of detection of its
    system and make considerable progress in fully integrating all components into
    a true one-step paper microfluidic strip. The objective of Phase II is to fully
    develop the company's proposed device to be ready for FDA 510(k) clearance and
    CLIA waiver enabling clinical studies. The company will first complete the product
    optimization work initiated in Phase I and perform additional device robustness
    studies. As these experiments near completion, the company will work with a contract
    prototyper to design and develop prototypes based on the final optimized device
    components. At the same time, the company will establish small scale manufacturing
    processes to ensure that it can generate a reproducible pilot batch. The company
    will then perform Alpha and Beta product testing to determine the clinical performance
    of its prototype as well as obtain feedback from end-users to determine areas
    for optimization."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project will be the discovery of new ionization technology for use with mass spectrometry.  This technology will enable lower cost, lower energy use, and reduced user expertise, which may potentially drive mass spectrometry into large and underserved markets such as medical diagnostics and field portable instruments designed specifically for use in homeland security, bedside diagnostics, or bio-threat detection. The new technology changes the current understanding of ionization processes used in mass spectrometry and provides opportunities for new innovations to advance science through improved measurements, impacting fields such as health, safety, and security. The aims of this Phase II project are to develop interfaces to incorporate the platform developed in Phase I on most major mass spectrometer manufacturer's instruments and to develop technologies for rapid automate analyses even of surfaces.  The research of Phase II is aimed to better understand the fundamentals of this new technology in order to drive commercial success in high sensitivity rapid analyses at a competitive price. Mass spectrometers are widely used representing a $4 billion industry of which ionization technology represents a significant commercial opportunity.

    This STTR Phase II project proposes to revolutionize ionization in mass spectrometry by providing commercial products that utilize a simple and powerful ionization technology. The newly discovered process spontaneously converts large and small, volatile and nonvolatile compounds to the gas-phase ions necessary for analysis using mass spectrometry without employing currently used high cost lasers or high voltage. The method is broadly applicable for analysis of compounds such as drugs, lipids, carbohydrate conjugates, peptides, and proteins directly from bodily fluids or tissue, as well as synthetic polymers and inorganic catalytic surfaces.  This technology is anticipated to augment or even replace older ionization methods in applications such as clinical analyses, pharmaceuticals, forensics, environmental, and food safety. The aims of the Phase II project are to implement the multifunctional platform developed during Phase I on a variety of manufacturer's instruments, automate the process to allow lower cost and faster analyses, and provide an automated surface analysis platform.  Besides determining the best sample preparation methodologies and choice of solvents/matrices, the research objectives include innovative automated sample introduction technologies that eliminate the need for a conventional "ion source" while reducing the pumping requirements, which currently hinder development of small, low-cost portable mass spectrometers.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project evaluates the feasibility of constructing vivid, full-color, reflective display modules for large-area outdoor digital signage driven by dielectric elastomers suitable for pilot testing.  Completion of Phase II objectives is expected to have the following impact:  Commercially, the availability of new signage products will create significant economic impact through partial capture of the $14.2B domestic billboard and sign manufacturing market.  Up to 10% of US zoning codes are estimated to prohibit LED-based (light emitting diode) signage while potentially permitting a reflective digital signage technology, expanding the domestic market up to $5.6B, with a 10x impact worldwide.  Environmentally, greenhouse gas reduction is expected as an alternative to LED-based technology; up to 40x reduction in energy consumption is anticipated relative to LEDs. Additionally, billboard wrap waste will be reduced by replacing printed signage. Scientifically, the use of dielectric elastomers as a class of materials in products would be promoted through addressing technological and manufacturing hurdles currently limiting market translation. Societally, increased impact from timely public service announcements on digital billboards displayed during natural disasters, when catching fugitives from the FBI?s Most Wanted lists, and with Amber/Silver alerts are expected through large-area digital sign proliferation.

    In phase II, electroactive polymer-based proof-of-concept display modules will be constructed and tested, ready for pilot testing with initial customers.  The low-cost display design uses unique electro-hydraulic driving principles to enable exceptional refractive index matching within the optical stack for highly vivid and reflective full-color generation.  In phase I, a functional proof-of-concept pixel array module was fabricated using scalable processes.  To achieve pilot readiness, improvements in performance, resolution, and calibration to meet advertiser standards are needed, as well as environmental qualification for outdoor operation, development of industry-conscious software control, and qualification of supply chain inputs to enable further production at scale.  Phase II research will address these technical challenges by introducing process refinements and quality control standards, conduct color calibration using existing techniques, perform industry-relevant environmental testing, work with vendors to source soft-tooled components, and develop module and multi-module control software.  The result of phase II efforts will be a calibrated and rugged one square foot, full-color, 16mm pitch, reflective display module ready for scaling to pilot production following phase II.

    develop a technology to transform swine manure into sustainable alternatives for
    petroleum-based adhesives, with a first opportunity in the asphalt market.  This
    project builds on a successful Phase I effort as well as a prior Innovation Corps
    award. The major socio-economic impact of the technology will be in rural areas,
    as it will allow pig farmers to alleviate the burden of manure management and
    create a new revenue stream.  This project also offers a novel approach to develop
    low-cost, durable, and eco-friendly construction adhesives, reduce the cost associated
    with manure management and lagoon maintenance, create new manufacturing and engineering
    jobs, and reduce our dependence on petroleum resources. Current practices for
    handling manure release carbon to the atmosphere, either from manure storage or
    anaerobic digestion of manure. In contrast, the proposed technology sequesters
    carbon in bio-adhesives, while passing nutrients to the effluents, bio-char, and
    grey water, which can then be used as fertilizer.  The Phase I research results
    have shown that bio-adhesive is more durable, lower in cost ($0.50/gallon, as
    compared with $2.00/gallon) and more eco-friendly (lower volatile organic compound
    levels) than many petroleum-based adhesives.\n \nThe core technology to be developed
    further in this effort uses thermochemical liquefaction to convert swine manure
    to bio-oil, followed by the polymerization of bio-oil to produce bio-adhesives.
    This technology will eventually enable use of the six billion gallons of swine
    manure that are generated annually in the U.S. to supply about 88 million barrels
    of bio-adhesive.  As a result of the Phase I effort, a study of the effects of
    heating rate on the yield and quality of bio-adhesive was completed; this in turn,
    helped ensure that the conversion process takes place successfully, thereby addressing
    one of the main scale-up challenges. The resulting data were used as an input
    for the design of a pilot bio-reactor, including central heaters and a heat exchanger.
    \ After the design phase, the team began the fabrication and assembly of this
    bio-reactor, and followed up with multiple trials.  In the Phase II project, building
    on these successful trials, we will complete the troubleshooting of the bio-reactor
    while finalizing the design and construction of the oil separation and polymerization
    column, and sampling valves.  These items will permit a fully-realized pilot plant
    by the end of this project."

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project presents novel technology to fabricate dry, removable, reusable adhesives based on aligned polymeric nanofibers using scalable electrospinning methodologies.  This new approach offers the potential advantages of significantly lower costs and easier scale-up using nozzle-free nanofiber spinning processes. Dry reusable adhesives as a replacement for messy liquid glues will improve product safety and reduce environmental impact. Removable and reusable adhesive tapes and labels will also eliminate waste and facilitate product recycling. The resulting products will have strong shear adhesion and easy peel, leading to broad application with a wide range of substrates like glass, metal, wall board, and plastics. Proof-of-concept samples have confirmed market-driven value propositions. The Phase II project will develop commercial products and applications for consumer and industrial applications, for automotive assembly systems, for decorative wall murals, and for medical device and health care uses. Fiber spinning and collection techniques will be engineered to improve product performance, reduce costs and improve scalability of the manufacturing process.

    The Phase I project has confirmed proof-of-concept dry adhesive samples with shear adhesion strengths exceeding 20 N/cm2 in dynamic mode and 45 N/cm2 in dead weight mode.  The resulting samples have low peel strength and are reusable. In Phase II, the electrospinning process will be optimized using novel polymer blend systems to achieve performance targets for specific customer product development. The nozzleless electrospinning process will be scaled to the pilot level for product testing and to provide the engineering design basis for commercial manufacture. A continuous roll-to-roll process to produce aligned nanofibers will break new ground in the electrospinning industry.  New applications in medical devices have been proposed by strategic partners to capitalize on the self-adhesion properties of these materials.  Dry adhesive applicator systems will be developed to allow the aligned adhesive nanofibers to conform to surface asperities. With the Phase I success of proof-of-concept prototypes, the Phase II effort will move the development of aligned nanofiber dry adhesives into the market introduction phase in preparation for commercial manufacture and sales.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project extends to industry stakeholders holding financial
    interests that are impacted by climate change. Climate change has a scientifically
    evident impact on the intensity, duration, and frequency of extreme weather events.
    It has become imperative for organizations in all sectors to gain a clear understanding
    of the impacts of climate change on their business so as to inform strategic planning
    and risk management strategies. Those in the risk transfer industry, in particular
    reinsurance companies, are the most likely early adopters given their technical
    sophistication and their increasing and acute awareness of the financial impacts
    climate change now has on their bottom line. Thus, the company's goal is to penetrate
    the reinsurance industry as an entry point to the more broadly defined risk transfer
    industry. Subsequently, the company will utilize the platform to address problems
    in agricultural investment, real estate investment, and energy planning - all
    sectors that will be adversely impacted by climate change in specific, well-defined
    ways. The adaptation in each of these sectors is vital to the well-being and prosperity
    of the ultimate stakeholder: the American taxpayer. \n\nThis Small Business Innovation
    Research Phase II project aims to harness industry knowledge and expand on the
    technical work conducted during the company's Phase I project, with the objective
    of building a modular software platform generalizable to multiple key climate
    change hazards and extensible to other strategically identified sectors. The knowledge
    gathered via customer discovery interviews in Phase I will serve as a guide for
    product development. The technical work completed in Phase I, in particular extreme
    precipitation modeling under climate change and its application to the risk transfer
    sector, will serve as a foundation for expansion into the modeling of additional
    hazards. There are currently no tools available that integrate climate change
    informatics into risk management at scale. The company aims to address this problem
    through the translation of physics-guided statistical modeling to a commercial
    software platform. Upon conclusion of the Phase II project, the company expects
    to have a completed product that will house data on additional hazards exacerbated
    by climate change, with applications in the agriculture, commercial real estate,
    and the energy sectors. The company will show product value through sector-tailored
    software demonstrations and case studies that demonstrate return on investment
    to be realized by using this platform.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory
    mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
    intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will advance a novel probe-based direct transfer (PBDT) printing technology for manufacturing flexible hybrid electronic (FHE) devices. PBDT promises to deliver unprecedented selective, high-fidelity component transfer of a broad range of low-dimensional, high-performance electronic components with diverse architectures and sizes to flexible substrates. The technology will accelerate manufacturing capability to meet a critical need in the flexible and printed electronics market. The development of a stand-alone, automatic PBDT tool will provide flexible electronics developers and manufacturers an unparalleled solution for integrating high-performance thin and ultra-thin electronic materials into next-generation flexible devices. The impact on the market and on daily life has the potential to be transformative, with everything from consumer devices (e.g., flexible phones and tablets), to imaging and sensing, to health care and homeland security being improved by advancements in flexible device manufacturing. Furthermore, PBDT will enable new directions in flexible device research and product development. 

     The overall objective of the Phase II project is to produce a prototype of a commercial version of a PBDT tool. In addition, detailed performance specs of the process and tool will be established, and functional FHE devices will be assembled using automated PBDT printing. The Phase I feasibility study demonstrated that the PBDT approach of handling a flexible substrate as both a stamp and as the destination substrate allows for defect-free transfer of semiconductor components that are an order of magnitude thinner and more complex laterally than what conventional tools can handle. Based on the Phase I accomplishments, Phase II funding will be used to develop and demonstrate a prototype tool that will serve as the template for a fully automated commercial product. Successful commercialization of PBDT will require advances in PBDT processes and hardware; therefore, the specific objectives of the Phase II project are focused on (i) characterizing the full process space of PBDT technology, (ii) demonstrating a complete process flow for assembling and metalizing functional FHE devices, and (iii) validating the prototype in terms of printing rate and fidelity. The collaborating university partner will contribute to the design and fabrication of thin and ultra-thin silicon components to assess the performance of the tool and demonstrate viable FHE sensors.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project results from the advancement of a novel water treatment process that reduces membrane fouling and significantly lowers water treatment costs. Membrane filtration is one of the primary water treatment technologies to address the global challenge of water scarcity. However, the membrane industry suffers from low productivity and high operational cost caused by fouling. Over 95% of the water treatment plants in US that employ membrane filtration currently operate at only 30-50% of their design capacity. Our revolutionary pretreatment technology not only mitigates fouling, but also increases system productivity by up to 400% and decreases the required membrane cleaning frequency by a factor of 50, thereby saving water, money and energy. The process can reduce both the capital expense and annual operational cost of water treatment plants by roughly 25%. Our innovation is also applicable to saline water, so it can be used as a pretreatment for desalination, and it can address another major environmental challenge by removing phosphorus from wastewater and thereby reducing the prevalence of blooms of toxic algae.

    This SBIR Phase II project will continue our scale-up and commercialization activities for our pretreatment technology to improve the performance of membranes in water treatment processes with respect to contaminant removal, process productivity, and energy efficiency, compared to existing technologies. The process relies on application of a proprietary particle in a novel reactor and has been demonstrated in our Phase I work. The objectives of the Phase II work are (1) scale-up and construction of larger treatment modules using commercially suitable materials and fabrication processes; (2) testing under more aggressive operational conditions; (3) improving particle production, delivery, and disposal processes; and (4) evaluating the particles' suitability as an economic approach to remove and recover phosphorus from wastewater. The economic analysis will also be updated using data collected in Phase II study. The effort will advance the technical readiness level (TRL) of our process to TRL6, while providing essential data for further development and credibility for marketing. On completion of Phase II, we expect to be prepared for deployment in small-scale commercial systems treating one million gallons per day, and for testing in larger systems.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project comes from addressing the thermal challenges brought about by the significant increase in transistor density that semiconductors have experienced over the past few decades. This trend has enabled many advancements ranging from high performance servers to Internet of Things devices. Still, with every advance in chip technology, the difficulty of chip cooling continues to increase. Three major thermal interface material (TIM) market segments exist: polymer composites, metallic materials and phase-change materials. Commercial carbon nanotubes (CNTs) will create a fourth market segment that will supplant existing TIMs, initially in the chip testing market and eventually extending into servers, high performance computing and Internet of Things devices. CNT researchers and small businesses have made little progress towards a commercial TIM product. Among other factors, this failure is driven by poor positioning in the crowded low-cost TIM space, which is currently dominated by thermal greases and pads. Progress towards a viable solution lies in the strategic alignment of product features with industry pain points. This Phase II SBIR aims to develop a means to scale the ability to produce CNT based TIMs as well as to further improve their performance.

    The technical objectives of this SBIR Phase II project are to: 1) scale up of the CNT TIM manufacturing process to achieve a production capacity of 200,000 sq. in of product annually and to 2) enhance the conductivity of the CNT array by a factor of 3x or more to facilitate entry into the TIM1 and TIM2 market. This project will ultimately develop processes that will translate into achieving production scale CNT based thermal interface materials for the first time in the world. Scale up will be achieved through a combination of physical vapor deposition and chemical vapor deposition processes developed on tools designed specifically for CNT production. In Phase I of this research effort, two commercial products aimed at the semiconductor chip testing market were developed and validated through collaboration with leading chip manufacturers. In addition to the chip testing market segment, in Phase II products will be developed for entry into the TIM1 and Internet of Things markets.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this SBIR Phase II project will be the enhanced ability to monitor NOx optically using a unique approach that is fundamentally different from voltage biased solid electrolyte diffusion technology deployed commercially today. NSF Phase I activities brought to light the shortcomings of existing sensor technology, including slow response time and up to 90% "garbage data" that OEMs and regulatory authorities have to work around. Phase II efforts include improvement of Phase I prototypes where near instantaneous NOx detection to ~200 ppm was observed. NOx are a major pollutant and precursor to acid rain, surface ozone and smog formation. Worldwide regulatory bodies are driving NOx regulations to increasingly stringent levels, thus presenting even greater challenges for real-world emissions. Addressing these regulations, industry must deploy after-treatment technologies including selective catalyst reduction systems and lean NOx traps. Both of these technologies will benefit from a less expensive, more robust, and faster responding NOx sensor. With continued success, the new NOx sensor has the potential to significantly reduce emissions levels through a more accurate and much faster detection than current NOx detection techniques thus allowing the internal combustion engine to directly employ detection feedback to enhance emission controls.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will continue the prototyping and characterization of an optical based Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) sensor technology not based on oxygen sensor derivatives found in the market today. We will further optimize the design and materials needed for a novel thermo-catalytic NOx sensing mechanism through continued experimentation and testing. Increasing the number and type of catalytic sensing elements and integrating them into existing OEM packaging will allow us to measure NOx as well as other gases including ammonia (NH3). Sensor calibration equations and response lookup-tables will help validate our new method for NOx detection with successful results creating the foundation of a new category of sensors based on this differential detection architecture. Current automotive NOx sensors do not meet response time, accuracy and price requirements as used in the industry where such parameters are critical. The Phase II will optimize the optical sensing mechanism, and planned designs of experiment will help refine this technology into a reliable and robust device. Besides NOx and NH3, our "inorganic taste buds" also derive carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbon concentration as a byproduct of the measurement process, thus providing additional utility for any combustion emissions control application.

- abstractText: "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will
    address the design, prototype and testing of a modular tension control device
    for individual tension regulation in the composite manufacturing sector. Composites
    are increasingly used in mission critical applications where the material and
    the product must perform reliably, while at the same time improving productivity,
    increasing product quality and lowering cost. By precisely and consistently controlling
    tension, there are fewer voids, skips or uneven tows, resulting in a higher quality
    product. This is particularly important when safety is dependent on the structural
    integrity of the materials. Overall, composite applications are greener and have
    a positive environmental impact. Comparably priced but safer automobiles from
    composites will be lighter and consume less fuel. Composites further reduce reliance
    on fossil fuels, as they are the building blocks to harness renewable energy.
    Wind blades, solar panels and underwater turbines are all made from composites.
    This is a rapidly growing multi-billion-dollar market, and the projected share
    of the targeted tension control market is in the range of $200 million, growing
    equally fast, if not faster. \n\nThis project will solve a problem that has plagued
    the composites industry since its inception. Tension control is especially difficult
    (and yet very important in the composites industry), as multiple materials with
    different tear strengths and varying elasticity are combined to make stronger
    products. Lack of cost effective tension control has, up to this point, limited
    the speed and quality of finished products. Phase II objectives are to prototype
    and develop the manufacturing process for the Modular Tensioning Cartridge. The
    Phase II Objectives are: 1) Control package design - the goal is to create a central
    base station to provide power, communications and a central interface for the
    use of multiple Modular Tensioning Cartridge units; 2) Finalization - all successfully
    tested components must be assembled into a singular industrial grade prototype
    unit and then tested; 3) Product release - upon final prototype testing, field
    trials will be conducted to validate and finalize technology leading to full production.
    In phase I, feasibility of the individual components to meet performance requirements
    was successfully demonstrated. In Phase II, prototype units will be developed
    and tested refining the design to meet the performance expectations of the customers.\n\nThis
    award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
    evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
    criteria."

    This SBIR Phase II project will fully develop and market a digital language tool previously found effective in helping non-native English speakers acquire language skills. It was found in SBIR Phase I that students using the tool improved their test scores both absolutely and relative to their peers. Spanish-speaking students learned more effectively when given native-language educational tools in multiple subjects. Competing educational tools are not designed to help those who are natively fluent in Spanish transfer their skills to a new language. Consequently, more than 40% of non-native speakers drop out. If successful, this project will bring to a wider market an existing educational product (created by a small, minority-owned business and already in use nationwide), and improve the educational opportunities for hundreds of thousands of non-native English-speaking students in both language arts and the scientific disciplines core to the National Science Foundation?s mission. Moreover, because schools face significant financial pressure to improve student achievement and because the product is competitively priced, it will be shown to be commercially viable, and a plan will be developed to expand the market for the tool outside of the state of California where it was initially studied.


    An expanding body of research has shown that language learners perform better on standardized tests when they can transfer their ability in another language (Spanish) to the acquisition of English. However, existing tools have not yet met this market need and focus instead on English-only instruction optimized for students who already speak natively. This project proposes to fully develop and market an existing language-acquisition platform found to be effective during pilot research in a large California school. SBIR Phase II research will address outstanding hypotheses suggested by Phase I results, and determine whether the tool can be easily adopted by stakeholders. Specifically, the impact of assignments chosen by teachers will be disambiguated from the use of the tool more generally, and the impact of English-only versus bilingual scaffolding will be studied in more detail to tailor the product to individual use cases. During Phase II, the product will also be integrated with existing academic systems and analytical software, and competitive per-seat pricing will be developed such that it can be marketed first within California and then nationwide by a network of resellers. A successful product will be measured by its effectiveness in closing the gap between native and non-native English speakers, at scale.

    Research (SBIR) project will be to develop a platform technology for detecting
    autoantibody markers for research and clinical diagnostics. Precision medicine
    requires the development of more powerful bioanalytic technologies to diagnose
    disease and direct targeted therapies. This platform uses a ligation-based DNA
    barcoding technology for improved antibody detection with increased analytical
    sensitivity and multiplex power to detect more at the most clinically useful time.
    Additionally, as a solution-phase assay, it is able to detect numerous clinically-relevant
    autoantibodies that are refractory to common techniques like ELISA.  This platform
    has the potential to accelerate the development of lifesaving diagnostics across
    a broad spectrum of human diseases. \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research
    Phase II project aims to develop the first solution-phase, ultrasensitive and
    multiplex antibody assay platform for the early detection, monitoring and treatment
    of human diseases. The Antibody Detection by Agglutination-PCR (ADAP) platform
    represents a major advancement in multiplex immunoassay testing. Many current
    multiplex technologies, such as microarrays and bead-based arrays, scale poorly
    due to cross-analyte interference, and lack the analytical sensitivity to detect
    crippling diseases at the most favorable time.  The Phase I results showed the
    expanded and validated ADAP technology for the ultrasensitive and multiplex detection
    of antibody biomarkers. The Phase II objectives are: 1) Validation of the multiplex
    ADAP assay for clinical diagnostics serving autoimmune connective tissue diseases,
    thyroid disorders and celiac diseases; 2) High-throughput automation of multiplex
    ADAP assay technology for clinical diagnostics; 3) Manufacturing of assay reagents
    and establishment of quality control standards; and 4) Demonstration of the applicability
    of multiplex ADAP for a broader set of antibodies. The intellectual merit of this
    project resides in the achievement of 10,000x increased sensitivity, and 20-30%
    increased specificity at multiplex while having the option to use existing PCR

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be in promoting clean energy technologies. More than half of the United States? greenhouse gas emissions come from transportation and electricity production. Lithium-ion batteries are a promising technology to facilitate the adoption of electric vehicles and renewable power generation that drastically reduce greenhouse gas emission. However, the high cost of lithium-ion batteries threatens the commercial viability of clean technologies. This Phase II project will develop manufacturing process technologies that reduce the capital and operating costs of the most expensive step in lithium-ion battery manufacturing. Low-cost batteries will push electric vehicles towards widespread commercial adoption. Electrification of mass-transit buses will improve urban air quality, especially for the low-income population located near bus depots. Large-scale battery systems enabled by low-cost batteries will turn renewable power generation such as solar and wind from periodic energy sources into on-demand energy sources to alleviate our dependence on fossil-fuels. This Phase II project will help lithium-ion batteries become a key technology in the successful departure from oil dependence, combat of climate change, and the United States? energy security.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project addresses the need for deeper understanding of the fundamental science behind the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer. SEI layer quality is a key determinant of long-term battery reliability, performance, and safety, but the underlying electrochemistry that governs SEI composition and evolution remains poorly understood. This Phase II project will develop novel, in-situ diagnostics to directly measure the evolution, performance, and characteristics of the SEI layer as it is formed during lithium-ion battery manufacturing. Deeper insight into the complex morphology of the SEI layer will advance much-needed industry knowledge of battery performance, quality, and longevity. Additionally, there is a sizeable body of work in modeling the degradation of batteries throughout their lifecycle. With improved cell-level traceability, the manufacturing insights enabled by this Phase II project will expand the current understanding of the ?ideal battery? at the beginning of life and complement ongoing work on how batteries degrade over time. This insight opens the door for quality control in battery manufacturing based on more direct quality metrics such as longevity and reliability rather than indirect metrics such as beginning of life capacity.

    This SBIR Phase II project aims to facilitate understanding of cellular diversity in tumors, a phenomenon that contributes to acquired drug resistance. Quantifying and understanding this diversity may help predict a patient?s response to certain drugs which would allow the selection of ideal drug combinations for an individual patient?s tumor, thus enabling personalized medicine. This Phase II project will provide drug developers and researchers with a tool that can quantify diversity by correlating genetic and spatial information from tumors, providing crucial information about tumor composition that is currently missing today. This project will translate the technology into an efficient, high-throughput workflow that will enable commercialization with drug developers, researchers, and reference laboratories, generating both income and multiple job opportunities. The commercialization of this innovation will significantly impact scientific, corporate, and patient communities. Researchers will have a new tool improving drug development for cancer and other diseases, including Alzheimer?s and diabetes. Payers, such as insurance companies and the government, will save costs by eliminating unnecessary spending on treatments for patients who will not respond. Most importantly, patients will have broader access to personalized medicine through new treatments and screening methods that can help determine the optimum drug combinations for them.

    A single tumor contains multiple populations of cells that each have unique mutations, and it is necessary to understand the location and genetic differences of these cells in order to provide effective combination therapies that will not result in overall treatment failure or relapse. This Phase II project aims to provide drug developers, researchers, and physicians with a tool to correlate genetic and spatial information about individual tumors. Using a proprietary microfluidic device adhered to a standard microscope slide and tissue biopsy, incorporated with a laser-coupled microscope, this tool is capable of providing information that it is not possible to obtain from any other method today. Building upon the feasibility established during the Phase I project, Phase II will involve performing NGS to demonstrate the instrument?s usefulness in providing data for clinical research and biomarker discovery. It will also involve building a fully integrated prototype instrument with features that increase automation and throughput to make the technology economically feasible for commercialization. These developments will showcase the instrument?s value to customers as well as enable the commercial launch of a service.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will be the development and demonstration of a new manufacturing technology for lightweight bio-based plastics.  Plastic produced from plant materials can have lower environmental impact than petroleum-based plastics, but price and performance issues have limited their adoption. In Phase I, Grow Plastics demonstrated the ability to produce lightweight, low cost, thermally stable 100% bio-based packaging products.  In Phase II, Grow Plastics will continue the development of its products while also working to develop a full-scale manufacturing line. The goal of the technology is to replace billions of pounds of petroleum-based plastic with a lower density plastic requiring half as much material, which is made from plants.

    This SBIR Phase II research project proposes to continue the development of a new manufacturing process for layered structures in biomaterials.  Grow Plastics has demonstrated the ability to generate novel, high-performance layered cellular structures in biopolymers in a new manufacturing process using new machinery.  The challenge in Phase II will be to continue the development in materials from Phase I while also scaling the technology to industrial scale.  Materials science and manufacturing techniques will include polymer blending, solid state foaming, and thermal crystallization of polymer blends. Analysis techniques will include tensile testing, differential scanning calorimetry, thermo mechanical analysis, and evaluation of final product properties.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to provide a sustainable, low-cost, and replicable
    method for large-scale production of micro-algal biomass. Microalgae production
    is a form of aquaculture capable of producing valuable products including:  Nutraceuticals,
    specialty chemicals, pharmaceuticals, feed for finfish, shellfish, and livestock,
    as well as food for human consumption.  Moreover, microalgae can be used as a
    feedstock for biofuels while simultaneously removing CO2 from the environment.
    \  However, for the nascent algae cultivation industry to achieve its full commercial
    potential, the technology must be improved.  While typical algal cultivation relies
    on high-density cell growth, this project will focus on the science of low-density
    algal cultivation to achieve high productivity, while minimizing process requirements
    for supplemental energy and concentrated CO2.  In addition, the development of
    a closed-system photo-bioreactor with emphasis on low cost and modular design
    will allow the process to be easily replicated on a variety of lands with otherwise
    marginal value. As such, the system can become the basis for a robust aquaculture

    and a source of sustainable products for the growing world population. \n\nThis
    SBIR Phase II project proposes to further optimize the design of the large-scale
    algal production system developed during the Phase I project to address key challenges
    in algae cultivation including frequent contamination, low productivity, and increased
    operating costs due to inefficient use of water and energy. Research activities
    will focus on four main objectives: 1) Finalize key design specifications for
    reactor geometry, materials of construction, and system components in order to
    maximize productivity and minimize capital costs; 2) optimize harvest apparatus
    design and biomass concentration procedure to further reduce water consumption;
    3) develop a new media formulation to allow for stable pH control without the
    need for concentrated CO2; and 4) refine manufacturing of the reactor bladder
    to ensure sterility, durability, and product consistency.  In addition to the
    basic algae cultivation techniques employed in Phase I, Phase II will make greater
    use of engineering /computational analyses to arrive at optimal designs.  The
    target outcome of the project is a 120,000-L closed photo-bioreactor capable of
    sustaining H. pluvialis algae production rates of greater than 9 g/m2/d for a

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to de-risk the volume manufacturability and reliability of thin crystalline power MOSFETs fabricated with a novel exfoliation technology demonstrated in Phase 1.  The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to enable lower cost and better performance for power devices in switching or transferring electricity under varying power requirements across the voltage spectrum in a variety of applications ranging from consumer, to communications, automotive and industrial applications.  In all of these applications, the ON resistance of the power MOSFET and IGBTs can be reduced and the switching speed and performance further improved by reducing the device thickness.  Additionally, in consumer and mobile applications, reducing the form factor of the power MOSFET devices can enable slimmer and lighter products.  A significant broader impact of this technology will be the reduction of expensive and environmentally hazardous waste treatment processes associated with wafer grinding technology used in the power MOSFET industry.  While the power MOSFETs developed using this technology can have broad commercial and societal impact, the use of this thin crystalline technology can have even broader impact across all modern semiconductor devices such as LED, PV, flexible CMOS and passive devices.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses challenges to further scaling of Power MOSFETs which are one of the key building blocks of the electronic revolution over the last few decades. While the feature size of transistors has been constantly shrinking, the substrate thickness has been increasing. These substrates are currently mechanically thinned to minimize the negative impact of this increased thickness on performance and form-factor. There are significant challenges to continue this trend and the thin crystalline technology and device architecture proposed here can enable continued scaling of device metrics over the next decade with favorable cost structures.  During phase I, functional power MOSFETs were demonstrated with this thin crystalline technology to establish the feasibility of this technology for power devices. This phase II effort will focus on the following specific technical challenges to bring it to market. (1) Develop power MOSFETs with improved switching characteristics using the thin crystalline technology (2) High voltage high current characterization of the thin crystalline power MOSFETs (3) Process yield and reliability characterization of package thin crystalline power MOSFET parts and (4) Convert existing process line to use thin crystalline exfoliation technology in high volume manufacturing flow.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project aims to develop a sensor with the ability to provide an accurate, small, cost-effective, and low-power device for the detection and quantification of natural gas. The current U.S. industrial natural gas leak detector market is estimated to be $325 million, while the residential natural gas detector market exceeds $2 billion, both of which indicate the strong market potential of this technology. Phage-based colorimetric sensing is a new sensing mechanism, and has the potential to replace and improve detection across many applications. This project, if successful, will have a number of broader impacts.  Firstly, 670 billion cubic feet (cf) of methane is leaked annually in the U.S. natural gas industry. Better monitoring and recapturing of the lost gas will result in less reliance on imported gas (3 trillion cf in 2015), thus stimulating economic growth and reducing waste.  Additionally, a new type of sensor that provides accurate, compact, inexpensive, and power-efficient natural gas monitoring with wireless communication capabilities will enable large scale natural gas emission monitoring studies, providing a tool for scientists and regulators.  Finally, a reduction of methane emissions will help combat climate change, as methane is a powerful greenhouse gas.

    During the Phase I project, we have successfully fabricated colorimetric thin-film sensors, developed a data analysis algorithm, and shown our sensors are both consistent and selective against individual components of natural gas at industrially-suitable sensitivity. In Phase II, we will further improve the production and performance of the phage sensors. There are six objectives in this Phase II project. The first is to do sensor calibration using precise gas calibration instrumentation to improve sensor accuracy. Secondly, the sensors will undergo environmental stress testing to evaluate longevity. Third, a scale-up feasibility study will be undertaken to determine and optimize sensor cost. The fourth task involves the development of improved and more inexpensive sensor designs, while the fifth task will optimize the production process of the new sensor. The sixth objective involves a more comprehensive characterization of the sensor.  It is anticipated that by the end of Phase II, we will have a precisely- calibrated gas sensor with data recognition algorithms, and an established and scalable manufacturing model, resulting in an improved colorimetric sensor development kit for natural gas that better meets customer needs in the field.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project includes tremendous commercial potential, societal benefits, and scientific advances. Conventional superabsorbent polymers (SAP) are based on polyacrylates or polyacrylamides derived from petroleum feedstock. They are widely used in the absorbent cores of hygiene products, with disposable diapers representing approximately 85% of the global SAP market of $6B. Increasing consumer and supply chain demand for more natural, sustainable materials and products has driven the development of eco-friendly / natural labeled absorbent hygiene products (AHP). Eco-friendly diaper products currently make up about 3% of the global market and are experiencing strong growth at 10-15% compound annual growth rate (CAGR). This project will lead to the commercialization of a low-cost high-performance biobased SAP, offering significant environmental benefits as a more sustainable, eco-friendly alternative to petrobased SAP. This project could also generate positive economic impacts on domestic agriculture by creating new demand for bio-feedstocks such as waste glycerol. Finally, this project advances the scientific and technological state-of-the-art by developing a new bioprocess based on microbial co-cultures that could be extended to render more efficient, cost-effective routes for producing other biobased fuels and chemicals.

    The objectives of this Phase II research project are to develop a new biological route, based on microbial co-cultures, for cost-effective production of gamma-polyglutamic acid (PGA) and to commercialize cross-linked PGA SAP for AHP applications. In Phase I of this project, a microbial co-culture process was developed for efficient production of PGA via in-situ precursor production (ISPP) from low-cost bio-feedstocks. materials. Building on promising results in Phase I, further R&D will aim to reach pilot-scale production by the end of Phase II. Three specific technical objectives will be pursued: Objective 1: Strain engineering and bioprocess optimization to develop an ISPP fermentation process with commercially viable performance metrics. Objective 2: Optimization of downstream purification, SAP cross-linking, and finishing to produce a high performance finished PGA SAP product. Objective 3: Pilot-scale process demonstration to produce commercial quantities of PGA SAP for large scale customer/partner trials. This R&D plan will lead to transformative technological outcomes. The proposed process based on microbial co-cultures represents a distinct shift from the conventional paradigm of utilizing single-species monocultures for bioprocessing and offers substantial cost-savings. The engineering and process development strategies developed during this project will be transferrable for a broad range of other co-culture bioprocessing applications.

    This Phase II project aims to help address the achievement gap for English Learners, who consistently average 21% below native English speakers on reading scale scores starting in 4th grade and are twice as likely to drop out of school. Eighty percent of teachers believe that materials for English Learners are sub-standard, which contributes to this gap. The project provides an online crowd-authoring and sharing platform that gives K-6 language teachers the tools to meet their unique instructional needs on demand. It is the first and only platform to enable practicing teachers to rapidly build digital language lessons and interactive games that align to their specific requirements, without any technical know-how. The platform provides built-in rich media resources that adhere to best practices based on the cognitive theory of multimedia learning. Any teacher may access these open educational resources at no cost, provided they make their own creations available for public reuse, revision and remixing. The project seeks to understand the dynamics of collaboration and quality assurance for interactive content at a massive scale. Crowd-authoring can invest educators with the power to transform language learning into a field that is highly responsive to the evolving needs of educators and learners.

    This Phase II project will pioneer mass customization of interactive games and media in the field of second language acquisition. The project aims for teachers to create 175,000 custom digital lessons and interactive games using media resources provided by the project. Phase II will develop four new types of games that improve language acquisition using audiovisual experimentation, realtime chat with artificial intelligences, and a new technology that transforms visuals and narratives composed by students into grammatically accurate text and audio. Phase II will integrate these innovations into a crowd-authoring and quality assurance system capable of scaling to 100,000 new teacher-made learning objects per month. By giving language educators tools to rapidly create, share and customize content to meet their precise needs, the project seeks to significantly improve learning outcomes. Phase II will implement real-time formative assessment reports for teachers to evaluate student experiences and issues with the custom teacher-made interactive content. A controlled full-year, multi-site educational impact study will measure whether the project affects vocabulary acquisition, comprehension, grammar and sentence formation, and whether any skill gains transfer to other contexts. It will also reveal deep data insights about the process by which K-6 students acquire a second language.

    This Phase II project proposes to develop a computer science (CS) educational software that has the potential to inspire millions of U.S. K-12 students to learn computer programming.  This software will leverage the motivational power of a popular video game, to teach CS to students by teaching them to reprogram the video game itself.  The United States currently has a severe deficit of students pursuing CS.  The Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that over 1 million computing job openings will go unfilled by U.S. workers by 2022.  By leveraging the power of a popular video game, the technology proposed in this Phase II project has the potential to expose millions of K-12 students to coding in the next 5 years.  The commercial impact of the underlying technology developed in this Phase II project does not stop at the over 100 million users who currently play the popular video game with which the current educational software integrates.  Because the underlying technology is transferable to any moddable (i.e. reprogrammable) video game, the technology has the potential to be used to teach CS with other popular titles from the rapidly growing video game industry.

    This Phase II project proposes to continue the development of a software product that is a web-based coding environment for novice programmers.  This software goes beyond the state-of-the-art technologies in this space (i.e., scratch.mit.edu) in several ways: 1) It uses automated tutoring techniques to customize the educational experiences for novices, 2) it facilitates writing programs that manipulate objects and terrain in a 3D environment, 3) it allows the novice user to reprogram a popular video game, 4) it has an in-browser, WebGL-based 3D runtime environment, 5) it supports both a novice-friendly visual programming language (Blockly) as well as a text-based language (JavaScript), 6) it leverages gamification techniques such as badges, points, and unlockable items, and 7) it supports multi-user, collaborative coding.  The objectives of this Phase II project concentrate on improving student experiences in order to increase customer retention and acquisition and to finish the development of a marketable product that will teach 5 million K-12 students in the next 5 years.  The first objective of this project involves developing and extending the browser-embedded game engine.  The second objective focuses on improving systems that match students with appropriate educational content and motivate students to continue learning.  Finally, the third objective involves implementing new systems that incentivize students to create and share with the community.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve our ability to fight infectious diseases that negatively impact agricultural yields and reduce the efficiency of global food production and distribution systems. This innovation will enhance scientific and technological understanding by leveraging the power of high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics to provide a pathogen identification and surveillance tool with demonstrated efficacy against known and unknown infectious agents. This platform is fast, sensitive, and cost-effective, and can be used for any animal sample to detect virtually all possible microbes even microbes that have never before been characterized. Hundreds of samples can be rapidly screened without relying upon known genetic/genomic data of microbes. The global molecular diagnostics market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 14% from 2012 to 2017, with infectious disease testing being the leading application at 26% share, therefore the commercial opportunity of this project is vast.

    The proposed project follows up on the validation of the diagnostic platform (SBIR Phase I) and delves deeper into improving virus detection and genetic data generation. In addition, this proposal seeks to develop a basal informatics infrastructure that together with sample preparation improvements will be conducive of scalable, high-throughput analysis of several samples. Current diagnostic methods rely on what is already known about target microbe genetics, and provide limited information in the form of presence/absence of a known target sequence. The SBIR Phase I was instrumental to lowering the technical risks associated with a high-throughput unbiased pathogen detection platform based on DNA sequencing and Bayesian statistics. In the pursue of standardizing and validating our metagenomics pathogen identification platform, this project proposes to: 1) improve viral detection capabilities and accuracy, 2) develop new functionalities, and 3) incorporate Phase I and Phase II advances into an integrated in-house web-accessible interface.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is a dramatic increase in the security of modern computer hardware. This project presents a security verification software suite that detects security vulnerabilities in electronic hardware designs. Current state-of-the-art methods for detecting security vulnerabilities in hardware designs are very informal, consisting of security teams searching for these vulnerabilities through manual code review and committee discussion. This has already been shown to be ineffective in obtaining adequate security coverage, with security vulnerabilities remaining undetected and exploitable by malicious entities. With the unprecedented growth in the number of connected devices being developed for the Internet-of-Things (IoT), the number of security vulnerabilities will increase dramatically. The broader societal impact of this SBIR Phase II project is the increased security of computing systems, leading to more effective management of personal information and increased data privacy. The commercial impact is a unique software offering to semiconductor companies to help detect and prevent security vulnerabilities that could be used to compromise an IoT device. This greatly reduces the resources necessary to achieve high security coverage and eliminates long-term liabilities that can debilitate an entire company.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on the technical development of a software suite for verifying security properties of hardware designs. The technology improves on the current methods in semiconductor companies that use manual audits in attempts to find security vulnerabilities in chip designs. It provides a systematic platform for verifying the security properties specified by the security teams on the actual hardware within these companies. This greatly improves the security coverage while reducing the time spent performing security audits. This SBIR Phase II project will develop the features requested directly by customers and perform the essential R&D efforts of the company's underlying information flow analysis technology in order to adequately solve customers' problems. The end result of this Phase II project will be a commercial grade product fit to detect and resolve security issues in modern electronic hardware designs.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop a platform to rapidly design synthetic
    organisms to produce biochemicals, which will replace environmentally harmful,
    ecologically inefficient industrial chemical processes. The technology developed
    in this proposal will provide a competitive edge in the rapid engineering of synthetic
    organisms to produce biochemicals by fermentation that are currently produced
    from oil (reducing our CO2 emissions) or extracted from natural species (reducing
    our taxing load on existing ecosystems). This technology also has the potential
    to be used for the manufacture of drugs, and to engineer novel organisms to improve
    crop production and therefore help address the mounting challenges of providing
    food to a growing world population without tapping too much in Earth's resources.
    Commercially, the chemicals that will be enabled by application of the technology
    developed during the Phase I program open up billion dollar markets that are currently
    inaccessible to the chemical industry. \n\nThis SBIR Phase II project proposes
    to develop a platform that combines computational enzyme design with systems biology
    to create a fully integrated system for the design and testing of novel cell factories
    for the production of bulk and fine chemicals. During the Phase I project, the
    company, in collaboration with the University of Washington, has successfully
    developed a high-performance software code to rapidly design novel metabolic pathways
    to produce any target chemical from central metabolism. In Phase II, the company
    will further advance the concept by (1) developing a high-performance pathway
    prioritization module to estimate each designed pathway yield and impact on organism
    metabolism in the context of whole-genome models and (2) use the software platform
    to design libraries of pathways for the production of a variety of specialty chemical
    targets that are commercially valuable and not known to be produced by fermentation
    at scale. Then, (3) using an experimental screening setup, the DNA for all the

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on a novel ultrasonic acoustophoretic separation technology that is economic, efficient, sustainable, and environmentally benign.  Current technologies, e.g., hydrocyclones, and membrane filtration, suffer from problems, such as high energy costs, use of consumables, fouling, and limited efficiency in separation of micron-sized particles.  The proposed technology does not generate waste, does not use consumables, operates at a low energy cost, and provides efficient separation for micron-size particles.  Ultrasonic standing waves are used to trap secondary phase particles in a fluid stream, when the acoustic radiation force exerted on the particles is stronger than the combined effect of fluid drag and buoyancy.  The action of the acoustic forces on the trapped particles results in agglomeration and/or coalescence of particles and droplets.  Heavier than water particles are separated through enhanced gravitational settling, and lighter particles through enhanced buoyancy.  During Phase I, successful prototypes were designed with a separation efficiency of more than 90% of a 1000 ppm emulsion at flow rates of 2500 Liters per minute.  Phase II focuses on the development of a system capable of processing 4 gpm, with fully integrated customized electronics, and testing of the system on real-world emulsions.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is that the novel acoustophoretic separation technology provides for a cheaper and lower cost of energy separation of multi- component phase mixtures.  It can function as a drop-in replacement for conventional separation technology, such as hydrocyclones and other methods.   The societal impact is the development of separation technologies that are sustainable and environmentally benign since they do not generate any waste or use consumables.  Enhanced extraction of micron-sized oil droplets from water offer opportunities for enhanced oil recovery and oil-spill cleanup and reduce the emission of micron-sized oil droplets into the environment. This project increases the science and technology behind the use of acoustic radiation force on large volume flow rate. Full numerical models will be created to use in conjunction with experimental results. Dissemination of this work will be done by publishing our results in peer reviewed journals and conferences.  This project provides several internships to undergraduate engineering students, an opportunity to learn and practice engineering, innovation, and entrepreneurship at a small start-up company.  FloDesign Sonics has a strong history and commitment to integrating undergraduate students in the development of their technology through offering internships and providing supervision for senior capstone design projects.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be in helping batteries exceed the quality, performance, and safety demands of mass-market electric vehicles, renewable energy generation, and next-generation consumer electronic devices. The need for high-performance batteries is accelerating, and as batteries grow in energy density, size, and production volumes, so will the issues that persist with quality. Unless these issues are addressed, they will continue to have major implications for the performance, safety, and adoption of these important technologies. The challenge is that outside of R&D labs, the industry relies on essentially the same basic data as when batteries were first invented: voltage, current, and temperature. As a result, at commercial scales, only a small percentage of batteries are inspected in a meaningful way, with methods that only provide indirect information about physical condition. This Phase 2 project is focused on developing a new platform for production-level battery inspection that directly probes the physical condition of batteries with a high testing throughput. This could lead to better decisions in manufacturing environments and could decrease system costs, increase capacity and operational lifetime, and accelerate the scale-up of promising new materials.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project addresses the need for a physical mode of inspection in battery production environments that is capable of screening every cell with high fidelity. Currently, inspection in production-level environments are limited to electrical measurements and X-rays. Electrical methods provide only indirect and cell-averaged information about physical condition, and X-rays are not practically able to detect the distribution of electrolyte within batteries nor the formation of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer (both of which strongly affect long-term reliability, performance, and safety of batteries). This Phase 2 project aims to develop a platform that utilizes sound-based methods to inspect batteries in production-environments. This will involve developing a scaled, automated hardware system as well as software and computational methods for processing and analyzing the acoustic signals. The Phase 2 project will also include various testing and validation efforts to assess the ability of acoustic analysis to both directly determine the performance quality and reliability of cells beyond beginning of life capacity and resistance, as well as to improve the performance of strings of cells and modules.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is provided by a novel data processing architecture, utilizing high-parallel in-memory computing for certain recurring and data intensive functions. Traditional computer architecture funnels all data through the central processing unit (CPU). Multiple CPU cores and very high clock frequencies are used to address the issue of ever increasing demands on data processing capability. However, the transportation capacity of data between memory and CPU cores has become a limiting factor creating a 'memory bottleneck'. This limitation is most noticeable in the recent and rapid development of artificial intelligence applications which deploy so called neuromorphic computing techniques, which in turn require a very high parallelism in computation and proportional demands on memory bandwidth. This project performs key repetitive operations within the memory itself, leveraging the inherent parallelism of the memory architecture, thereby avoiding a large percentage of the data transport otherwise required. The resulting elimination of the memory bottleneck provides a path forward for high complexity neuromorphic computing applications such as autonomous navigation used for self-driving cars. Reduced demands on data transport and CPU also significantly reduce power consumption, enabling a wide variety of mobile artificial intelligence applications.

    The proposed project investigates the system level integration challenges of a memory-centric neuromorphic computing approach, and aims to demonstrate a seamless integration with existing software platforms currently using traditional neuromorphic computing processors. It is important for a novel hardware platform to be compatible with existing software in order to lower barriers to market entry. This Phase II project also develops the actual semiconductor product which has been investigated in Phase I as a feasibility demonstrator. The Phase II product is based on a non-volatile high density memory architecture, and as such is expected to provide the full capability in terms of both power and operations per second. Once the hardware is available in the second half of the project, these key parameters will be thoroughly characterized and benchmarked against the current state of the art technology. A projection will be made outlining the future scaling potential using ultra high density volatile and non-volatile memory geared towards high complexity neuromorphic computing beyond what is currently possible using existing approaches.

    This SBIR Phase II project seeks to develop a novel low-cost molecular filter for use in harsh environments. This is accomplished using commodity silica gel, commonly found as a desiccant in food packing, whose pores can be made to be only a few molecules wide. Accurate tuning of the size and shape of the silica gel pores enables certain molecules to pass through while others are blocked from passing. One promising application for these molecular filters is their use in grid-scale energy storage. Flow batteries could store city-sized quantities of renewable energy. However, they require the use of expensive molecular filters that are not easily replaced due to the harsh battery environments. The low-cost filters developed during this SBIR Phase II project have the potential to reduce the cost of flow batteries by as much as 15%, making them less expensive than grid-scale lithium ion batteries. Lower cost grid-scale storage means that more renewable energy generation (e.g., solar & wind) can be added without overwhelming the grid. Low cost molecular filter also has commercial upside with the potential to capture a significant fraction of the $2.7 billion-dollar market. Because of this, this project could generate nearly 15 jobs and $39 million dollars in tax revenue over the next 5 years.


    This SBIR Phase II Project is developing a molecularly selective sol-gel ceramic membrane that does not require calcination or high polymer loading but also does not fracture during compression in stack applications (e.g., fuel cells and flow batteries). This is accomplished by decoupling the selective region from the region of the membrane being compressed by the stack. These membranes will be utilized to improve the performance and reduce the costs of all-vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFB). VRFB membranes require selective transport of hydronium ions but not vanadium ions. Size and charge exclusion membranes must therefore have tight control over the pore size, shape and network structure to selectively transport ions. Towards this end, sol-gel processing and surface charge modification will be utilized to maximize proton conductivity and limit vanadium ion permeability. Optimized membrane formulations must also have excellent chemical and mechanical stability; showing no degradation after hundreds of VRFB cycles. Finally, membranes must be scaled from lab size (50 cm2) to commercial size (> 500cm2) while maintaining performance uniformity. The low-cost membranes developed during this SBIR Phase I project have the potential to reduce the cost of VRFBs by as much as 15%. Lower cost grid-scale storage means that more renewable energy generation (e.g., solar & wind) can be added without overwhelming the grid.

    This SBIR Phase II project will expand on Phase I R&D work to build, test, and optimize a web-based software system for the classroom setting to complement the digital library app for home use developed in Phase I. This cost-effective system will further promote adult-mediated dialogic reading routines with children 0-7 years in age. Early exposure to dialogic reading has been shown to foster virtually all school and reading-readiness indicators - from cognitive and social-emotional development to vocabulary attainment and concepts about print. The new system also introduces foundational science knowledge and habits, such as the capacity to observe, experiment, and problem solve. The ever-widening education attainment and opportunity gaps between rich and poor result in diminished human potential and citizens unequipped for the demands of an information-based labor market. Investments in early childhood can prevent educational deficits, so a cost-effective system that coaches adults to engage children in a dialogic reading process can make a substantial contribution to ending school-readiness gaps - the precursor to persistent achievement gaps - and the cycle of economic and societal disadvantages they perpetuate. This project also addresses the urgent need to bolster the teaching of higher-order thinking skills by early education teachers. The market for early-education digital products is sizable and growing. Purchasers in this market are K-3 schools, preschools, Head Start, social- service agencies, and libraries, as well as individual families.


    This project will build the technical capacity to augment and measure the growth of adult-led dialogic reading with children 0-7 years in age. The systems architecture and proprietary algorithms will produce a system that increases adult capacity for dialogic questioning and exploration by using the copyrighted, text-specific guidance embedded in the library. Metrics, children's work product, and online adult-learning modules aim to incentivize and build teacher/caregiver confidence, inform school leaders, and focus them on continued application of the dialogic process to other books and subjects. Augmentations to the content management system developed in Phase I will enable the sales, distribution, management, and evaluation of all product form factors. The secure data-sharing portal and dashboard built through this project will allow institutional clients to monitor and evaluate their programs. R&D will include collection of engagement metrics, including usage data (access to which is built into the digital library) and online surveys. The core innovation to be studied is whether this product enables adults of varying educational backgrounds to practice an intellectually ambitious reading and thinking method with their children.

    This SBIR Phase II project seeks to develop an internet-of-things (IoT) data collection and analysis platform for collaborative STEM and big data research and education, that enables collaborative, geographically dispersed collection of data from internet enabled scientific instruments. STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) jobs are on the rise: the U.S. Department of Commerce predicts that occupations in these sectors will grow by 8.9 % from 2014 to 2024. Yet the U.S. currently faces a critical shortage of workers and students who are proficient in math and science subjects. In part, this shortage is due to a lack of interest in STEM-related fields by minorities and women. Engaging, relevant and hands on experiences are needed to encourage interest amongst these populations. This project fulfills the requests of the federal government and leading-edge STEM educators that both secondary and post-secondary institutions teach science in a way that engages students with real-world problems. The expectation is that this project will make big data accessible, while providing rewarding and appealing hands-on learning opportunities that will increase data literacy; increase scientific collaboration in education across geographic and interdisciplinary lines; and increase scientific literacy and interest across demographics, thus increasing the likelihood that students will continue to pursue scientific careers.

    The proposed technology will be the first collaborative educational IoT STEM platform to be developed, and is innovative in the field of Educational Technology, which has yet to adopt web-connected sensors that generate big data on a global scale. At present, there is no mechanism for schools to collect and share real data between classrooms and schools in an organized way. The proposed innovation allows users to communicate via a global network and is capable of being paired with an unlimited variety of scientific instruments and data sources, to support versatile, engaging, coordinated, multi-school experiments and data sharing. Data science now impacts virtually every profession in some way, and the platform will uniquely expose students to big data analytics in an engaging and relevant way. In Phase 1, feasibility of approach was firmly established. Phase II objectives will be to expand the educational platform developed in Phase I to optimize national/global impact and support applicability to big data research as well as a range of sensors. Goals include to expand tools to view and analyze data, refine and expand curriculum, develop an Application Programming Interface and create software tools to manipulate and share data/curriculum. The platform's ability to promote greater learning will also be evaluated.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will pilot field test controlled release polymers (CRPs) as an in situ chemical oxidation (ISCO) remediation material. With a controlled time release of the oxidant payload, the CRPs technology treats contaminated water over longer periods eliminating the occurrence of contaminant rebound resulting in overall shorter cleanup time and total cost. ISCO is the fastest growing field among sub surface contaminant remediation technologies. Current commercial ISCO deployment methods utilize liquid oxidants as reagents which possess short term reactivity (days). To address contaminant rebounding, these injectable formulations require costly re-injections. This project would result in a novel product that is environmentally  benign  and  achieves sustained release  of  oxidative  agents  over extended  treatment  periods  (months  to years)  with  a  single application. CRPs are a novel technology, offering a highly tunable remediation amendment for the $1.4B Chemical Treatment Remediation Market. Ultimately, CRPs based treatments will decrease exposure to groundwater contaminants known to cause many human health disorders.

    The technical objectives in this Phase II research project will be to field test CRPs patented, controlled release polymer technology for in situ chemical oxidation of contaminated groundwater.  To support field testing, a pilot scale manufacturing process for the initial minimum viable product established in Phase I will be developed. Manufacturability will be tested in terms of product quality and stability, throughput, and cost. CRPs formulations based on multiple oxidants, will be manufactured to address a broad range of environmental contaminants including chlorinated solvents, BTEX (benzene/toluene/ethylbenzene/xylene), PAH (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons), MTBE (methyl tert-butyl ether), and petroleum hydrocarbons. CRPs will be pilot tested at two field sites with impacted soil and groundwater. The rate and duration of oxidant delivery and contaminant degradation will be measured. In particular, pilot field testing will assess the ability of CRPs to eliminate rebounding. Field data and computation modeling will be used to create a remediation design tool to prescribe future CRP dosing deployment strategies. Collectively, this Phase II program will result in a clear understanding of in-field performance of the CRPs technology to guide future full scale deployment and market uptake.

    This SBIR Phase II project will address the lack of high application temperature materials available for additive manufacturing. Additive manufacturing, often called 3D printing, provides increased design freedom and complex features such as part consolidation and conformal cooling channels. The performance and efficiency of gas turbines and other applications can be increased by combining design improvements enabled by additive manufacturing with a suitable high temperature material. Unfortunately, existing materials either do not have sufficient high temperature performance or are not compatible with high quality printing methods. This project will develop new nickel superalloy composite additive manufacturing materials for use with high temperature gas turbine components. Successful completion of this project will result in more efficient turbines to reduce energy costs, transportation costs, and carbon emissions. The manufacturing, power generation, and aerospace industries are expected to be impacted from this project. In addition, history has demonstrated that new materials and manufacturing technologies often lead to additional unexpected innovations. This project will help the country lead in the innovation of high performance materials technology to address the needs of the $86 billion gas turbine market and to grow advanced manufacturing jobs in the US.



    This project will utilize innovative reactive additive manufacturing materials technology to develop 3D printable advanced high temperature superalloys. During additive fabrication, high melting temperature product phases will be synthesized in-situ within a superalloy matrix to significantly improve high temperature performance and improve printability. This innovative reactive additive manufacturing technology has been shown to be applicable to a wide range of materials systems including nickel superalloys in an NSF Phase I project. Metal matrix composites produced using this technology have demonstrated greatly increased strength, wear resistance, and high temperature performance relative to comparable traditional alloys. In addition, this technology has demonstrated the ability to eliminate micro and macro cracking problems with alloys that had previously been considered unprintable. This project aims to further develop one or more high temperature superalloys compatible with laser powder bed fusion additive manufacturing for use in the hot sections of gas turbines. The scope of the project includes theoretical and experimental development and evaluation of novel material feedstocks, additive manufacturing processing conditions, and heat treatments. Evaluation of printed components will include measurement of density, hardness, standard and high temperature tensile properties, creep, and microstructure and phase analysis. Turbine components will be additively fabricated for pilot studies.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project aims to provide an affordable sealant for sealing joints and cracks in cement concrete pavement, asphalt concrete pavement, bridge deck, etc. In transportation infrastructure, joints are intentionally constructed in order to allow movement of the structural elements due to linear thermal expansion/contraction when temperature rises/drops. Cracks are a common failure mode in pavement, and if not properly sealed, can cause water damage and rupture of the concrete. Sealing cracks and joints is a common practice to maintain or extend the service life of structural elements. Various types of sealants are currently used with an annual market value of about $6.1 billion. Unfortunately, many of these sealants fail to work properly and are ineffective in extending service life. In this project, a smart sealant will be developed that expands upon cooling and contracts upon heating, a thermal characteristic opposite to that of concrete. The product will address a significant problem in the industry arising from thermal movement of joined/cracked structural elements. It is expected that the product will have about 0.8% market share in 5 years helping with the need for longer lasting and more reliable infrastructure.

    The intellectual merit of this project lies in the development and validation of a smart sealant technology. The root cause for joint failure is that the thermal expansion characteristics of most sealants is similar to that of concrete, i.e., contraction upon cooling and expansion upon heating. This behavior is contrary to what is required of sealants in order to avoid thermally induced separation between the sealant and the concrete. Unfortunately, few materials can fulfill this requirement in a cost effective way while maintaining other desired physical properties (such as, deformability). This Phase II project will solve the century-long problem through the use of a two-way shape memory polymer (2W-SMP) based sealant that addresses the root cause. Building upon the feasibility study of the Phase I project, the Phase II project will focus on further improving the 2W-SMP based sealant for sealing joints or cracks in pavement, and validate the product through third-party lab-scale testing, and full-scale field-level verification in both hot and humid environment and extremely cold regions. Technical outcome will include lab-scale validation, field level performance and verification, and construction protocols for this new smart material, laying a solid foundation for adoption by home owners and transportation agencies.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will demonstrate compatibility of a novel polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) composite coating with metal-polymer bearings currently on the market, scale up the coating deposition process, and implement pilot processing lines. Currently, there is a need for a method to improve adhesion at the PTFE/metal interface while also reducing corrosion, friction, and wear. The implementation of this technology will aid in the transition from traditional lubricants to solid lubricants in manufacturing and has significant implications for the US economy and the environment. Currently, annual lubrication-related maintenance costs are as high as $1 trillion, and consumption of petroleum-based lubricants is estimated to reach 43.78 million metric tons as of 2016. The effective implementation of this technology will reduce maintenance costs and downtime by eliminating premature bearing failure. This project will serve as a proof point for the adoption of nano-coating technologies for reducing friction and wear in mechanical systems. It will also reduce barriers to entry for these coatings in industries dominated by outdated lubrication practices. The total applicable market size for metal-polymer bearings is estimated to be $1.0 billion, and a substantial near-term revenue opportunity for the proposed technology in this sector will be the focus of this effort. This beachhead opportunity serves as an industry validation point for the proposed technology and an entry point to other industrial and manufacturing applications.

    The intellectual merit of this project is based on improving the adhesion and mechanical properties of PTFE liners in metal-polymer bearings using an adhesive biomimetic polymer. This technology increases the wear-life of PTFE coatings, allowing for applications from which they have historically been precluded due to high wear and delamination. During Phase I, the proof of concept was established through demonstration of strong adhesion, 40% reduction in friction, 80% reduction in wear and elimination of susceptibility to corrosion in current metal-polymer bearings. The focus of Phase II will be in tailoring the coatings for specific product applications and implementation. The proposed SBIR Phase II work will overcome the remaining technical hurdles and validate the use of this technology as both a solution for improving the adhesion between PTFE and substrates and as a replacement for current PTFE liners in metal-polymer bearings. The execution of this project will allow the realization of critical proof points needed by industrial partners and speed the adoption of this technology into product lines.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in the development of new carbon dioxide utilization technology for the commercialization of onsite gas production. The impediment to electrochemical carbon dioxide utilization technology has been the lack of an electrolyzer design capable of high production rates and high energy efficiency. This project will yield a novel electrolyzer component to overcome these challenges and demonstrate that cost-effective carbon dioxide utilization is possible. This component can be integrated into existing electrolyzer designs, and will enable such hardware to convert carbon dioxide into specialty gases. The resulting solution will have higher safety and lower cost than conventional packaged gas. Long term, this technology could be scaled up to higher volume applications, and used as a means of converting industrial carbon dioxide emissions into useful chemicals and fuels, thereby transforming a waste product into a new revenue stream. This scalable technology could therefore be the basis for the creation of new economic value and advanced manufacturing jobs in the United States, while providing a profitable way for existing U.S. industries to reduce their emissions.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will build upon the promising feasibility results achieved in Phase I to increase the performance of a novel carbon dioxide electrochemical cell along key performance dimensions, in order to deliver a commercially-relevant, cost-competitive solution. A viable solution to derive specialty gases from a low-cost feedstock like carbon dioxide will need to have high performance on several dimensions: energy efficiency, high reaction rates, long lifetime, and low capital cost. It will also need to operate at a scale that is industrially relevant. In Phase II, the novel electrochemical component will be scaled up to commercial dimensions, and the performance of the component will be optimized to meet the performance requirements identified during customer interviews. The final component will form the basis for a commercial unit, capable of producing specialty gases from carbon dioxide at cost-competitive rates. It will lay the foundation for future scale-up to even larger membrane areas, which will enable industrial-scale applications of this carbon dioxide conversion technology. Carbon dioxide emissions could be converted into valuable products using this technology.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to enhance infrastructure for research and education by exposing a previously unavailable dataset: fine-grained human interaction with a physical environment. Humans are always building on and shaping the world but there is little hard data to further examine the effects this has. Beyond retail, this technology could affect how teachers layout classrooms, how disaster workers provide relief, or how factories keep their workers safe. The subtle physical details that affect humans everyday will be understood and investigated in ways not possible without the proposed system. This technology will benefit society by increasing economic efficiency because retailers can meet customer needs more easily. This translates into large potential commercial value because of the size of the retail market and because retailers are under pressure to deliver differentiated customer experiences that customers cannot get online or at big-box stores. Such experiences are enabled by understanding the customer at a much deeper level which in turn is enabled by the technology proposed here.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project uses sensor placement models, statistical methods, and face recognition to fully realize the commercial potential resulting from the Phase I development of a video analytics system for understanding human behavior. Research in video-based behavior recognition has seen renewed excitement because of deep learning but current work only addresses pieces of the problem. Critical missing components are robust face identification and registration, a process to install as few cameras as possible while maximizing the viewable area of a store, and video analysis results that are meaningful when combined with other data such as retail transactions. The research objectives of extracting biometric data (such as facial features) from video, automatically computing the optimal positions of cameras, and correlating behavior metrics with business operations are essential to improve the retail experience for shoppers and make the developments undertaken in Phase I more commercially relevant to potential end users of the technology.

- abstractText: "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project enables
    the development of the next generation of contact lenses for vision correction
    based on a novel photomodification technique called \"LIRIC (Laser Induced Refractive
    Index Change).\" More than 2.3 billion people world-wide suffer from refractive
    error in their visual system, while over 500 million have inadequate access to
    refractive correction. Glasses are an option for refractive correction, however
    there can be practical limitations and even social stigma associated with wearing
    glasses, particularly among adolescents. Meanwhile vision correction with contact
    lenses is limited to lenses whose optical prescription is determined by their
    thickness profile. This has negative consequences for visual quality, on-eye stability
    and corneal health. The research represents a fundamental shift in how vision
    correction is applied because it alters the refractive index of an optical material,
    enabling previously unavailable visual correctors in thin, stable contact lenses.
    LIRIC uses a high repetition rate, femtosecond laser to micro-modify the local
    medium to produce custom refractive corrections in hydrogels, and in living cornea.
    LIRIC works by accumulating localized refractive index (RI) changes in an ocular
    material to create a refractive lateral gradient index lens. \n\nChanging the
    refractive index using LIRIC instead of the surface shape can lead to several
    fundamental advances for vision correction, with profound implications for vision
    care: 1) contact lenses can be manufactured specifically for patient fit and stability
    with the refractive correction decoupled from the lens shape; 2) difficult and
    irregular refractive corrections (i.e. for irregular astigmatism, presbyopia,
    and higher order aberrations) could be written more easily and with better spatial
    resolution than with existing methods; 3) multifocal and diffractive optical designs
    can be utilized for presbyopic and macular degenerative corrections. Patients
    viewing through LIRIC lenses, created in Phase I, had visual performance (visual
    acuity and contrast sensitivity) on par with a control lens. The objective of
    the Phase II work is to demonstrate that LIRIC works in contact lenses at process
    speeds necessary for commercial manufacturing. The goal of this work is to demonstrate
    that a 6.5 mm optical zone can be successfully processed in <15 seconds. To effectively
    do so, the LIRIC process has to achieve more than 1 wave of phase change (at 555
    nm wavelength) at laser scanning velocities in excess of 10 meter/second."

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop novel algorithms for electrodynamic simulations in commercial clouds. Electrodynamic simulation is essential for computational prototyping in optical and radio-frequency devices. Current commercial solutions require significant upfront investment of both software and hardware. They also suffer from low productivity due to limited in-house computing resources. This project will develop a cloud-based simulation service which will provide on-demand, pay-per-use, virtually unlimited simulation capability without requiring users to purchase any hardware or software. This simulation technology will greatly improve productivity, reduce the barrier to entry, and minimize cost in the design of optical and radio-frequency applications. Moreover, it will serve multiple scientific and engineering disciplines and will facilitate the use of high-performance simulation in all phases of scientific discovery and engineering design. It will revolutionize large-scale scientific simulation and allow anyone with internet access to gain unprecedented simulation power. Ultimately, this technology will help accelerate research and development in the health, energy, and defense industries by offering intuitive, on-demand, and practically infinitely scalable scientific software to engineers and scientists at a price-point significantly lower than any other cloud computing service.

    There is currently no electromagnetic simulation software which performs efficiently in commercial clouds, because they were written under the assumption that the underlying computing platform is homogenous and has low inter-CPU communication time, i.e. low latency. Starting from the most fundamental level of space-time discretization, we will develop the first electrodynamic simulation software that is latency-tolerant and cloud-optimized. The work completed in Phase I developed several proof-of-concept cloud-based electrodynamic solvers and demonstrated that commercial cloud computing platform is a viable option for offering extremely low cost computing. The general solver to be developed in Phase II will serve a broad set of applications, and will be commercialized as the electromagnetic simulation service in the cloud, featuring a fully immersive web-based visualization interface.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project, if successful, will be the development of a probiotic treatment that may be used to reduce or eliminates Salmonella and other infections in poultry. The recent FDA Veterinary Feed Directive will result in the use of antibiotics being phased out of livestock production. New technologies are needed to control pathogens in the absence of antibiotics. The goal of this technology is the reduction of pathogens in pre-harvest poultry, which may result in safer food and reduced foodborne illnesses.  In addition, this technology may help reduce the amount of antibiotics used in poultry production, which has been cited as a major factor in the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

    This SBIR Phase II project will result in the development of novel antimicrobial technologies using probiotics engineered to produce antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are small proteins with remarkable bactericidal properties. During Phase I, probiotics were built successfully and tested as AMP-delivery vehicles. Probiotics are bile-resistant microorganisms that can be provided to animals safely in their food or water.  The antimicrobial probiotics will be used to test the reduction of pathogens in poultry guts. Pathogens in poultry guts are considered the major source of contamination of poultry meat during processing. The engineered probiotics will use synthetic DNA promoter regions that are designed to precisely control the delivery of AMPs at the site of infection.  The impact will be examined in field trials of probiotics with controllable AMP delivery on poultry challenged by Salmonella enteritidis and Campylobacter jejuni, two common foodborne pathogens. Antimicrobial probiotics also will be tested against Clostridia perfringens, the causal agent of poultry necrotic enteritis, an illness that causes billions of dollars in productivity losses every year in the US.

- abstractText: "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims
    to develop a MicroElectroMechanical System (MEMS)-based radio transceiver providing
    a steep reduction in operating power for wireless data transmission in battery-powered
    devices. Conventional technology offerings for such radios are numerous, but with
    10's of mW of power consumption they are unable to operate for long periods on
    batteries or scavenged power. If the low power radio promised by MEMS technology
    is realized, battery life of consumer products such as wireless headphones can
    be greatly extended, and battery size reduced, saving money and increasing convenience
    to the end user. With the spread of compact wearable and consumer devices, battery
    space is becoming increasingly at a premium, strongly incentivizing lower power
    electronics. As this technology matures, the expanding interconnection of devices
    (aka, the Internet of Things) offers yet greater potential. With rapidly expanding
    market adoption of wireless connectivity for sensing, control, and data collection,
    power consumption is becoming a major limiter in device deployment. If lower power
    transceivers are available, wired devices may be replaced by wireless and battery
    replacement cycles reduced or even done away with altogether, saving time and
    money, and paving the way to true interconnection of all things. \n\nThe work
    of this Phase II SBIR project will focus on designing and verifying performance
    of the MEMS-based radios using fabrication processes suitable for mass production
    and commercial distribution. By combining MEMS technology with traditional circuit
    design, the proposed system will enable a 10x reduction in power consumption,
    low enough that these radios will allow extended operation on battery power alone.
    In the phase I project, the feasibility of the MEMS-based receiver was tested
    using resonators compatible with currently available MEMS foundry processes, and
    power consumption of the core radio-frequency transceiver components was verified
    at a low 300 mW. In phase II, these results will be expanded upon to add the additional
    transceiver components and software stack needed for a complete commercial product.
    The resultant design will be then transferred to the commercial foundry processes
    needed for mass production. The end goal of this project is to demonstrate a complete
    MEMS-based radio compatible with the widely-used Bluetooth Low-Energy protocol
    while operating on a total of only 2 mW in receive-mode."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to develop natural alternatives to synthetic chemicals that are used to impart color to food, medicine, and cosmetics. Negative health impacts of some high volume synthetic colorants are driving demand for natural and safe colorants that are obtained from biological sources. This project will advance the commercial feasibility of a class of naturally occurring pigments that have properties of color, functionality, stability, and safety that make them attractive as food colorants. Based on six years of prior university research, a potentially suitable botanical source of a red pigment has been identified.  The goal of this project is to develop a commercial process to produce the pigment from this botanical source. The pigment will be tested as a replacement for a synthetic red pigment that has been widely used as a food additive.  The goal is to provide a natural alternative to reduce the health risks associated with artificial colorants.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop a naturally occurring red pigment from a plant source as an alternative food color additive.  Phase I demonstrated that the red pigment could be extracted at small-scale and performed well in food applications.  The goal of this Phase II project is to scale up commercial processes for extraction and purification of this red pigment, and to conduct further performance testing. The pigment, which previously has not been available in commercial quantities, will be produced from a selected variety of a major crop species. The goal is to develop processes to scale pigment production under conditions that will validate a commercial scale.  This will include the integration of mechanical separation, food grade extraction, and various commercially-available clarification systems. The products will be tested for performance characteristics and consistency of quality during scale up by examining thermal, pH, and light stability in a range of probable food and other applications.  In addition, yield produced will be evaluated to validate economic competitiveness.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II Project will continue development of a non-resorbable surgical film which prevents internal tissue-attachment. The proposed device will improve post-surgical outcomes from patients who suffer from internal tissue-attachment triggered by cardiothoracic or neurological surgery. Patients who undergo surgery are at risk for developing unwanted tissue-attachment due to trauma as a result of surgical intervention. This tissue-attachment can lead to severe complications and increase the burden of post-operative care resulting additional expenditures through extended hospital stays, readmissions, and increased morbidity and mortality rates. In addition, undesirable tissue attachment can obstruct the surgical field upon re-operation when necessary. Surgical related tissue-attachment is a problem amongst many surgical procedures in a number of areas. However, cardiothoracic and neurological procedures are often more complicated than gastrointestinal or gynecologic procedures, making any complications more expensive and risky to providers, payers and patients. Additionally, re-operations in cardiac or neuro-spine cases are extremely difficult, which underscore the need for an effective solutions to prevent this malady even more urgent. A product that can effectively prevent undesirable tissue-attachment and provide the surgeon with a clear surgical field and plane of view would be highly desirable in both cardio-thoracic and neurological surgery.

    The proposed project will conduct additional pre-clinical work leading to a regulatory submission for a cardio-thoracic indication and additional validation within the neurological field. Positive animal studies completed during Phase I & IB efforts revealed the capacity of the Sintact Film? to reduce tissue attachment and provide for a clear field of view upon re-entry or re-operation. Initial Phase II work will examine the feasibility of scaling-up certain manufacturing and production processes resulting in a clinical grade product which will undergo sterility, safety, animal, biocompatibility, and mechanical testing. This testing will be compared directly to a predicate or equivalent approved medical device. Results will need to show equivalency of the Sintact Film? to the predicate device across all testing metrics. Additional Phase II work will enable further validation of the Sintact Film? for neurological indications. A larger definitive neurological study will be completed to address the capability of the Sintact Film? to be deployed effectively in a neurological setting. Positive results from this study will provide a basis for pursuing expanded indications and additional market opportunities. If successful the implications that a non-resorbable product can be an effective countermeasure in these areas would alter the current methodology in the field.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to combat modern day slavery in the United States and Canada. In this project the company will go beyond the public sector, selling its capabilities to the hospitality industry, which shares a role in tackling this problem. Banks also play a part in detecting financial transactions which stem from criminal revenue streams. These new markets expand the revenue opportunity and social impact of the technology. The proposed Phase II research and development will solve huge challenges voiced by the company's law enforcement users. The deployment of these research products through a platform that enables evidence management and collaboration will accelerate the impact by increasing communication among the fragmented law enforcement jurisdictions in the United States. This will enable agencies to conduct more effective investigations, and empower them to take on larger cases involving organized crime across state lines. Finally, human expertise will be developed within the company and through its partnership with Carnegie Mellon University to commercialize advanced computing research for real-world, social impact. These innovations will empower more victim rescues and exploiter prosecutions. The project will create a culture within the company to nurture engineers in social entrepreneurship.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will expand on machine learning technology created in Phase I to deobfuscate escort ads and implement end-to-end innovations for investigations. Each day, there are thousands of online data points related to prostitution. Hidden behind this content are victims of sex trafficking, those forced or coerced into sex work, including juveniles who have not reached the age of consent. Big Data presents the opportunity to seize this information to disrupt traffickers and organized groups who drive the cycle of exploitation. The company's research objectives include maximizing evidence recall using sophisticated crawlers and deobfuscation methods, as well as generating leads using natural language processing and multi-modal machine learning. The project will further develop computer vision capabilities to interpret features of an image and enable visual search for missing victims. It will formalize methods for collecting ground truth, preventing false positives, and diagnosing algorithmic performance relevant to users' needs. Finally, the company will deploy this research into accessible software products that provide real-time, digestible, and actionable information to law enforcement, resulting in the rescue of hundreds, or potentially thousands, of sex trafficking victims.

    on the development of a low-cost, wireless, and energy harvesting environmental
    sensor, and a data aggregation / visualization platform to enable effective communication
    of data to users and control systems. This project addresses major barriers in
    our main market, the application of IoT to the buildings sector, where complexity
    is encountered in the placement and powering of sensors in monitoring locations
    where access is limited. By reducing the upfront and maintenance costs of wireless
    sensor networks, the project allows cost-effective building sensor data collection
    of unprecedented longevity and density. These rich data sets in turn enable myriad
    benefits, including more effective building management controls and in-depth automated

    environmental sensor would enable high-granularity sensing, feedback, and control
    to several additional markets including industrial, agricultural, and any other
    market application that would benefit from monitoring where power or access is

    Readiness Level (TRL) 7 in Phase 1 of the SBIR program, in parallel with supporting
    data infrastructure, including dynamic cloud databases, data access via API methods
    and a beta data visualization platform. Phase II of the program aims to expand
    the scope of the low-cost, wireless, energy-harvesting environmental sensor from
    a network of low-power, short-range devices to a plug-and-play building-wide sensing
    solution, which includes the incorporation of additional hardware elements, including

    develop copper based pastes for the metallization of silicon solar cells. Photovoltaics
    (PV) offer an opportunity for clean and affordable energy and over the past decade
    the PV industry has seen annual compound growth rates of over 50%. Although revenues
    are high, the profit margins for many manufacturers have substantially diminished,
    necessitating the need for cutbacks throughout the value chain. One area marked
    for cost reduction, is in the metallization of the solar cells, which now commands
    nearly 10 percent of the world's supply. Having the cost of photovoltaic panels
    tied to a precious metal with price volatility can lead to higher prices for renewable
    energy; thus replacing silver with copper is a significant opportunity for the
    industry. Thus the outcomes of this project would be a product for making solar
    energy more affordable. The project also includes creating two new full time positions
    in Kentucky in Advanced Research and Manufacturing. This proposal will enhance
    scientific understanding of the copper-silicon contact formation and durability
    of the material during operation. \n\nThe technological feasibility of the copper
    pastes with an inherent diffusion barrier was demonstrated on standard and bifacial
    solar cells in Phase I. Phase II will further improve the screen printable pastes
    to industry standards. To achieve the high electrical performance required in
    this market, the project will investigate the copper-silicon interface to investigate
    the mechanisms involved during contact formation, and the chemical nature of the
    copper-silicon interface. This information will be used to optimize the chemical
    composition and thermal treatment of the pastes to improve electrical performance
    and cell lifetime. The pastes will be optimized for industrial operating equipment
    to provide the manufacturer with a product that can be dropped in, with minimal
    changes to the production line. Phase II will also involve scale up of the core
    materials in the pastes to be able to engage customers in further printing trials.
    Through the assembly and testing of prototype solar cell modules, the durability
    of the copper contacts will be demonstrated. The outcomes of this proposal will
    be screen printable copper pastes that can be direct drop in replacement for the
    silver pastes; thereby enhancing the profit margins of the solar cell manufacturer."

    Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is far-reaching in terms of improving the quality
    of life and the cost/efficacy of healthcare for more than 20 Million people in
    the USA. We address the need for better methods for identifying and guiding the
    treatment of ambulatory patients with dangerous heart dysfunctions such as intermittent
    arrhythmias and heart failure. For example, atrial fibrillation arrhythmia afflicts
    nearly 8 Million patients in the USA, approximately 460,000 new patients every
    year, and the patient load is projected to grow to 12.1 million by 2050. The disease
    and its complications (stroke, congestive heart failure, seizures, death, etc.)
    add $26B to the nation's annual healthcare costs. Heart Failure currently afflicts
    nearly 5.7 Million people in the US growing to 8 Million by 2030. Their treatment
    and frequent hospitalization costs are already at 14B$ and will grow to 29B$ by
    2030.  Together with reducing the economic impacts, it would be of an enormous
    benefit to human health to create a device that improves the diagnosis and guides
    effective therapy for these patients while they remain fully ambulatory and going
    about their normal activities outside the expensive confines of the hospital.\n
    \ \n\nThe proposed project has the following intellectual merits. In our Phase
    I STTR program we focused on developing a wearable Atrial Fibrillation monitor
    to assist physicians in the diagnosis of paroxysmal or episodic versions of that
    disorder. In Phase II we have pivoted towards the even more critical need of ambulatory
    monitoring of paroxysmal tachycardia and eventually heart failure patients. The
    current industry standard of ambulatory ECG does not provide enough sensitivity
    or specificity to determine if the patient has atypical or typical atrial flutter,
    paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia as well as various forms of ventricular
    tachycardia. Accurately diagnosing and monitoring these disorders is critical
    to patient treatment and outcomes. Our device will be capable of ambulatory patient
    monitoring for any sort of arrhythmia, and we believe it can be the preferred
    choice for all portable monitoring if it provides in one device ECG, heart motion
    and breathing rate/pattern/volume. So, the overarching technical research goal
    of our Phase II work is to develop a full featured prototype cardiac motion sensor
    as described above that can be used for initial clinical tests. These features
    include: wearable, battery powered, signal storage, cardiac motion from radar,
    disposable antenna, onboard ECG, and breathing rate."

    process parameters for maximum yield, maximum purity, and minimum processing times
    at pilot scale. The first stage will be to successfully obtain production yields
    of 90+% and purity levels of 99+% in pilot scale batches. For the second stage,
    we will focus on scaling production to prove commercial-scale feasibility, with
    ideal product yields and purities of 95+% and 99+% respectively. Throughout all
    stages, we will focus on understanding and treating the accompanying waste products,
    including wastewater and residual metal impurities."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II Project is to produce economically the next generation of sustainable, renewable, clean burning, high energy density, transportation biofuels. The proposed technology once successfully developed will enable existing biofuel producers to reduce their costs while increasing the value and diversity of their byproducts. It will convert their industrial waste products into tailored fatty acids suitable for biodiesel. The technology will be compatible with and complementary to cellulosic ethanol producers, and it could potentially double the amount of biodiesel produced in the U.S. today. The 227 domestic ethanol plants range in size from less than 50 to more than 150 million gallons, and they have a total annual capacity of 15 billion gallons. Every gallon of ethanol also yields 1.9 pounds of soluble organics that must be evaporated or disposed. Xylome?s technology has the potential to convert half of this stream into biodiesel and to expand biodiesel production further with cellulosic feedstocks. By converting a larger fraction of the soluble cellulosic and hemicellulosic sugars along with fermentation byproducts, Xylome will increase the efficiency of existing ethanol plants and increase biofuel production.

    The objectives of this Phase II research are to increase the rates of production, modification and release of fatty acids from non-conventional lipogenic yeast.  Fatty acids have much higher energy density than ethanol, but similar specific energy yields. Fermentation of organics to lipids can potentially occur with efficiencies equivalent to ethanol production. Lipids normally accumulate under nitrogen limiting conditions after replication has stopped. They are not excreted from the cells so recovery does not require distillation. In Phase I, Xylome scientists identified and over expressed genes that increase lipid accumulation by 1.2- to 2-fold under high nitrogen conditions. In Phase II, they will use mating, selection, screening and evolutionary adaptation to combine the best of these modifications. Xylome scientists have also targeted additional genes to modify and release fatty acids from the cell. Xylome plans to optimize lipid production both from a cellular level with metabolic engineering and from an engineering perspective through bioprocess design and cultivation conditions. Xylome will also engineer cells to use rapidly the complex mixture of soluble oligosaccharides, hemicellulosic sugars and fermentation byproducts. By applying advanced molecular techniques and synthetic biology, Xylome will open up new opportunities for sustainable biofuel production.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to improve wheat yield globally by deploying newly developed, region-specific dwarfing genes. World population is predicted to grow to 9.6 billion by 2050. Wheat demand is expected to increase also due to a shift from rice to wheat consumption due to an expected increase in wealth around the globe. The increased wheat demand will have to be met under less land area and changing climate. Water use efficiency and increase in wheat yields will be important factors in meeting this demand. The proposed technology is poised to increase wheat yield under abiotic stress conditions. All of these benefits are expected to have a major positive impact on humanity.  The wheat seed business is currently valued at up to $8.3 billion. The proposed technology will provide a competitive advantage to capture a significant market share of the wheat seed industry while contributing positively towards food security during the changing climate.

    This SBIR phase II project proposes to further develop and test alternative dwarfing genes to improve wheat yield and abiotic stress tolerance around the globe. Responsible for the "green-revolution," dwarfing genes are required to obtain higher yields, but the two dwarfing genes present in more than 90% of the currently grown wheat varieties have serious ill-effects including abiotic stress sensitivity, reduced root length and biomass, seedling emergence, and vigor. During the Phase I research, four new dwarfing genes were identified and shown to be significantly better than the currently used genes. Phase II will focus on the comparison of the new genes with the old genes to show their true benefits. This research also will generate valuable data required for the development of "release-ready" varieties.  Genetic background effects will be studied by transferring one of the new dwarfing genes into two different backgrounds followed by field and controlled condition evaluation. Future competitive advantage will be maintained by pyramiding the new dwarfing genes with complementary gene action. Closely linked DNA markers will be developed for an efficient transfer of the technology into diverse backgrounds.

The construction market in the US is approximately 8% of GDP.  Any portion of the market that could be enhanced would have a large impact in the US economy.  To that end, Branch is creating a process similar to building found in the natural world.  In the formation of natural systems, material is the most expensive commodity; a structure is derived by the efficient use of material, but shape is free to be created in almost any form.  Branch can approach this efficiency with additive manufacturing, where form is created and material is deposited only when needed and little waste is created. At the core of Branch's method of AM-based construction are three key developments: a three-dimensional freeform structure (the cellular matrix or lattice) which serves as a scaffold for other materials, a robotically- controlled extrusion mechanism by which the cellular matrix is produced, and the algorithms necessary to control the robot for successful production.  The proof of concept for this process and more have already been demonstrated by Branch in Phase I of this grant.

    The technical objectives for Phase II focus on improving the procedures and technology already created. The focus areas for this phase are algorithm development, hardware improvements, the application of finishing materials, code compliance testing, and material science experiments. Algorithm development consists of refining and creating the software necessary to extrude the printed matrix and support a client base. Hardware improvements are necessary to improve the speed and efficiency of the process to create a commercially viable workflow. This research will necessitate the purchase of extra hardware for experimentation.  American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) testing for load bearing capacity is necessary to enter the market and provide code compliant construction. Experimentation in the application of finished materials to the 3D printed lattice such as spray foam and concrete are vital to the realization of complete buildings.

    Transfer (STTR) Phase II project, in which a non-invasive respiratory muscle stimulation
    device and approach to weaning patients from mechanical ventilation will be developed,
    is a reduction in public health care expenditure and a reduction in morbidity
    for the half a million patients who have difficulty weaning from mechanical ventilation
    each year in the US. These patients suffer from an array of clinical complications
    (for example, pneumonia) and cost the US health care system $16 billion annually,
    a great deal of which is borne by Medicare and Medicaid. In addition, the current
    reimbursement landscape economically incentivizes hospitals to wean patients at
    the earliest possible time. The proposed innovation has the potential to positively
    benefit society by providing a solution to this serious healthcare problem. In
    addition, it promises to improve our scientific understanding of respiratory muscle
    physiology and mechanics in difficult to wean patients. It will also improve our
    technical understanding of non-invasive respiratory sensors and biofeedback algorithms
    for the purposes of electrical muscle stimulation. Finally, as demonstrated by
    the number and cost of difficult to wean patients, as well as current healthcare
    reimbursement policies, the proposed innovation has potential to results in a
    considerable commercial impact.  \n \nThe proposed project will develop a non-invasive
    electrical stimulator that automatically applies stimulation to the respiratory
    muscles in synchrony with a patient?s voluntary breathing pattern. This approach
    is expected to address the imbalance between respiratory muscle strength and respiratory
    muscle load - a major factor responsible for weaning difficulty - by assisting
    ventilation during weaning sessions and strengthening the breathing muscles that
    have become weakened as a result of mechanical ventilation. In Phase 1 a functional
    prototype was developed; clinical feasibility of the approach was also demonstrated.
    \ The Phase II proposal focuses on refining the stimulation algorithm to maximize
    its clinical effectiveness and on developing a novel stimulation electrode system
    so that the device can be quickly applied to patients. In addition, methods will
    be developed to interface the technology with a mechanical ventilator to expand
    its clinical application. Finally, a complete works-like, looks-like prototype
    will be developed that is designed to international standards and is safe for
    clinical testing. The work completed in this Phase of the project will enable
    a controlled clinical trial of the proposed approach and ultimately allow the
    device to gain FDA regulatory clearance."

    adaptive online learning platform founded on the principles of adaptive learning.
    The online learning system provides adaptive learning strategies with real-time
    learner analytics. The system integrates learner analytics from four dimensional
    aspects of learning: multi-media, learning strategies, interactivity, and social
    interaction-- to deliver a personalized learning experience for science, technology,
    engineering, and math (STEM) students for significant improvement in the learning
    outcome. The adaptive learning software technology platforms with personalized
    learning strategies have demonstrated high completion and satisfaction rates for
    online students taking post-secondary courses. In this SBIR Phase II we propose
    to develop a unique data driven decision support interface that will result in
    real-time big data analytics for both individuals and large numbers of learners.
    The volume, velocity, variety, and veracity (the 4 Vs of big data) will be generated
    by the collection of data at individual schools first, with the potential to aggregate
    data from district, state, and even national levels.  The big-data analytics of
    the learner trajectories through the adaptive learning platform will uncover patterns
    that can improve understanding of learner behavior in education.  \n\nBig data,
    generated by the adaptive learning systems related to learner behavior in each
    learning strategy, will lead to valuable insights on efficacy of the proposed
    methodology and further development of the product on mobile platforms in the
    Phase II.  The learner analytics will provide the basis for intelligent feedback
    based on the statistical evidence.  The proposed method of data driven decision
    process for adaptive learning is based on the real- time cross-correlation statistical
    analysis of the predictor variables for an individual learner.  The field trials
    of the proposed method will be conducted in the participating high schools.  Collection
    of data for a group of students collected during the field trials in high schools
    will lead to discovery of learning patterns for the clusters of learners in each
    learning strategy. The previous Phase I research has led to the development of
    an analytical model for volume, velocity, variety, and veracity of data collected
    at school-wide level.  This reports form this data is used for the development
    of decision tree and regression analysis to find correlations (knowledge discovery)
    that can be used for the improvement of learning enterprise (school). The data-driven
    feedback to students and the group analytics for teachers will provide necessary
    feedback mechanism for improving competency and graduation rates for STEM education
    in schools and colleges."

    public speaking skills and prepare students with better oral communications skills
    necessary to perform job tasks. Oral expression is the most highly valued ability
    throughout the economy and ranks as the second most highly-valued skill for high-wage,
    high-growth, high-skill occupations. Approximately 4.5 million college students
    take a basic communications course each year, however, as class sizes get larger
    and online learning becomes more common, public speaking instruction becomes increasingly
    difficult.  Practice and feedback are essential aspects of these courses, yet
    it is a struggle for teachers to find enough time to sufficiently interact with
    students. This SBIR project aims to develop the key concepts of automated public
    speaking assessment such that a student?s vocal delivery can be objectively measured
    and presented in a manner that creates an independent, personalized learning experience.
    Unlike traditional methods of public speaking assessment, the proposed system
    can be available at any time, provide objective feedback and track student practice
    and improvement. The proposed Software-as-a-Service is projected to generate $16
    Million in revenue over five years and create more than 25 high-paying, US-based
    jobs. \n\n\nThis Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes
    to develop an automated assessment system for public speaking that determines
    how a speaker would be perceived by an audience.  Automated assessment for speech
    has already occurred in spoken language proficiency, which leverages Automated
    Speech Recognition (ASR) and semantic analysis. Automated voice assessment has
    also been utilized in lie detection and emotion detection, which focus on autonomic
    responses in the user?s voice, such as when stress affects the vocal cords. The
    hypothesis behind this SBIR project is that speakers can consciously use and modify
    non-semantic speech behaviors to produce more desirable listener perceptions.
    Automatically linking listener perception to speech behaviors represents a novel
    direction in automated assessment for speech. The Phase II objective is to develop
    software sufficient for automated public speaking assessment such that a student?s
    vocal delivery can be objectively measured and presented in a manner that creates
    an independent, personalized learning experience. Voice analytics capability investigated
    in Phase I will be enhanced and developed into a cloud-based service which helps
    students practice, track, and improve their public speaking habits."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to accelerate advancement in high-mobility materials.  These materials are being increasingly used in the electronics device industry.  This project's goal is to enable better devices by providing complete data on the effects of manufacturing processes and better enabling their optimization.  Innovative electronic device structures such as faster computer chips, and more powerful RF circuits require development of smaller and smaller devices employing more advanced materials.  The innovation that is being advanced through this Phase II program directly impacts this development.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a deployable system to directly measure high-resolution mobility, resistivity, and carrier concentration profiles for high-mobility semiconductor materials.  Current electrical profiling methods provide partial data for these material systems that form the basis of the multi-billion dollar semiconductor logic device and RF/power chip industries.  The objectives of this Phase II program are to further demonstrate a prototype by developing and integrating high-reliability sub-systems to build a beta-level measurement tool with nm-level resolution.  This is expected to reduce the semiconductor wafer area needed to evaluate high-mobility materials, and develop the measurement capability to target all high-mobility materials with potential applications in IC and RF/power industries.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development and scale-up of a manufacturing
    platform for producing bio-based chemicals for application in lubricants. This
    manufacturing platform will utilize biologically derived sugar carbon-source and
    transform this carbon to higher value products via microbial fermentation. In
    contrast to the complex mixture of fatty acids currently produced in the oleochemical
    industry, the technology developed in this project will deliver a product stream
    containing simpler mixtures of monounsaturated fatty acids, which will eliminate
    the costly separation cost and be directly used to synthesize cost-efficient high-performance
    lubricants. Due to the improved lubrication performance of these molecules, this
    technology will potentially increase the energy efficiency of industrial and transportation
    machinery. By utilizing biological carbon feedstocks and producing bio-degradable
    products, this technology has the potential to reduce the environment footprint
    of the lubricant industry. More beneficial impacts are anticipated as we expand
    the application of monounsaturated fatty acids into other industries, such as
    surfactants and polymers. A large commercial potential of this technology has
    been identified in the lubricant market, currently valued at $123B per annum,
    and predicted to grow to $178B per annum in the next 5-years. \n\nThis SBIR Phase
    II project proposes to develop technology that will deliver novel bio-based monounsaturated
    fatty acids that provide new chemical structures allowing innovations in lubricants
    not possible from petroleum-based raw materials. Based on successful development
    of bacterial strains capable of producing enriched monounsaturated fatty acids
    in the Phase I project, the Phase II project will further de-risk the technology
    and scale up the capability to produce sufficient quantities of monounsaturated
    fatty acids to be evaluated by potential customers.  By optimizing and scaling
    up the fermentation process and developing the product extraction procedure, large
    quantity of the first generation product (55% enriched monounsaturated fatty acids)
    will be produced. It will be used to chemically synthesize high-performance lubricants
    (i.e., polyol esters), whose physical-chemical and tribological properties will
    be evaluated and provided to potential customers. In this project, metabolic engineering,
    system biology, and evolutionary strategies will be applied to further improve
    the strains for producing second generation products that are more enriched in
    monounsaturated fatty acids (70-80%) and achieve commercial viable technology
    metrics. The monounsaturated fatty acids are envisioned as platform chemicals
    for subsequent chemical conversion to numerous specialty chemicals that have applications
    in additional markets, such as surfactants and polymers."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will be to improve cleaning in the food processing industry by integrating hyper-stable enzymes into cleaning products. Industrial enzymes are a growing, multi-billion dollar green industry that reduces energy, water, and harsh chemical use while improving process efficiency in many sectors. Despite the broad use and success of industrial enzymes, their application and economic impact has been severely limited by narrow thermal and chemical operational ranges available. The company has developed heat and acid stable enzymes that significantly expand the reach of enzyme applications. The goal is to develop an initial product for the dairy cleaning market that will have the potential to increase production due to faster cleaning, achieve better removal of protein contaminants and biofilms, reduce water usage, and reduce food product exposure to chemicals and chemical waste. Better cleaning with enzymes has the potential to prevent food-borne illness, and decrease water use, while increasing food-processing profits and providing a biodegradable alternative to chemical cleaners.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to demonstrate the feasibility of using the first practical protein expression platform to produce hyperstable enzymes for commercial use. Although the genes from extreme organisms have been studied for over forty years, their commercial potential has not been realized due to their incompatibility with traditional protein expression systems. The unique hyperstability of enzymes produced using the company's technologies indicate that enzyme stability is not encoded entirely by gene sequence. In Phase II, the goal is to develop more comprehensive cleaning formulations and test these with laboratory and field trial methods established in Phase I. The project encompasses a set of integrated experiments spanning molecular biology, microbiology, biochemistry, dairy processor field trials, and practical industrial bioprocess optimization. The aim is to transform the world's most extreme enzymes into the world's most effective products for membrane defouling and sanitation in the dairy industry and beyond.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to offer custom crafted digital voices for text-to-speech applications. Each one of us has a unique voiceprint - an essential part of our self-identity. Though the quality of text-to-speech technology has improved, voice options remain limited. For the 2.5 million Americans (and tens of millions worldwide) living with voicelessness who rely on devices to talk, access to a custom digital voice is a game changer. It's the difference between a functional solution and being heard, uniquely, as oneself. Enhanced opportunities for social connection increase quality of life, independence, and access to educational and vocational resources that can narrow the gap between those with and without disability. This immediate unmet societal need, coupled with the increasing proliferation of devices that speak to us and for us, creates a compelling, timely and significant commercial opportunity for high quality, personalized digital voices that can be produced at scale. By leveraging the company's crowdsourced human voicebank and proprietary voice matching and blending algorithms the technology has the potential to empower everyone to express themselves through their own voice.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project builds on the company's NSF-funded research and Phase I results that support feasibility and commercialization of a customized voice building technology. The text-to-speech market, encompassing assistive technologies, enterprise and consumer applications, is currently valued at around $1B and is rapidly growing and ripe for innovation. To create custom voices, the company leverages the source-filter theory of speech production. From those who are unable or unwilling to record several hours of speech the company extracts a brief vocal sample - even a single vowel contains enough 'vocal DNA' to seed the personalization process. Identity cues of the source are then combined with filter properties of a demographically and acoustically matched donor in the company's voicebank. The result is a voice that captures the vocal identity of the recipient but the clarity of the donor. Phase II technical objectives address the need for 1) customer-driven voice customization, 2) quality assurance of crowdsourced recordings, 3) voice aging algorithms, and 4) targeted donor recruitment algorithms. These advances will help secure the assistive technology beachhead and spur innovations for broader applications such as virtual reality, personal robotics, and digital persona for the Internet of Things.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is to provide the paint and coatings industry with new high-performance, cost-competitive polymer/resin systems that reduce solvent emissions and use of petrochemicals.  In addition, these new polymer/resin systems enable one-component, ambient-cure coatings to be produced.  This means that highly protective coatings can be produced without the need for mixing multiple components together prior to application or applying heat or light to cure the coatings.  The one-component, ambient-cure features of these polymer/resin systems largely eliminate waste and energy costs associated with coating application and lend themselves to the production of paints and coatings that can be applied by the average person.  Compared to the current state-of-the-art in one-component, ambient-cured resins, these new polymer/resin systems provide dramatically shorter drying times, dramatically better chemical resistance, and much higher film hardness, while exhibiting excellent impact resistance and flexibility.  The highly desirable properties of these new cost-competitive polymer/resin systems will enable commercial success, while their low solvent emissions and high renewable content will reduce impact on the environment.

    The objectives of this Phase II research project are to: 1) further optimize the polymer/resin systems to produce compositions that minimize solvent content and maximize performance, while meeting the cost constraints of the market; 2) put in place a pilot-line to provide potential customers with adequate sample sizes to enable their own evaluation of potential products, 3) generate weathering, corrosion, and storage/shelf stability data to further understand the application potential of optimized polymer/resin systems; and 4) optimize the polymer/resin production process to minimize cost and minimize production waste.  By meeting these objectives, the Phase II project will result in the generation of new polymer/resin systems that will enable the development and commercialization of new paints and coatings that are one-component, ambient-cured, low in solvent content that exhibit exceptional properties, while being primarily based on renewable materials.  Optimized polymer/resin systems will be provided to potential customers for their own internal evaluation.  If necessary, feedback from customer evaluations will be used to modify polymer/resin system composition to meet customer needs.  By the end of the Phase II project, the technology will be ready to proceed to manufacturing scale-up and product commercialization.

- abstractText: "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project aims to
    deliver a cost-effective automated quality control (QC) system for manufacturing
    of radioactive drugs used in Positron Emission Tomography (PET). This system will
    replace current QC procedures, which involve 18 manual operations, 8 visual assessments,
    6 devices, and 8 samples of radioactive drugs. The industry's current reliance
    on manual operation, subjectivity and untraceable records impedes progress in
    radioactive drug manufacturing and presents compliance risks. Therefore, introduction
    of an automated system combining all these tests on a single platform will facilitate
    adoption of PET imaging technology beyond top tier medical centers. By addressing
    a critical current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) compliance need in radio-pharmaceutical
    production, which cannot be addressed with any other solutions available today,
    this solution is positioned for rapid adoption.  After adopting this system, it
    is expected that manufacturing facilities will realize 20% operating cost reduction
    and 50% reduction in time spent on QC-related activities. A reduced cost of compliance
    associated with introduction of automated QC will further contribute to the adoption
    rate.  This project will open the door to new applications of plate reader technology,
    an approach which has been traditionally confined to the fields of biochemistry
    and diagnostics.  \n\nThis Phase II effort includes four technical objectives.
    \ Firstly, the approach will be adapted to minimize the required sample volume.
    \ Methods developed in Phase I of the project required 0.5 ml of sample, a value
    which is not optimal for small manufacturers. To bring this value down to 0.2
    ml, test sensitivity will be adjusted, keeping in mind the potential dynamic range
    trade-offs.  Secondly, we will design a plastic consumable that supports adoption
    by a commercial manufacturer.  Current plastic prototype components are only suitable
    for academic sites with highly-skilled personnel.  To reduce the amount of training
    required, and to expand the applicability of this method, a new plastic component
    will be designed in order to further automate sample loading.  Third, we will
    optimize the formulation of the reagents to achieve a one-year shelf life for
    the consumable kit.  The shelf life of the reagents developed in Phase I remains
    unknown.  Therefore, accelerated stability studies will be performed to estimate
    the rates of decomposition processes, and appropriate changes will be made to
    enhance shelf life. Finally, we will develop a pilot production process for the
    newly-designed kit, in order to support early installations."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to produce a new type of computer memory called Ferroelectric Dynamic Random Access Memory (FEDRAM). FEDRAM is cheap and can be mass-produced in current semiconductor manufacturing facilities. It also uses much less energy than current-state-of-the-art memories, and enables electronic devices to be much smaller in physical size. Commercially, FEDRAM works best as an embedded memory, which means they are ideally suited for products such as mobile phones where the processor and memory are on the same chip. Additionally, the same block of FEDRAM can be configured for high performance applications in addition to longer storage applications. This means that future devices will adapt to maximize power, performance, and usability. Due to the factors of price, performance, and low power, once FEDRAM is proven to work, it can potenitally be adopted in nearly every electronic device.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the commercialization questions of Ferroelectric Dynamic Random Access Memory (FEDRAM).  In SBIR Phase I, it was shown that FEDRAM cells can be manufactured in an existing foundry with no new materials or equipment changes, and that FEDRAM has leading performance characteristics. The next step is to prove the same characteristics in an array, which would be considered a minimum viable product; this is the goal of SBIR Phase II. By proving this array,  it will be possible to quickly scale the FEDRAM memory array into embedded applications for commercial deployment.  The performance characteristics to be demonstrated are read/write latency, switching time, endurance, retention, and energy use.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop and produce a robust, hand-held, video-rate three-dimensional surface metrology system with vertical and lateral resolution of several micrometers, in order to bridge a critical existing metrology gap for precision-machined surfaces.  Many modern manufactured parts, such as turbine blades, drive shafts, orthopedics, and various additive manufactured components require in-situ metrology with high resolution for accurate characterization during manufacturing and/or maintenance operations.  Current high-resolution surface measurement systems are slow, vibration-sensitive and laboratory-based and thus are impractical for everyday use by manufacturing technicians.  Meanwhile, shop-floor inspection is often only visual, and thus qualitative rather than quantitative, leading both to rejections of acceptable components as well as potential acceptance of failing ones.  The absence of high-precision, in-situ metrology has hindered manufacturers from applying real-time data analysis and closed-loop process controls that can improve yields and reduce manufacturing costs.  This research program will yield a hand-held, easy-to-use, robust, and quantitative shop-floor measurement system, allowing manufacturers to improve lifetimes, performance, and yield as they rapidly assess the features under test and feed the results back to improve process control.

    During Phase I, a breadboard system was designed and implemented using a polarization-based fringe projection method and micropolarizer phase-mask technology to achieve vibration insensitive measurement in a compact package.  This Phase II program leverages that research to design a video-rate, compact, robust and portable system for handheld surface measurements in shop-floor environments. This will first involve improvements to measurement resolution with an improved optical design and new self-calibrating measurement modes; new optical elements will lower noise artifacts caused by imperfections in the earlier design and to reduce system size.  Once performance of the new design is verified, an ergonomic, compact, robust, wireless housing for the instrument must be created to enable shop-floor use; the system must handle drops of over one meter onto concrete, have useful battery life for extended field operations, be light enough to not fatigue users and have intuitive controls and feedback.  A final, critically important development effort will create automated software routines for measurement, analysis, and system diagnostics to enable adoption by unskilled personnel in manufacturing environments.  Lastly, extensive applications testing in the field will allow optimization of the system to handle a wide range of potential use cases and environments.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in the creation of commercial viability for 3-D printing unique ceramic structures by transforming 3-D printing of advanced ceramics into mass-production additive manufacturing.  This will be a new capability for the US. The 3-D structures being considered can't be easily made with traditional manufacturing techniques but have significant advantages over traditionally manufactured geometries. If 3-D printed structures could be manufactured economically, the societal impact could be tremendous ranging from creation of hundreds of US manufacturing jobs to reduction in CO2 emissions. Commercially viable products that can improve existing markets and enable new markets are realistic expectations. Structures for improved filtration, catalytic production of clean fuels, H2 reformers, emission controls for stationary fuel cells, and CO2 sequestration have been inspired by Other Equipment Manufacturers and are already being jointly developed as a result of Phase I progress. Interestingly, these products and more could be produced from the same product lines just by changing a computer program. This great efficiency of infrastructure is a fortunate trait of additive manufacturing. In short, this project will position Robocasting Enterprises as a US exporter into world-wide markets for economic and societal benefit.

    This project is based on foundational technology called robocasting for 3-D printing ceramic materials.  Robocasting is an additive technique demonstrated to be useful for rapid fabrication of ceramics into advanced lattice structures for enhanced filtration and catalytic performance.  However, robocast products have been largely limited to products with dimensions less than 2 inches because of problems related to cracking. The goal of this project is to make additive manufacturing much more commercially viable for ceramics by: (a)  overcoming the technical challenges for robocasting large ceramic parts and; (b) designing and implementing a scaled-up manufacturing line commercially competitive with traditional manufacturing processes and production from low-wage countries. To achieve these goals; materials, processes, and equipment improvements are required.  Developments will include:  1) material innovations to reduce cracking in large ceramic bodies; 2) processing innovations to reduce cracking in large ceramic bodies; 3) equipment and automation innovations to increase production rates. At the end of Phase II it is anticipated that rapid manufacturing of large (i.e., 5-10 inch) advanced ceramic lattice structures will be demonstrated to be commercially viable and penetration into several markets will be significant.  The technology will be perfectly poised for investment from larger companies and Phase III growth.

    The broader impact / commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is to advance the state of knowledge and industrial practice toward cleaner, cheaper, greener steel and stainless steel.  The project will focus on the production of iron, part of a $1.1 trillion annual market worldwide, and ferrochromium, a $2.2 billion worldwide annual market.  Molten oxide electrolysis with an inert anode has been demonstrated at the laboratory scale to produce low-carbon iron and ferroalloys, which are the basis of many high-performance steels.  The current low-carbon metals sell at a premium.  Published cost models show that both the capital and operating cost of MOE will be lower than competing technologies already in the marketplace.  MOE can also reduce the environmental impact of producing these metals, even with today's electricity, and can produce even greater improvements with renewable energy.  In summary, MOE will produce primary metals of higher quality at a lower cost and with lower environmental impact than current methods.

    The objective of this Phase II research project is to develop a cheaper, more energy efficient route to production of important metals including iron and ferrochromium. Economical separation of these metals from their ores by molten oxide electrolysis (MOE) is enabled by the recent invention of an inert anode material. The essential next step in understanding the behavior of the new inert anode in MOE is longer-duration testing than was possible in the laboratory cell. This test can only be achieved at a larger scale. The models and testing on surrogate systems in Phase I have shown the way to provide this long-duration testing in Phase II.  These tests will point the way toward industrial-scale production of iron and ferrochromium by MOE.

    the production process. Additionally, the utilization of existing material handing
    manufacturing equipment at licensee facilities, where possible, will be evaluated.
    Expected project results will include a comprehensive statistical analysis of
    multiple physical samples, as well as a corresponding failure analysis. Additional

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to increase the efficiency of domestic oil production. Using current methods, the oil industry is able to extract only 5% of the known hydrocarbon from shale formation. This represents more than $500B of potential oil and gas that cannot be economically produced for the US economy. The aim is to increase the efficiency of oil production by providing novel subsurface information to improve operational decision making. The resulting value increase for a producer can be up to $1M per well. In addition, it is possible to significantly reduce the environmental impact of the hydraulic fracturing process, which is currently only 50% efficient. By providing novel subsurface data for the industry, this information can reduce environmental impact by saving up to 45B gallons of fresh water and 1M rail cars of mined sand. Furthermore, the analysis of subsurface microbiomes is a rich area for new academic knowledge.  Over 80% of the microbial strains identified in Phase I have never been documented in public references. This work not only provides economic and social value, but also expands scientific knowledge.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to use next-generation microbiome analyses to increase the efficiency of domestic oil production. The research objective is to analyze the subsurface hydrocarbon microbiome to characterize hydrocarbon reservoirs and leverage this new data source to increase current efficiency rates. The goal is to analyze 50 producing wells in the Southwestern US, and develop statistical models linking microbial profiles to key reservoir properties that can increase production efficiencies. The analytical method employed will utilize technology stemming from over $20 million in government funding to the University of Colorado used to create bioinformatics software known as "QIIME."  The QIIME technology has been extensively tested in analyzing and modeling the human microbiome, but has never been applied to the subsurface hydrocarbon microbiome prior to the Phase I work.  By combining advances in cloud computing, DNA sequencing, and novel software analytics, this project will demonstrate that these microbial communities correlate to meaningful production parameters for the oil and gas industry. In so doing, the project will demonstrate at pilot scale that this new information source can be utilized as a novel, non-invasive, low-cost reservoir characterization tool that allows the industry to maximize hydrocarbon production while minimizing environmental impact.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project supports development of a nanoparticle characterization instrument that will fill the critical unmet need to rapidly and accurately measure the size and distribution of nanoparticles from 30 nanometers to 1 micron. Initially the technology will target two applications: protein aggregation in biopharmaceuticals, and nanoparticles in medicine (e.g., tumor-targeted drug delivery). The importance of nanoparticle analysis, however, goes well beyond therapeutics. Currently the market for nanoparticle analysis instrumentation across the life sciences is $5.6 billion, and there are increasing concerns about nanoparticles in consumer products such as food and cosmetics, as well as in drinking water, effluents, and the environment. A major challenge in understanding the health impacts of nanoparticles is simply in accurately and easily detecting their presence and size distribution. Additionally, improved nanoparticle instrumentation will enable new discoveries in biotechnology and environmental and health sciences.

    This challenge can be met by developing a practical method for counting and sizing submicron particles in polydisperse mixtures. NSF Phase I/IB funds supported development of a prototype instrument that detects individual nanoparticles and accurately measures their size, at very high count rates. This instrument has successfully demonstrated robust detection of individual particles as small as 60 nm in diameter at rates approaching 10,000 particles per second, and has already begun to deliver useful information to particle manufacturers in the pharmaceutical industry, with on-going measurements of actual customer samples. The Phase II support will considerably enhance the utility of this instrument by addressing several outstanding technical challenges; most significantly, by extending the range of detectable particles to span the full range from 30 nm to 1000 nm, and by further maximizing the range of measurable particle concentrations.  In addition, the Phase II work will drive significant improvements in functionality and ease of use, driven by innovations in its control software. Finally, the instrument will be further validated using a wide variety of particle types relevant beyond the pharmaceutical space.

    no corrosion - which in turn permits a 30% reduction in concrete usage (and a
    corresponding 15 billion ton reduction in CO2 emissions) - and equivalent tensile
    strength at smaller diameters compared to steel rebar products.  FRP rebar is
    being produced but has limited market acceptance due to its high cost.  The high-speed
    process to be developed in this project will allow price parity when compared

    to current FRP manufacturing.  Combined, these improvements will allow entry to
    the $140 billion global market for steel rebar and allow mass market adoption
    of FRP rebar.  Additionally, basalt mine waste will be explored and, where possible,
    utilized as a raw material for fiber production.  The broader impact/commercial

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is development of a microbial technology for the conversion of low-value sugars into high-value chemicals. Most industrial chemicals produced today are derived from petroleum and other nonrenewable raw materials. The long-term growth and sustainability of the chemical industry benefits from development of new routes to existing chemicals using renewable raw materials. Furthermore, due to higher infrastructure costs and stricter environmental requirements, many chemicals that were once produced in the United States are now produced abroad. This contributes to the U.S. trade deficit. This Phase II proposal aims to develop a fermentation technology where domestically grown agricultural materials (for example, corn and waste agricultural residues) are converted into high-value chemicals. The optimized fermentation process is estimated to be cost-competitive with the incumbent petrochemical route when scaled. If successful, this proposal will facilitate growth of a domestic bio-chemical manufacturing industry, targeting the $30 billion organic acids market.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop large-scale, high-throughput techniques to optimize gene expression in industrial yeast. A significant problem within the field of industrial biotechnology is the ability to engineer and optimize the fermentation performance of non-academic or model microbes. Most molecular metabolic engineering tools are developed for use in two model prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbes, E. coli and S. cerevisiae, and are not suitable for use with industrially relevant microbes. Without these tools it is costly and slow to commercialize new fermentation technologies. The goal of this Phase II project is to develop and implement a set of molecular biology tools designed for acid-tolerant yeast, and working to apply them toward improving small molecule production. Specifically, the molecular biology tools are useful for tuning (up- or down-regulation) user-defined gene transcription and translation. Engineered microbes harboring the desired genetic modification(s) are assayed for improved small molecule production from sugar in small scale fermentations. Successful genetic modifications are those that result in more efficient small molecule product formation from sugar, and ideally decreased biomass formation from sugar, providing a lower production cost in a scaled, commercial process.

    Park that is capable of directly converting a wide range of feedstocks such as
    wheat straw, corn stover, and industrial by-products (e.g. molasses, glycerol)
    to valuable lipid products such as Omega-7 fatty acids and high-melting temperature
    waxes. Renewable oils, waxes and fatty acids have significant demand in a wide
    range of industries (e.g. neutraceuticals, biolubricants, cosmetics, candles and
    soaps). Consumers will clearly benefit from this technology through the reduction
    of our dependence on petroleum-based products while generating a market for agricultural
    wastes and by-products. Since few companies and research groups are investigating
    fungal lipid production directly from lignocellulosic biomass for higher- value
    products, both industry and the scientific community will benefit from the knowledge
    gained by this research. \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research Phase II
    project describes a simple, novel and cost-effective process for converting lignocellulosic
    and other waste feedstocks to high- value lipids using a microorganism isolated
    from Yellowstone National Park, which is capable of withstanding extreme acidic
    conditions and producing powerful enzymes for degrading cellulose, lignin and
    hemicellulose. The organism accumulates high concentrations of valuable lipids
    in a cost-effective ?one-step? process. The produced lipids based on renewable
    resources creates a market for waste agricultural materials. The primary objective
    of this SBIR project is to further develop the process for commercial production
    of lipid products from waste organic feedstocks. Phase II efforts will focus on
    optimizing the process with a bench pilot-scale system, performing process flow
    design and techno-economic analysis of commercial production systems, analyzing
    lipid products in detail, and targeting appropriate markets/customers for the
    produced lipid products. Coming out of the Phase II program, the goal is to have
    a pilot- level demonstration system designed to produce economically viable yields
    of high-value lipids from a variety of substrates for defined target markets and
    customers."

- abstractText: "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is aimed
    at optimizing production of a bio-surfactant in preparation for commercial launch
    of the product.  During Phase I, the company developed an engineered microorganism
    that synthesizes the surfactant, and a key customer confirmed the identity and
    purity of a sample of the surfactant.  During Phase II, synthetic biology methods
    will be used to increase the efficiency of the microorganism producing the surfactant.
    \ In addition, multiple samples of purified surfactant will be shipped to customers
    for evaluation.  Customer feedback will identify any product features that require
    modification and will result in development of a detailed product specification,
    which will include metrics such as:  purity, color, acceptable variation in composition
    and molecular weight, etc.  The objectives of this Phase II project are to optimize
    surfactant characteristics and microbial production efficiency so that the surfactant
    can be profitably manufactured and sold for use in consumer products formulations.\n
    \ \n\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project is that it should
    enable the company to demonstrate that synthetic biology methods can be used to
    increase the efficiency of production of a bio-surfactant so the surfactant can
    be sold as a commercial product.  Progress toward that goal should enable the
    company to attract a partner, for example a large chemical company, who will agree
    to collaborate on commercialization of the bio-surfactant.  If the bio-surfactant
    can be made and sold profitably, the company will be positioned to fund future
    research and development aimed at commercial launch of additional bio-surfactants.
    \ Benefits to society are that chemicals produced using this technology will be
    manufactured using domestically grown renewable raw materials, which do not compete
    with food.  Furthermore, the energy required to produce these chemicals is low
    since the fermentation reaction is performed near ambient temperature.  The chemicals
    are inherently safer than traditional chemicals because toxic solvents are not
    used, and the surfactants are biodegradable and do not contribute to increased
    greenhouse gas accumulation.  These bio-surfactants will initially be used in
    personal care products, such as body washes and shampoos.  However, the surfactant
    market is large and diverse, creating an opportunity for use of bio-surfactants
    in products as varied as laundry detergent, paints and coatings, and floatation-agents
    used in the mining industry to purify valuable minerals."

    Nanofiber Separations, LLC will establish an innovative type of bioseparation
    media utilizing electrospun nanofiber felts/mats of regenerated cellulose with
    high specific surface area as the support for protein adsorption ligands. Compared
    to competitive products (e.g., packed resin beads or microfiber adsorption membranes),
    these nanofiber membranes/felts will provide greatly enhanced throughput (i.e.,
    shorter processing times), reduce the amount of waste generated, and decrease
    the volume of media required (i.e., lower costs and smaller operating footprints)
    for purification of high-value biopharmaceutical products. The SBIR Phase I project
    was completed successfully by developing a manufacturing process for the functionalized
    nanofiber felts and proving superior performance compared to commercial products.
    This SBIR Phase II project will focus on further optimization of the formulations
    used during production of the nanofiber adsorbents for bioseparations. This will
    include two scale-up steps needed for the commercial manufacturing effort anticipated
    during the Phase II timeline (nanofiber felt production, surface functionalization,
    and module development). Key technical improvements, including greater product
    stability and a broader array of functional ligands needed in bioseparations,
    will continue to be made to the nanofiber felts/mats. \n\nThe broader impact/commercial
    potential of this project goes well beyond bioseparations. Due to the many advantages
    of the surface-functionalized electrospun nanofibers made from regenerated cellulose,
    this innovative adsorption material has tremendous commercial potential. Customers
    will come from companies within the biopharmaceutical industry, as well as from
    the established manufacturers of bioseparations adsorption media. Additionally,
    the underlying fundamentals associated with nanofiber adsorption media will have
    a wide range of implications, including more efficient separation processes in

    This SBIR Phase II project, the Engineering Design Instruction Software for implementing Objectives of Next generation standards (EDISON), will combine Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) concepts together with engineering design, simulation, Augmented Reality (AR), 3-D printing, and real-world experiments. The project will create a collaborative platform for middle school engineering projects where students create, analyze, simulate, and construct designs for several types of projects like bridges, cars, circuits, simple machines, drones, and robots. This project will provide positive experiences with STEM and engineering in middle school, when many students lose interest in these economically vital fields. EDISON will foster STEM engagement and inquiry in middle school, by leveraging gaming, team collaboration, 3D printing, and augmented reality. The project will create engineering experiences that connect math and science content directly to real world applications to improve student academic performance in traditional science and math subjects. This work has the potential to promote effective integration of engineering in K-12, prepare students for future careers, expand scientific literacy, and engage diverse groups of students in STEM, supporting NSF's mission.


    This SBIR Phase II project will produce a collaborative engineering design platform for middle school, containing realistic design tools, content creation, embedded standards-based STEM assessment, and tools supporting prototyping and testing. EDISON provides end to end solutions for team-based engineering in middle schools and maintains engagement through gamification. This project will develop sophisticated tools that are lacking in existing engineering curricula, and support math and science standards alignment using model-based engineering, virtual design collaboration, and embedded tools for student evaluation. In this work the Phase I prototype will be extended by developing reusable design modules for circuit design, simple machines, aerodynamics, and programming. Testing tools using sensors and Augmented Reality will be added for real world data collection and analysis. Numerous modular standards aligned lessons and a content creation interface to facilitate EDISON?s transition to an instructional platform will be created. Finally, in collaboration with our University partner EDISON will be extensively tested and student outcomes evaluated in 6th, 7th, and 8th grade classrooms using a combination of embedded, quantitative, and qualitative methods. The goal is to better meet the STEM instructional needs of educators and students with superior capabilities, engaging experiences, and easy to use tools.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is focused on the development of a lithium metal battery using a novel Liquefied Gas Electrolyte. While there is an intense global effort to advance electrolyte chemistry for next-generation lithium batteries, these efforts focus almost entirely on liquid and solid-state electrolytes. In contrast, this project aims to further develop the use of a novel class of electrolytes which use solvents that are typically gaseous at room temperature and liquefied under moderate pressures. Phase I work demonstrated world-record cycling lithium metal with an average plating/stripping coulombic efficiency of >99.5% over 400 cycles with (0.5 mA/cm2 and 0.5 mAh/cm2 each cycle) with smooth and highly dense lithium deposition as observed through cryogenic focused-ion-beam characterization. Further, a world-record low temperature electrolytic conductivity of 3 mS/cm at -80 ?C for lithium-based electrolytes was obtained, far exceeding the state-of-art. Lastly, a reversible high temperature shut-down at +40 ?C, due to a decrease in electrolyte conductivity from salt precipitation, was demonstrated. This high temperature shut-down essentially eliminates thermal runaway reaction from occurring, making for a significantly safer battery.

    Further development of these electrolytes through this NSF Phase II grant will enable further work to increase battery specific energy to 450 Wh/kg, expand operating temperatures from -60 to +60 ?C, and increased safety with no thermal runaway while maintaining power and cycle life comparable to conventional Li-ion. This will be accomplished with further development of the electrolyte chemistry to improve lithium metal coulombic efficiency to >99.8% over 1000 cycles, increase the high temperature shut-down to +60~70 ?C, increasing cathode performance to higher voltages and cycle life, and the development of a high throughput R&D line which will offer high precision addition of electrolyte components to fine tune the chemistry. Because the electrolyte chemistry may use several common materials and manufacturing methods, there should be low cost barrier to entry and it is expected there will be significant cost reduction in volume production down to the goal of $100/kWh. The developed technology will be especially well suited for low temperature applications such as high-atmosphere, defense, and aerospace which frequently endure extreme temperatures and require high specific energy. Because of the superior performance at low temperatures compared to the incumbent, South 8 Technologies will first focus on developing the technology in these areas. As the technology matures, an eventual move into grid storage and transportation markets will follow, leading to a substantial decrease in emissions and reliance on imported fuels. The underlying fundamental chemistry with these new materials is a relatively new field and may potentially lead to significant advances in next-generation energy storage devices and broader technologies, leading to new industries, job growth and beyond.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is to enable organizations - whether businesses, governments, or non-profits - to make more informed, more data-driven decisions. All organizations must decide how to allocate limited resources and do so in the context of meeting a set of objectives, such as profit, social wellbeing, or health. Modeling as a process and models as artifacts of that process allow decision makers to understand data through the lens of objectives and to then make decisions; data alone, no matter how much, cannot make decisions. As more aspects of the world are instrumented and captured digitally, the breadth and quantity of data will out of necessity require larger, more complex models to be built. Organizations will need a modeling workflow and supporting tools that scale with these demands.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the challenge of many users collaboratively building and maintaining analytical models that are consistent and reproducible while allowing for divergent and convergent change. This project will address the resource management challenges identified in development and the interactivity gaps identified in user testing of the Phase I prototype. The result will be a commercial software application for building models that manages code, data, and the evolution of both over time by many users.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project centers on bringing enhanced independence, productivity, and quality of life for hundreds of thousands of individuals in the US who live with severe physical disability due to spinal cord injury or other debilitating neurodegenerative disorders, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Due to improvements in emergency medicine and increasing average age, these individuals represent a growing population that is underserved by current assistive technologies (ATs). The ATs being relied upon to carry out basic tasks are still primitive, offer limited versatility, and fail to meet end-user needs. Meanwhile, computers and internet play ever-growing roles in everyday life and are regarded as equalizers that allow individuals to have similar vocational, recreational, and educational opportunities. The Tongue Drive System (TDS) offers individuals with severe physical disabilities an intuitive and superior mechanism for accessing computer-based resources, wheelchairs, smartphones, smart homes, etc. TDS harnesses the power of the human tongue, which often retains full capability in these individuals despite losses of other functions, to drive human-computer interactions. TDS has the potential to revolutionize the current AT market in the US and around the world with an anticipated market size of $1B within its primary market segment.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase-II project aims to bring this transformative and game-changing AT to market by continuing the design, development, evaluation, and expansion of a robust, reliable, and real-time TDS ecosystem. In Phase-I, the TDS hardware was redesigned and consolidated so that all signal processing functions were self-contained into a new standalone TDS (sTDS) headset system with a dual-band wireless link that can directly interface with a target peripheral by transmitting formatted user-defined commands. In Phase-II the designs for a solid and intuitive user interface, a smartphone app, and a robust and rugged powered wheelchair interface module to effectively control key target devices will be fine-tuned in the final stages of development in preparation for launch. The sTDS hardware/software/enclosure will also be tested and ready for manufacturing and meet the FDA regulatory requirements towards submission of a 510(k) premarket notification.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the creation of a new tool that could prevent the loss of sensitive data stored in big data management systems due to cyber-attacks. Furthermore, the proposed cybersecurity tool can allow organizations to audit their big data usage to prevent data misuse and comply with various privacy regulations. Recent attacks have shown that the leakage/stealing of stored data may result in enormous monetary loss and damage to organizational reputation, and increased identity theft risks for individuals. Furthermore, in the age of big data, protecting the security and privacy of stored data is paramount for maintaining public trust, and getting the full value from the collected data. The company's proposed tool will potentially have significant impact by addressing these important societal needs with respect to big data security and privacy. Based on customer discovery findings, this tool will also address an important customer need found in many different industries and has the potential to have significant commercial impact as more and more companies are adopting big data technologies.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will commercialize a novel big data privacy, security and governance management tool that provides efficient data sanitization, attribute-based access control, accountability and governance policy enforcement capabilities for protecting sensitive data stored in big data management systems. In addition, the proposed product will provide novel data sensitivity aware intrusion detection capabilities. The Phase II research objectives are: 1) to develop an efficient attribute-based access control framework to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data; 2) to develop data sanitization capabilities for complying with various regulations; 3) to develop a scalable audit log capture, storage and querying framework for increasing accountability for big data usage; and 4) to develop a data sensitivity aware intrusion detection framework to quickly detect potential attacks against sensitive data. These objectives pose significant research challenges with respect to scaling to big data without impacting the existing workflow of the companies. The company proposes to address these challenges by using novel code injection techniques combined with risk aware audit log generation and data sensitivity aware machine learning based intrusion detection techniques.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to search and understand documents across domains. It is a powerful tool for consumers and businesses to route, categorize and ensure key points of a document are seen. This makes it easy for overwhelmed users to search, link topic information to knowledge bases and extract customized data, even if they can't think of the right keywords.  Online search can infer the popularity or relevance of a page based on data from millions of users, including a user's location and what they've shown interest in; however, business users don't benefit from these features. Users view concepts in a summary linked to a knowledge base, allowing them to see summaries, triage documents on mobile devices, write rules to sort or filter them automatically, and see key data before ever opening the document.  This Phase II project improves information extraction systems by generating answerboxes from complex documents. Consumers will be able to quickly get the gist of formal documents such as consumer credit contracts, insurance policies, industry solicitations, engineering and other difficult-to-read documents. This innovation advances knowledge discovery, information retrieval methods, information extraction, slot-filling, and knowledge-base population.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II Project discovers unsupervised and unrestricted slots and fillers (attributes and values) to construct structured summaries based on keywords and underlying patterns in document collections. It extends the state of the art by not requiring a manually crafted catalogue of slots and complements supervised approaches by discovering new slots. While conventional Natural Language Processing (NLP) approaches are effective on well-formed sentences, the techniques described here are effective for semi-structured content such as section headers, lists and tables. Additionally, NLP based approaches for fact extraction and text summarization are primarily lexical, requiring further processing for disambiguating and linking to unique entities and concepts in a knowledge base. This approach further advances the state of the art by eliminating these steps as it identifies keywords and links to knowledge base concepts as a first step in the discovery process. This concept-linking enables terms to explicitly map to semantic concepts in other ontologies such that they are available to enable reasoning and understanding.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will enable Unmanned Aerial Systems
    (UAS or drones) to safely and reliably operate from moving vehicles and moving vessels at sea.
    There is an immediate need for this capability in many industries. In commercial fishing, drones
    will replace manned aircraft for fish-finding operations, radically reducing cost and risk. In maritime
    security, drones will provide surveillance around ships, including locating a ?man-overboard? in
    time to save the person?s life. In the oil and gas industry, drones will provide rapid-response to oil
    spills by mapping the location and extent of the oil slick, limiting the environmental and economic
    damage. In hydrographic surveying, drones will identify and geo-locate navigation aids, at a
    fraction of the time and cost of current survey methods. In commercial shipping, drones will
    inspect and protect shipping vessels while they are underway. In the transport industry, drones
    will delivery packages the ?last mile? from a delivery truck to a customer?s door. In law enforcement
    and border security, drones will operate from moving patrol vehicles while officers remain safe
    and mobile in the vehicle. These applications are currently difficult or impossible, but will become
    radically safer and easier with the proposed technology.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project will advance the current state
    of the art in UAS/drone autonomy, to enable reliable drone operations from moving vehicles and
    moving vessels at sea. Shipboard landing is extremely difficult, due to the heaving and rolling of
    the ship deck, potential high winds, and the high precision control required during landing. Current
    drone technology does not facilitate landing on moving platforms; this prevents their use in
    maritime operations, and has become the main barrier to commercialization in this sector. The
    proposed research will develop a vision-aided relative navigation system that combines precise
    air-to-ship observations with onboard sensor measurements to accurately estimate the relative
    state between the drone and the ship. These relative state estimates will be used to dynamically
    route and control the drone safely on to the ship deck. Technical feasibility of this approach has
    been demonstrated during the Phase I project, which included demonstration of the technology
    in a relevant environment. The primary goals of the Phase 2 project are to improve system
    reliability, expand the operational envelope, and productize our system. The plan to achieve these
    goals includes scientific development paired with extensive testing, validation, and demonstration.

    This SBIR Phase II project addresses low student engagement through a dynamic video delivery environment with a novel, real-time algorithm that adjusts the instructional pathway to each student's readiness level. According to research, the greatest challenge facing teachers is overcoming the fact that between 25-66% of students are disengaged. Adapting instruction to each student's learning background has long been touted as the most effective method to drive student engagement; when instruction is individualized, engagement and outcomes increase dramatically. By calibrating video segments to student readiness, this project delivers appropriately challenging instruction to most effectively sustain engagement. Building on promising results in Phase I, the project aims to improve engagement and outcomes for all Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) students and, most pointedly, impacts English Language Learners (ELL) who often fall behind in STEM classes because instruction is beyond their readiness and in-class support is insufficient. Considering that ELL population is the fastest-growing population of public school students in the United States, this project has a significant potential to drive a STEM proficient workforce. Furthermore, given a strong, pre-existing client base, the project team is well positioned to penetrate the $110 million immediately addressable market. By 2020, the project team expects to be changing how 10% of U.S. middle schoolers absorb STEM instruction, opening a pathway to the adoption of powerful blended classroom techniques that enhance engagement, improve learning, and promote STEM careers.



    The core innovation is a research-founded algorithm to deliver appropriately complex instruction through all video segments. For successful delivery of appropriately complex instructional video segments, the project (1) measures student complexity readiness, (2) maintains a database of video segments categorized by complexity (using factors such as syntactic and lexical complexity), and (3) uniquely unifies that information to identify a real-time next step for that student (which video segment should be shown). The aim is to enhance outcomes by providing each student an appropriately complex instructional pathway forward. With roots in the leading interactive video solution, this project is made possible through access to a large database of tagged and curated videos (hundreds of thousands) and questions (millions) and provides an unprecedented opportunity to develop adaptive instructional pathways for a diverse learning spectrum. For Phase II, the project team's goal is to deploy a fully functioning classroom prototype of a product built around a middle school Physical Science unit and measure impact on engagement and learning. The team will employ stimulated recall interviewing techniques, speak aloud interview protocols, and quantitative usage logs to assess the feasibility of highly-adaptive video instruction to increase student engagement. Evaluation will include both formative components (to gauge implementation and iterative improvement) as well as summative components to assess impact on engagement and learning outcomes in a mixed-methods design including multiple pilot studies with control and experiment groups.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop a manufacturing platform for opioid
    medicines. Opioids enable physicians to provide compassionate care to patients
    suffering from acute or chronic disease and trauma. The need for opioid analgesics
    is even more salient for surgeons anticipating the post-operative recovery of
    their patients and planning for end-of-life care. However, opioids are highly
    addictive medicines, a property that has been exploited for commercial gain by
    certain players in the pharmaceutical industry. The impact of this project will
    be to deliver a technology that transforms the existing supply chain for opioids
    by removing the need to grow opium poppy as a drug crop. Instead of sourcing poppy
    materials from poppy-growing countries, this new technology will allow for complete
    production of opioids in a secure industrial facility located in the United States
    where federal agencies can provide oversight and regulation. Additionally, investment
    in this technology will enable the development of many more existing and experimental
    medicines derived from plants, including greatly improved opioids with improved
    efficacy and safety, and cardiovascular and chemotherapeutic therapies that will
    extend and enhance human lives.   \n\nThis SBIR Phase II project will develop
    a bioprocess for opioid active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). To date, the
    only commercially-competitive method for manufacturing opioids and related alkaloids
    is to extract these molecules from plants. However, Baker's yeast was recently
    engineered to biosynthesize opioids, which is a technological advance that could
    enable opioid production by fermentation. However, many technical hurdles remain
    in developing a reliable and cost-effective, commercially-viable production system
    based on existing strains. The objective of this Phase II project is to provide
    a complete demonstration and pilot-scale operation of an API bioprocess that is
    ready for industrial scale up. The research employs four approaches: 1) Further
    development of the engineered yeast strains, 2) scale up of fermentation from
    laboratory scale to pilot scale, 3) optimization of downstream recovery and purification,
    and 4) evaluation of the resulting products to establish their validity as drop-in-replacements
    for existing opioid APIs. The outcome will be a process validated at pilot scale
    and ready for technology transfer to a secure industrial facility that will make
    and sell into the opioids API market. This research will replace opium poppies
    with a modern bioprocess that resembles established, standardized pharmaceutical
    industry methods for antibiotic and biologic APIs.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's
    statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
    the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is aimed to develop and commercialize an extendable/retractable telescopic structural wall for flood protection. This technology will enable more resilient infrastructure in flood-prone areas.  Coastal cities and riverine communities are vulnerable to flooding hazards. These population centers tend to be located near bodies of water, and finding the space to accommodate increasing populations, as well as hazard-resilient infrastructure, represents a challenge for city officials and the engineering community in general.  The commercial opportunity of the technology lies on the increasing worldwide need for flood protection. In fact, the World Bank estimates that 50 billion dollars a year will be spent worldwide in measures to mitigate this hazard. In U.S. only, floods are considered one of the costliest and deadliest natural hazards with an estimated 7.9 billion dollars in damages and 82 fatalities per year. This technology, when developed, will provide a paradigm shift for the prefabricated concrete industry. It will also develop and validate new methods for telescopic interconnection of structural elements.

    The intellectual merit of this project lies in a unique concept where structural boxes, made out of fiber reinforced concrete, can be deployed telescopically to withstand forces imposed from external sources, and then return to a retracted position. In Phase I, the feasibility of the concept was demonstrated by the ability of specimens to withstand the forces from three flooding scenarios representative of the targeted market sector: riverine, storm-surges and tsunamis. The Phase II project will focus on assessing the technical features of the walls based on lead-off customer sites. These will include the height of the walls, type of soil, and the hazard assessment, among others technical factors. Studies will be conducted on the local and overall structural response of the walls and the functionality of their mechanical components. Analytical and numerical models will be built and validated with tests on specific components and on full-scale models. The full-scale specimens will be subjected to storm-surges, hurricane, tsunami, slow-rising waters, and impacting debris forces. Robust theoretical framework along with analytical and numerical models and design guidelines will be built to reliably scale and replicate the technology for virtually any site where flood protection is needed.

- abstractText: "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project uses
    a new class of chemosensor films to continuously measure the concentration of
    heavy metals in a flowing stream of industrial wastewater. This will make it possible
    to know the concentration of several heavy metals at any given time so that treatment
    chemicals used to remove those metals can be metered precisely.  Current treatment
    methods typically rely on infrequent sampling of wastewater streams and time-delayed,
    labor-intensive laboratory measurements. Without the ability to measure continuously,
    wastewater treatment is adjusted based on periodic averages and estimated peak
    discharges.  To reduce the risk of regulatory violation, most wastewater treatment
    systems use twice the volume of treatment chemicals than might otherwise be needed.
    \ With the ability to measure metal concentrations continuously and automatically,
    wastewater treatment can be controlled in real time, cutting treatment chemical
    costs, solid waste costs and measurement labor costs by more than 50%.  Continuous
    measurement also reduces the risk of regulatory violations by > 90%, in turn reducing
    the potential costs of remediation and compliance as well as improving environmental
    conditions for the general public.     \n\nThe key outcome of Phase I research
    was the successful development of 15 new chemosensors permanently bound to a substrate,
    each with a unique response to zinc, cadmium, cobalt, chromium, lead, copper,
    iron, magnesium, manganese, mercury, nickel and tin. In Phase II, responses from
    an array of chemosensors will be fully characterized with a prototype instrument
    developed for commercial use in different industrial environments.  With that
    instrument, a mathematical model will be constructed to accurately convert sensor
    responses into scientific units of measure for multiple dissolved metals. The
    lower limit of detection for existing sensors ranges from 5 ppb to 50 ppb.  In
    parallel with analytical modeling work, chemosensor synthesis work continues to
    lower the limit of detection to 1 ppb, extend sensor life beyond 6 months, and
    broaden the portfolio of sensors to improve metal selectivity.  In the future,
    this new class of bonded chemosensors may be extended to determine the concentration
    of phosphates and many other species that are currently sampled occasionally and
    measured with lab instruments.  For applications where continuous measurement
    is important, this unique family of chemosensors offers great potential for real-time
    process control in a variety of industrial applications."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is that it addresses the bandwidth crisis, the problem of transmitting an exponentially growing amount of data through a fixed amount of increasingly congested spectrum. The bandwidth crisis limits economic growth by constraining communication, and also poses very serious challenges for national defense and disaster response. Making better use of limited spectrum is therefore of high societal and commercial importance. This project will study a new approach, called spiral modulation, for achieving much more spectrally efficient communication than previously thought possible and thereby directly addressing the bandwidth crisis. Commercially, this could facilitate much more rapid data transfer, enhancing existing business applications and enabling new ones. Spiral modulation is applicable to any form of electromagnetic communication, whether wireless or wire-based. It could lead to commercialization across a wide range of communication sectors including but not limited to wireless, mobile internet, unmanned vehicles, automotive, aviation, and Internet of Things. It is a dual use technology with both civilian and defense applications. Ultimately, spiral modulation could become the core technology for the worldwide telecommunications industry.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project applies new mathematics to the problem of encoding information into waveforms for telecommunication. In current digital communication, information is transmitted using symbol waveforms constructed from sinusoids which have constant amplitude over each symbol period. This approach is known to produce a sharp upper bound on the highest spectral efficiency that can be achieved. By instead constructing symbol waveforms from sinusoidal waveforms with continuously-varying amplitude, spiral modulation bypasses the theoretical limitation on spectral efficiency. Building on prior Phase I research, this project will build an end-to-end hardware prototype to establish the implementation path and performance characteristics of spiral modulation. The research will progress in stages from waveform design and spectral efficiency measurement experiments, through end-to-end radio design in software, the hardware prototype development and documentation of best practices. It is anticipated that this research will show significant spectral efficiency advantages over existing signal modulation techniques. Other possible advantages for spiral modulation may also appear, such as greater tolerance for interference and phase distortion.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project relates to the
    development of non-pharmacological interventions capable of improving clinical
    outcomes following spinal fusion surgery. Between 1998 and 2008, the annual
    number of spinal fusion surgeries increased 137% from 174,223 to 413,171 and the
    national bill for spinal fusion increased 7.9-fold. The greatest risk in spinal fusion
    procedures is failure to fuse, which can be particularly troublesome in high risk
    patients. Failure to fuse leads to poor surgical outcomes for patients and may result in
    chronic pain, secondary surgical procedures, reduced productivity, and/or permanent
    disability. In addition, failure to fuse results in greater clinical burden for physicians
    and increased cost per patient for payers. Lumbar fusions, in particular, have a
    cumulative reoperation rate of 19% over the 11 years following the initial procedure
    (BCC Research, 2010). The present project could result in the identification of new
    surgical devices and techniques capable of improving surgical outcomes, reducing
    complications, and eliminating costs associated with unsuccessful surgery. Osteogenic
    surgical device and techniques developed in the present project may also be used to
    accelerate bone healing and improve clinical outcomes following fractures of the skull,
    face, and long bones.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project is to
    demonstrate in an animal model that osteogenic spinal instrumentation accelerates
    new bone formation and improves the rate of posterolateral fusion compared to
    clinically-accepted best practices in spinal fusion surgery. Innovative osteogenic spinal
    instrumentation (pedicle screws, rods, etc.) facilitates both mechanical stabilization of
    the spine and focused delivery of fusion-stimulating direct electric current (DC) at the
    fusion site. Application of therapeutic stimuli via selectively anodized pedicle screws
    accelerates the rate at which new bone is formed in critical regions of the spine such
    as the zygapophyseal joint and lateral gutter. The propensity of newly formed bone to
    create a robust, biomechanically sound fusion of adjacent vertebrae is also increased
    under osteogenic stimulation. Phase I results demonstrate that selectively-anodized
    electroactive pedicle screws effectively deliver focused osteogenic stimuli to key
    regions of the lumbar spine critical to spinal fusion. Results provide computational
    evidence for the technological and clinical success of novel osteogenic
    instrumentation in spinal fusion surgery. Phase II will confirm that the system of
    electroactive spinal instrumentation has the potential to accelerate bone growth and
    improve post-surgical fusion outcomes compared to gold-standard interventions
    utilizing a clinically relevant large animal model.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase II project stems from addressing the problem of embedded energy in the manufacture of magnesium metal for use in vehicle light-weighting. Improving fuel economy by incorporation of the lightest structural metal, magnesium, does not save on total lifecycle energy consumed if the magnesium was produced using conventional methods. The most energy efficient and economical production method is known is a process technology that was commercially viable during World War II but not at any other time in history. The project innovation reinvestigates and reinvents this dated process, discovering the reasons for technical and economic failure. Domestic magnesium production using state-of-the-art energy-efficient practices will lead to opportunity and growth for downstream manufacturers that support a wide range of military, industrial, and consumer products such as car parts, electronic devices, titanium and steel production, and canned beverages. The economic and environmental benefits of the innovation in the long term will be ever more prescient given the unprecedented rise in use of magnesium metal over the past 100 years. This innovation creates a clean and economic route to magnesium production, helping to reinvigorate light metals industries within the U.S.

    The intellectual merit of this project is derived from a new paradigm in the condensation of magnesium metal gas produced by carbothermal reduction of magnesium oxide. Previously, shock cooling through a meta-stable temperature range was employed, generating pyrophoric powders that are dangerous and difficult to handle. This Phase II research uses both rapid cooling and controlled heterogeneous condensation for the formation of robust, oxidation resistance magnesium condensate. This process is executed in a novel and continuous condenser for high metal throughput. This effort is also made possible through the development of a reduction reactor technology that operates under milder conditions than previously used while maintaining high production rates. Total plant energy consumption will be at least 50% less than the dominant incumbent process. The Phase II project will result in a scaled ore-to-ingot pilot facility for the manufacture of magnesium metal as a raw material into manufacturing processes. Product quality, process feasibility, and proven scale-up will be demonstrated.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project stems from technology for automatic network configuration analysis.  As ever more devices connect to the Internet and rich services move to the "cloud," both the complexity of computer networks and their reliability requirements are rapidly escalating. It is no wonder that network outages and security breaches are common.  Yet another side effect of this complexity, which does not make the headlines but is equally damaging, is that network engineers are understandably fearful of making configuration changes, so networks are unable to evolve at a speed that keeps up with changing business needs.  The technology developed in this project will enable network engineers to validate correctness, security, and performance properties of their networks proactively, before errors reach the running network.  This technology has the potential to improve the robustness of critical network infrastructure that is widely relied upon, to prevent unauthorized access to resources, and to increase the pace of innovation.  The project will also provide insights into the largest "pain points" in modern networks and develop design and analysis techniques to address them.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project further develops the Batfish network configuration analysis technology.  Interactions with pilot customers as well as many interviews with potential customers identified the needs of the marketplace and how the Batfish technology can best be adapted to meet those needs. As a result, the specific goal of this project is to seamlessly aid network engineers in validating network behavior during the policy design phase. Drawing inspiration from how software is developed today, the company will extend Batfish to support continuous integration of network configurations and develop a series of analyses that can find errors in network configurations with minimal input from the network engineers. The anticipated outcome of these research thrusts is a technology that allows network engineers to easily understand and gain confidence in their proposed network designs and to iterate these designs more quickly.   The project will be driven by continued interactions with several pilot customers.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the healthcare needs of the 27 million Americans and 300 million patients globally suffering with type 2 diabetes (T2D). These patients are desperate for a safe treatment that reestablishes glycemic control to augment or replace current management strategies such as metformin and insulin, which only slow the progression of the disease. This proposal provides a unique approach to T2D based on an orally delivered intestinal coating that mimics the beneficial metabolic effects of bariatric surgery. The potential commercial impact of this novel treatment is highly significant as the total estimated cost of diabetes management in the US is upwards of $245 billion, and rising. Overall, an astounding 1 in 5 US health care dollars is used for the care of people with diabetes. Therefore, major insurers are very interested in the reimbursement of alternative approaches for treating T2D, thereby lessening the national cost burden.

    The proposed project supports the further development of an entirely novel treatment for T2D based on new insights from bariatric surgery. The medical community has recently recognized that certain bariatric procedures involving duodenal exclusion confer profound and immediate benefits in glucose tolerance. Sleeve-type medical devices have provided clinical validation for this approach, but such devices are invasive and not currently approved due to safety issues. The investigators propose a non-invasive and safe orally-delivered intestinal coating which is expected to provide the same effect as surgery and implanted sleeves, but requires neither a specialist nor sedation. This proposal describes in-vitro and in-vivo experiments that build on positive results of the Phase I project, and drive the company towards human clinical trials. Specific Aim-1 is to optimize the active lead compound through evaluation of a limited number of rational structural variations. Specific Aim 2 is to demonstrate the dose-dependent efficacy and safety of lead formulations in a chronic diabetic animal model. Consultation with leading endocrinologists, gastroenterologists, and material scientists has guided the selection of the materials and methods of this proposal. Completion of the studies outlined in the NSF SBIR Phase II proposal will accelerate clinical translation, bringing this novel treatment closer to patients in need.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II is to reduce the patient harm and financial burden created
    by the intensifying problem of emergency department (ED) crowding.  ED crowding
    is a threat to patient safety for high acuity patients and has been associated
    with avoidable morbidity and mortality across many conditions.  Concurrently,
    EDs are challenged to efficiently manage large volumes of low-acuity patients
    visiting with non-emergency conditions. The proposed electronic health record
    (EHR) integrated technology deploys novel machine learning algorithms that predict
    clinical events at actionable time-points in patients care pathways.  Characterizing
    the ED as a flow system, these decision support tools will concentrate on the
    root causes that exist at ED inflow and hospital outflow. This new foresight is
    expected to enable innovative hospital operational models that expedite patient
    progression (minimize patient waiting), improve patient safety, and directly translate
    to measurable cost-savings and/or revenue generation. The SBIR Phase II project
    should result in higher yield and scalable decision support technology while promoting
    the value of data-enabled science and engineering in healthcare. \n\n \n\nThe
    proposed project objective is to greatly reduce ED crowding by advancing the data-science,
    decision-science, and operations research that underpins our decision support
    technology. This new technology is based upon a novel combination of data normalization,
    feature selection, and supervised machine learning methods to predict clinical
    events that drives clear action to optimize hospital resources.  This includes
    a decision support tool that functions at ED triage (inflow) to predict risk of
    critical events to empower safe separation of service streams for acutely ill
    and non-urgent patients. A complementary tool functions near hospital discharge
    (outflow) to predict expected discharge time enabling hospital-wide prioritization
    of resources required to expedite discharge. This unlocks downstream capacity
    and removes a major ED outflow bottleneck that creates prolonged waiting. The
    proposed technology is innovative by design to be scaled, yet adaptive to hospitals
    individual patient populations, operational objectives, and risk tolerances. The
    technology is expected to further advance learning with providers about how to
    consume new predictive and explanatory information for decision support.  The
    specific Phase II objectives are to continue the development of the technology
    by: (1) integrating feedback into prediction output, (2) developing performance
    monitoring capabilities, and (3) driving systems-based management of patient progression."

    images. The deep learning-based software being developed will allow consumers
    to find products they are interested in, and co-purchase related products, quickly.
    Further, users will be more engaged through exposure to designer photographs of
    products (inspirational photography). By helping customers find exactly what they
    are looking for in a timely manner, user engagement and productivity will be increased.
    Further, related style-based recommendations will increase purchasing overall.
    \ Increased spending stimulates economic growth by increasing taxable revenue
    by retailers, and through increased sales taxes generated from the purchases.
    \n\nThis Small Business Innovative Research Phase II project seeks to develop
    a visual search engine that is poised to disrupt retail and ecommerce by switching
    the focus from text-based to visual search-based exploration. The platform initially
    targets interior décor and furniture where deep learning techniques are trained
    to recognize products across a wide range of conditions. In Phase II, the software
    deep learning architectures will be generalized to enable a broader range of products,
    and to allow customers more control over design decisions and choices. A client-facing
    REST API will allow retailers, designers, and media companies to programmatically
    access functionality of the platform, and build their own user interfaces and
    apps on top of the deep learning technology. Lastly, it is proposed to develop
    a white-label app that can be customized for individual retailers who want to
    distribute this visual search capability to their customers.  Achieving these
    objectives will create state-of-the-art performance in visual search for applications
    in interior design, apparel search, real estate search, and product look-up."

    The broader impact and commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer and Research (STTR) project is a method to control invasive or otherwise unwanted trees and shrubs in an ecologically friendly manner with a biodegradable product. This will reduce the quantity of synthetic herbicides and/or synthetic herbicide adjuvants currently applied to control woody plants. This is especially needed near waterways where vegetation managers must choose between expensive mechanical removal or potential harm to sensitive ecosystems. Homeowners, landscapers, farmers, conservationists, utilities, and other customers will have a new product to control invasive trees and shrubs consistent with a mission to be good stewards of the environment.

    This STTR Phase II project proposes to follow initial successful Phase I demonstrations of an enzymatic bio-herbicide or herbicide adjuvant following the principles of termite biomimicry. The objectives of this Phase II project are to identify the mode-of-action, develop high- and medium-throughput bioassays in vitro and in planta, optimize the product formulation, and demonstrate efficacy on various invasive species in the field such as bush honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii), tree of heaven (Ailanthus altissima), glossy buckthorn (Frangula alnus), bamboo (Phyllostachys aurea), and potentially others.

    develop a resonant light detection and ranging (R-LIDAR) distance sensor based
    upon use of an optomechanical beam scanning element actuated at resonant frequency.
    The broader impact of this project is to commercialize distance sensing instrumentation
    that advances the development of robotic and autonomous systems (RAS) by providing
    improved performance and order-of-magnitudes reduction in sensor size and cost.
    The development of RAS technologies could benefit society by increasing the productivity
    of economic activities in industries that include: mining, oil and gas, transportation,
    manufacturing, construction, agriculture, forestry, and defense. These industries
    are commercially significant and accounted for 24% of US GDP in 2015. Upon development,
    the R-LIDAR system is expected to make a commercial impact in a total addressable
    market for light detection and ranging (LIDAR) distance sensors that is expected
    to reach $739 million/year by 2018. Successful development of the R-LIDAR instrument
    will also pioneer opportunities for resonant scanning instrumentation in related
    optical applications that include microscopy, endoscopy, light machining, and
    display.\n \nResonant beam scanners provide robust high-speed and high-performance
    operation that address size, weight, and power (SWAP) consumption limitations
    in state of the art light LIDAR distance sensors. The key outcome of the SBIR
    Phase I project was the successful integration of a resonant optomechanical element
    into an R-LIDAR distance sensor, demonstrating a 125 X 125 pixel field-of-view
    acquired at a 20 Hz frame rate. The SBIR Phase II project seeks to advance R-LIDAR
    instrumentation through (1) development of low-SWAP robust scanning elements,
    (2) techniques and instrumentation that allow for improved signal to noise ratio
    and high-rate data acquisition from pulsed time-of-flight LIDAR sensors, and (3)
    increased ranging capability of low-SWAP R-LIDAR instrumentation. Successful completion
    of these technical objectives will result in a distance sensing technology that
    will be particularly useful for high-accuracy surveying and inspection applications
    conducted using small unmanned aircraft system (S-UAS), where size and payload
    constraints are acute."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project stems from a potential reduction in the capital cost of wind turbines by an astounding 15x. The Company's patented, remarkably simple design also reduces transportation, maintenance, and land costs, and provides greater location and altitude flexibility. It uses the same aerodynamics as today's dominant wind technology, the horizontal axis wind turbine (HAWT), but with innovations that build on recent research into airborne wind energy generation. Multiple, 6-meter airfoils (they look like model airplanes) behave exactly like the outer tips of a conventional wind turbine blade, which is where most of the power is generated in a HAWT. The airfoils run along a rail- as if one captured kites and put them on short leashes - and a linear generator makes the power. The proposed research is a continuation of SBIR Phase I research and development that had demonstrated that these principles are scientifically sound. If successful, this Phase II project would drastically reduce the cost of wind-generated electricity, making it competitive with fossil fuels. It would thus be a completely self-sustaining commercially viable entity, creating jobs and generating tax revenues. By out-competing fossil fuels, it would use market forces to encourage renewable energy development, thus reducing energy-related emissions and improving national health, prosperity, and welfare. The project's light weight, low profile, and easy, flexible set-up may also have military and emergency applications that would help secure the national defense.



    The proposed technology captures energy through translational rather than rotational motion in the tips of the airfoils as they run along a rail tethered by bridles. Its major innovation is a patented bridling system that handles downwind forces (aerodynamic tip-over forces), which are the primary cause of the HAWT's mass and cost. Another major innovation is to run airfoils in an oval rather than a circle. This alters the math behind swept area, the key input for generation capacity. Because the oval's swept area is a function of length and height, rather than radius squared, this project can add capacity in many different ways, escaping the tyranny of building ever-bigger and -taller circles. The first objective is to design, test, build, measure, and refine a 100 kilowatt (kW) device. A meaningful-scale second-generation device will demonstrate the project's ability to meet performance, weight, and cost targets, while facilitating decisions about how to build far larger devices, and modeling their costs. The methods and approaches will continue to conquer challenges in five subsystems: structures, aerodynamics, power generation, control, and grid integration. The team, which includes leading experts in both academia and industry, will design subsystem options. It will convene to find the best system-wide design and construct the device, with many refinements along the way.

    scale-up development of eco-friendly, cost-effective novel Electroless Nickel
    Immersion Gold (ENIG) surface finish with high corrosion resistance and robust
    solder joints for better reliability of electronic assemblies. Conventional ENIG
    currently available in the market is prone to black-pad defects (hyper-corrosion
    related failures) associated with de-wetting of solder. ENIG also suffers from
    brittle solder joint failures. Due to these reasons, there are field failures
    and reliability concerns of electronic assemblies - component disconnection which
    lead to overall malfunction of electronic assemblies. Moreover, most ENIG manufacturers/suppliers
    provide cyanide-based gold chemistry which has health and ecological hazards.
    The novel ENIG eliminates black pads- corrosion related issues, achieves robust
    solder joints and provides improved quality and reliability of electronic assembly.
    Also, it uses cyanide-free chemistry for immersion gold process making it eco-friendly.
    This allows manufacturers to consume eco-friendly product while avoiding major
    field failures and resulting consequences. This new technology would be potential
    replacement for existing ENIG (with market value roughly about 2-3 billion USD/year).
    \n\nThe primary focus of the project is to eliminate black-pad related failures
    and lead to robust, high quality and reliable solder joints for electronic assemblies.
    The root cause of black-pad defects has been identified as hyper corrosion activity
    at gold and nickel-phosphorous interface which involves nickel depletion and an
    enrichment of phosphorous in localized areas. During Phase I, interfacial engineering
    approach had been used to successfully eliminate black pads by achieving marked
    improvement in corrosion resistance. This has led to robust solder joints and
    elimination of brittle failures. In Phase II, the focus will be to scale-up development,
    optimize the product/chemistries and carry out further reliability testing. The
    main goal would be the rapid commercialization of novel ENIG into the market.
    This will involve development of the chemistries/process parameters for replenishing
    solution to make it market ready, economical and efficient for customers, further
    chemical testing for quality compliance (shelf life, quality standards, etc.)
    as well as reliability testing. Reliability testing will involve real world scenarios
    and various industry standard based testing including drop and vibration tests
    and solder ball shear and pull tests at extended thermal exposures."

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop and apply machine learning statistical tools to Internet of Things (IoT) water delivery and water quality sensors. This will enable prediction and preemptive response to water point failures. The resilience of these environmental services is dependent upon credible and continuous indicators of reliability, leveraged by funding agencies to incentivize performance among service providers. In many locations, these service providers are utilities providing access to clean water, safe sanitation, and reliable energy. However, in some rural areas, there remains a significant gap between the intent of service providers and the impacts measured over time. Achieving the SBIR Phase II core objectives will help close the loop on effective and clean water delivery.  IoT sensors and services will address one of the most critical public health gaps by enabling delivery of reliable and safe water.

    IoT solutions for this environment may help address these information asymmetries and enable improved decisions and response. However, given the remote and power constrained environments and the high degree of variability between fixed infrastructure including age, materials, pipe diameters, power quality, rotating equipment vendors (pumps and generators), servicing, and functionality, any IOT solution would have to either be bespoke engineering, or compensate for these site-wise complexities through analytics. Instead, our SBIR II approach is to develop universal, solar powered cellular and satellite IOT hardware for each service type, and addresses site complexities through cloud-based sensor fusion and statistical learning. In this way, we significantly reduce hardware and logistical costs, and provide value to our customers through service delivery analytics. In Phase I, we demonstrated the application of simple sensors and sophisticated machine learning to identify off-nominal service delivery across a cohort of water pumps of various designs. We developed a universal electrical borehole sensor compatible with disparate fixed infrastructure, and we demonstrated solving the problem of heterogeneous customer hardware with a homogeneous sensor platform and adaptive machine learning backend.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will accelerate the adoption of data intensive precision agriculture, increasing yields while decreasing farm inputs such as fertilizers and pesticides. This project removes the software bottleneck (time and labor) in processing large aerial surveys taken by Unmanned Aerial Systems, enabling a cost-effective and timely process to deliver actionable information to farmers. Using frequent high-quality aerial scans, farmers may optimize the use of fertilizers and more finely control the amount of pesticides and herbicides necessary to increase crop yield. Furthermore, farmers mitigate costs and losses by being able to spot problem areas, minimize the spread of plant diseases, and identify issues such as standing water, irrigation malfunctions, and persistent automated machinery errors in planting or cultivation. This project provides special benefit for rural customers having inadequate internet infrastructure by eliminating the need to upload massive imagery to the cloud for processing. The technology is part of a broad initiative in agriculture addressing the need for large increases in food production by 2050 in response to the projected growth of the world?s population to over 9 Billion people.

    This project will continue development of algorithms for on-the-fly orthorectification, stitching, and normalization of aerial image mosaics and their deployment in an easy-to-use software prototype. The Phase I already demonstrated industry-leading speeds for such image processing. The technology behind this research project is designed from the ground up to process massive data with less memory and increased speed relative to other approaches, enabled by a proprietary streaming image representation, that allows multichannel gigapixel and terapixel images to be treated as ordinary images. This Phase II supports new extensions to the software that simplify and accelerate delivering a stitched and analyzed map, such as prioritizing computation in regions of the image that a customer is exploring. This would effectively eliminate the delay between image acquisition on unmanned aerial vehicles and when it can be used. Crop consultants have identified this as a transformative capability, as it enables ground-truthing information derived from aerial imagery in the same field visit, saving time and labor. The performance gains in compute-limited environments supported by this project are a key link between new capabilities to gather information and a farmer?s ability to utilize it to increase productivity while reducing costs.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project aims to disrupt hemodialysis delivery for treating end-stage renal disease (ESRD), a significant health burden in the US. Trends are moving toward patient-managed, in-home treatments. The goal of this proposal is to accelerate adoption of safer home hemodialysis therapy through development of continuously operating, wearable hemodialysis systems enabled by ultrathin and highly permeable silicon nanomembranes. Despite the recognized economic, health and quality-of-life benefits of more frequent hemodialysis treatments, adoption of home hemodialysis using present systems is being limited by doctors? and patients? safety concerns. Simpler and safer hemodialysis therapies will require breakthroughs in both device components and form-factors. The development of a small-scale, highly efficient dialysis system enabled by silicon nanomembranes holds potential for increasing adoption of home dialysis and its related benefits for the 430,000 US ESRD patients.

    Phase I results demonstrated feasibility of methods for large area nanomembrane fabrication, strengthened membranes and identified membrane area requirements for a dialysis system embodiment. Phase II objectives focus on completing larger area membrane fabrication, optimization of membrane filtration properties, integration of membranes into dialyzer modules and testing dialysis efficacy of these dialyzer modules in a nephrectimized sheep model.

    to develop precision-guided delivery of drugs or diagnostic compounds to the site
    of damage in traumatic brain injury (TBI). TBI is quite common; every year, over
    10 million people worldwide injure their brain, and it is the most common cause
    of death and disability in young people. There are currently no drugs available
    that would limit the additional damage to the brain from swelling and inflammation
    after the injury or help repair the brain. The company's technology allows one
    to guide a drug to the injured brain and keep it there until it has done its job,
    while less of the drug goes to normal tissues. This way, it will be possible to
    use drugs that, while beneficial in brain injury, may do damage elsewhere. It
    also makes it possible to use new types of drugs that would otherwise not reach
    their target in the brain. If the company is successful in bringing this technology
    to the clinic, it may make brain injury victims better, and significant savings
    to the healthcare system may also be obtained. \n\nThe proposed project will develop
    a highly efficacious technology platform for site-specific delivery of drugs to
    acute brain injury. The main reasons for the failure of neuro-protective agents
    in clinical trials are lack of specificity and the dose limiting effects of the
    therapy. Targeted delivery can circumvent this problem. In Phase I, the company
    described a novel peptide, CAQK, which specifically delivers various types of
    payloads to sites of brain injury from systemic administration. Developing improved
    variants of this peptide with high affinity and stability is important in ensuring
    optimal clinical translation of this technology. The objective of this project
    is to optimize the delivery platform by exploring different modifications of the
    CAQK peptide, and to use high throughput screening of chemical compound libraries
    to search for compounds that reproduce the CAQK activity. The outcome of this
    Phase II application will be a panel of stable, long-circulating, high affinity
    peptides and/or small molecule chemical mimetics that can be used for targeted
    drug delivery to injured brain. The most promising compounds will be validated
    in animal models of brain injury. Transformative advances in brain injury treatment
    in the form of increased efficacy, reduced side effects, and ease of administration
    should ensue."

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project supports the development of a technology to improve the way drugs are delivered in the body. Less than 2% of the dose of any medication finds its way to the place in the body where it is needed. The other 98% is either eliminated or, even worse, concentrates in areas where they can lead to side effects. This happens with all medications from daily anti-inflammatory drugs to the latest cancer therapies. If successful, this new approach will turn a regular drug into a medicine that is concentrated and activated only at the area where it is needed. This advance should increase the efficacy of the therapy and minimize its side effects. For example, the local drug activation can target chemotherapies to tumors with minimal side effects. Antibiotics could be delivered at higher local doses than is currently possible, eliminating local infections and limiting the creation of drug-resistant bacteria. Anti-inflammatory medications could be more powerful, improving the management of post-operative pain, potentially reducing the use and misuse of opioid drugs. Overall, this technology could reduce the costly burden of adverse drug events, estimated at more than $177 billion.

    To create targeted medicines, researchers rely on the endogenous differences between diseased tissue and the rest of the body (e.g., molecular markers or differences in enzymatic activity). Local drug activation provides a new path to create targeted medicines. The approach starts by injecting a biodegradable polymer at the desired site. The material contains exogenous chemical activators that do not exist anywhere else in the body. Then a drug is given systemically that is inactive until it comes in contact with the gel improving local efficacy and diminishing systemic side effects. Phase 1 results showed that an inactivated chemotherapy eliminated tumors in mice after only 10 days of therapy with minimal side effects. The Phase II project will expand the benefits of the local drug activation platform to other therapies, including cancer therapies and pain medications. The long-term goal is to show the applicability of the approach to multiple classes of drugs and increase their potential to improve outcomes for diseases that affect local areas of the body. If successful, this advance should enable medications for people who are too frail to receive them and enable therapies to work in combinations that were previously impossible due to dose-limiting toxicities.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be focusing on automatic pairing and provisioning of Internet of Things (IoT) for the Multi-Family-Home (MFH) industry, to help them increase revenue potential by digitizing their apartments. It is estimated that the Smart Home Automation industry will reach $71B by 2018. If installation and setup of IoT devices could be automated and simplified then the MFH industry could roll out Smart Apartments quickly and in large scale. Being able to gather data and insights on buildings could lead to increased revenue from more efficient use of labor and materials and through better management of energy. It also gives them the opportunity to create new revenue streams from software and services targeted at the data output. The MFH industry can also get insights on their entire building portfolio versus a single building and more efficiently manage their entire portfolio. The MFH industry implementing Smart Home Automation technology has huge societal benefits by integrating with smart grids and utility demand response programs. The potential energy savings of 18M Smart Apartments could be hundred thousand gigawatt hours or $7.3B in savings.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to enable the deployment of a scalable and maintainable infrastructure through the use of mechanisms including automatic pairing, tiered authentication, and network isolation in low cost, resource-constrained Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The problem with existing IoT pairing methods is that they are targeted at Single-Family-Home deployments and the number of nodes that needs to be paired are relatively minimal. However, this is not a scalable model when trying to address the needs of the Multi-Family-Home (MFH) industry. In the multi-family dwelling, the sheer density of nodes creates new problems. The technical challenge that remains for this phase is to ensure that all the devices will easily pair and to differentiate the nodes so that they authenticate and provision to the right apartment in a dense, RF noisy environment. Developing a cost effective, scalable solution for this high-density scenario is a key component to fulfilling the value proposition of mass deployment in the Multi-Family-Home industry. The anticipated result of this project is to solve the issue of pairing large quantities of end nodes and authenticating them appropriately to the correct apartment.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in reducing the energy consumption from air and gas compression.  In the United States, industrial air compressors consume over 12% of manufacturing electricity consumption, or 399 trillion BTU.  5% of natural gas production in the US is consumed by compression to move the gas to the end-user.  On a global basis, compressors driven by electric motors are estimated to consume 32% of the electricity consumption from electric motor driven systems, or 2,267 terawatt hours per year.  At $0.10 per kilowatt hour, this translates into nearly $227 billion of annual electricity costs for compression. Carnot's technology has the potential to reduce energy consumption from compression by 20% or more across multiple compression applications. By reducing the energy consumed for air and gas compression, the technology will reduce the carbon footprint of industrial and commercial activity in the US and internationally.



    Isothermal compression has been thought unachievable due to the requirement of rapidly capturing the heat of compression. The Phase I project allowed us to integrate proven design elements from prior prototypes, along with a complete liquid recirculation and heat dissipation system, into a single platform. This project will build upon research performed under the Phase I project to bring our compression technology to commercial readiness. A 2-year research and development plan will be executed to address key systems engineering elements of the technology to achieve commercial ready status.  A combination of lab experiments, thermodynamic modeling, design, engineering, and benchtop prototyping will be used to develop a commercial ready system design that can be applied to a broad range of industrial compression applications.  Further study and exploitation of isothermal compression may lead to an ever-evolving field of application, potentially creating additional areas of research and learning.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will address the challenge of fouling on membranes used in biopharmaceutical processing. The successful application of this coating would enable increase in the membrane lifetime and product yield of various production streams as less of the valuable compounds remain trapped in the membrane. This can increase production capacity for life-saving medicines, reduce production costs and, in certain cases, enable continuous biopharmaceutical manufacturing. Furthermore, functionalization of membranes currently involve significant quantities of environmentally harmful solvents, which may be leachable during usage of the membrane. This issue is avoided in the current project by utilizing initiated chemical vapor deposition (iCVD) process which does not require any solvent. This coating technology can also be extended to other systems including wastewater purification, food & beverage production, industrial separations, and medical devices that rely on a similar functionalization.

    The objective of Phase II will be to demonstrate a commercially viable manufacturing process to produce surface modifications within porous membranes using the iCVD process. Previous work in this subject has focused on top-coats on the top surfaces of reverse osmosis membranes, but the chemistries utilized have never before been demonstrated within interior structures of the membrane filters. During the Phase II work, the performance of the coatings will be optimized by using existing deposition equipment to tune the coating chemistry and process conditions to maximize the flux and throughput by minimizing protein fouling. The other main technical goal of the work will be to translate the current batch process into a continuous roll-to-roll process that is amenable to large-scale manufacturing. The outcome of this study will be a proven coating chemistry that is effective and durable in the membrane application, and an optimized manufacturing process capable of being implemented within current standards of membrane manufacturing.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the potential dollars saved in healthcare costs to environmental protection. The greatest overall savings cannot be judged only in dollars, but in helping to preserve human lives and end diseases and illnesses caused by problems with water. The product will provide unique opportunity to populations to test their water for safety and health benefits, in locations where good water treatment facilities do not exist. The water testing equipment market is divided into low-end, low-cost on-field test equipment (such as nitrate strip) that gives qualitative information about the analytes, and high-end testing devices used in labs (such as mass spectrometer) providing accurate quantitative information. If successful, the sensor technology will bridge the gap by providing low-cost, sensitive, accurate tools for quantitative measurement of analytes. The portable, low-cost, plug and play sensor product will cater to the needs of the water quality monitoring market. The product will also mobilize ?citizen scientist? to partake in environmental data collection and popularize sustainability education.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project is expected to lead to the development of a multiplexed, low-cost, portable instrument capable of making real time measurements of nitrate and phosphate in water and soil samples. The sensor system for this instrument will be based on the highly selective nitrate and phosphate reducing working electrodes along with reagents contained in the microfluidics to perform real-time sensing without sample preparation. As the concentrations of phosphate in solution are usually small, and since the inorganic phosphate in a water sample is changing due to biological processes, time is often a critical factor in taking measurements of phosphate. Due to these factors, there is a need for sensitive, inexpensive, and portable instruments in order to monitor the eutrophication process effectively. Currently available instruments for making phosphate measurements in the field do not adequately address these needs. Phase I development showed that disposable electrode with microfluidic integration, and smartphone app controlled sensor is capable of detecting nitrate with high sensitivity and specificity. Phase II proposal is focused on commercialization of the nitrate sensor and development of multiplexed sensor platform to detect multiple ions such as nitrate, and phosphate for larger commercial market.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project answers the call that science students go beyond memorizing facts to understand content on a deeper, conceptual level. In chemistry, this goal is particularly difficult to achieve because the underlying concepts describe the behaviors of particles that are not directly observable to students. College instructors are also under added pressure to transform their teaching methods to help ensure student retention and success. In the subject area of organic chemistry, this transformation is even more important, due to the relatively high fail-rate in the course, especially for under-represented minorities and first generation students. The mobile learning tools and data collection platform in this project would help to solve both of these issues with an innovative method for intuitive learning and assessment which helps to make molecules and reactions come alive with game-based mobile applications. The game apps are playable by students of all ages, so the concepts of organic chemistry, as well as other science courses, become familiar and accessible as early as middle school. The broader vision is to open the pipeline for students to progress into STEM careers which have been difficult to reach in the past.

    This project makes the theoretical touchable for organic chemistry students by building mobile game-based learning tools based on mechanisms, a key underlying concept used to teaching the course. This project will produce the Mechanisms suite of game apps, and bring an intuitive, tactile interface to learning chemistry. The research and development of this phase of the project will expand the user interaction model from Phase I to multiple modules of content for students. The data from the mobile learning tools will be synthesized with machine learning techniques to create an adaptive method to ensure the applications provide the appropriate level of challenge to the student learner. Clinical and longitudinal efficacy studies will be part of the research effort as the game modules are developed and released. The data platform will be optimized to integrate with multiple learning management systems and to be readily expandable to subjects beyond organic chemistry. The dashboard of the platform will allow both instructors and students to access the data and inform learning processes to achieve greater comprehension and success in the course. Commercialization will be achieved through direct-to-student downloads, subscriptions of the data platform by institutions, and licensing the technology to courseware providers.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is for the development of scaled processes for the industrial manufacture of end-user moldable advanced composite materials for use in protective athletic equipment. Currently, protective athletic equipment and accessories must be produced using industrial manufacturing techniques that have high tooling costs. As a result, manufacturers produce a small range of predetermined sizes and shapes, which do not provide a custom fit for end users. In the case of athletic gear, there is a growing market for hard-shell protective equipment which can be custom molded for a better fit. Polyimine polymers and advanced composites offer a compelling blend of strength and malleability in order to create more user-friendly lightweight and durable advanced composites that may be shaped by the end-user. In addition to creating greater user customization, both the virgin polyimine polymer, and advanced composites that incorporate polyimines, are intrinsically recyclable in a closed-loop, low-energy, solution-based system. The total U.S. composite materials market is $25 billion, representing 36% of the global composites sector. Polyimine polymers and advanced composite derivatives will reduce environmental waste and increase manufacturing efficiencies across a broad range of vertical markets in the composites sector including personal protective equipment, aerospace, automotive, and infrastructural materials.

    The intellectual merit of this project derives from the development of the unique chemistry of polyimine polymers. Polymers can be broadly grouped into two categories, thermosets and thermoplastics. Thermosets are strong due to the chemical characteristics of the plastic. However, once cured, thermosets cannot be reshaped. As a result, thermosets are neither repairable, nor are they efficiently recyclable. In contrast, thermoplastics, which are weaker than thermosets, may be molded and remolded. However, remolding requires very high temperatures. Polyimine polymers represent a new class of moldable and remoldable thermoset materials. Importantly, these polymers combine high rigidity and tough mechanical properties with mild molding temperatures. This Phase II research project will include scaled processes for the industrial manufacture of end user moldable composite materials that are a maximum of one-quarter inch in thickness and meet industry standards for limb joint protective equipment. The Phase II effort will also include a variety of types of material and mechanical testing, both in-house and at certified laboratories, in addition to extensive efforts at proving out manufacturability, as well as pilot production.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to increase global access to vaccines
    and reduce mortality associated with infectious diseases. As an example, Rotavirus
    is a major cause of severe gastroenteritis among young children and lack of vaccination
    results in 450,000 deaths annually. A thermostable rotavirus vaccine would create
    cost-savings for vaccine manufacturers, national governments, and non-profit vaccine
    buyers and enable market access in areas of the world that lack sufficient cold-chain
    capacity. Successful development of a stable rotavirus vaccine would not only
    have significant positive impact on global rotavirus immunization efforts, but
    may also revolutionize the general approach to vaccine delivery and distribution.
    This Phase II project will advance towards commercialization a novel platform
    technology that both stabilizes vaccines and enables novel delivery formats. This
    technology has significant commercial potential in that it can be broadly applied
    to numerous emerging and existing vaccines in the $24 Billion global market. \n\nThe
    proposed project seeks to leverage the unique properties of silk to meet the global
    need for robust, thermostable vaccines. Thermal instability is a long-standing
    problem in vaccine development. Despite efforts to improve stability, current
    formulation approaches do not allow product storage under ambient conditions.
    Temperature excursions during shipment and storage are common and result in wastage
    or administration of suboptimal vaccines. The use of silk fibroin, a low-cost
    biomaterial, represents a novel approach to vaccine stabilization. The goal of
    the proposed research is to advance the silk-stabilization platform towards commercialization
    of vaccines that do not require cold storage. Building upon successful Phase I
    results, advanced formulation optimization studies will define a final product
    formulation for rotavirus that is compatible with scaled manufacturing and achieves
    all storage and in vivo attributes necessary for a commercial product. Through
    process optimization studies, fabrication of a dissolvable thin strip for oral
    delivery of rotavirus will be translated into a scalable manufacturing process
    that provides an attractive alternative to traditional drying methods. Evaluation
    of stabilized rotavirus vaccine films in an improved animal model will enable
    validation of in vivo immunogenicity and offer insight into vaccine stabilization
    and oral film delivery more broadly."

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a robust, in-line plasmonic sensor for the detection of mercury in natural gas. Mercury naturally contaminates natural gas at the parts per million levels and can corrode critical aluminum components in processing facilities. Heat exchangers at Liquid Natural Gas (LNG) plants have failed catastrophically due to mercury corrosion, costing hundreds of millions of dollars of damage and injuring workers.  Current monitoring methods cannot operate at the high pressures found in the process gas lines, leading to inaccurate measurements and unreliable instruments. LNG is a growing share of global energy as natural gas replaces more carbon intensive fossil fuels. By 2020, 30 LNG plants will be operating world wide, for a total mercury monitoring market of $136 million. Mercury monitoring at petrochemical facilities broadly is a $216 million per year market.  Mercury itself is a neurotoxin and a global pollutant; our sensor has the potential to aid in efforts to detect and remove mercury before it can impact human health. Beyond mercury, plasmonic sensing is a novel technology with applications for a variety of chemical and biological species.

    The intellectual merit of this project derives from the utilization of a novel sensing platform based on the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of a gold nanoparticle film. It will build upon the success of the Phase I project, which demonstrated the suitability of LSPR sensors for the detection of elemental mercury vapor. This Phase II project will proceed along two objectives. The first objective will be to adapt the sensor for operations at high pressure; included in this objective is the redesign of key components of the system and the construction of a high-pressure test bench.  The second objective is testing the LSPR sensor in a natural gas matrix; preliminary results indicate that LSPR mercury sensors response well in methane, but the full range of response and lifetime performance will be investigated in this project. Upon completion of these two objectives, field trials will commence. The full system will be certified for use in a gas plant and demonstrated at a suitable natural gas plant. A commercial prototype LSPR based natural gas mercury monitor will be realized upon completion of this project.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will further develop and commercialize an innovative coating which minimizes the accumulation of mineral fouling on industrial heat exchanger surfaces.  Heat exchangers are used to heat or cool fluids in industrial processes, such as chemical manufacturing, oil refining, power generation, food processing, electronics manufacturing, and many more.  Air conditioning for factories and large commercial buildings also represents a significant use of heat exchangers.  Fouling occurs when naturally dissolved minerals in water, often called "hard" water, precipitate out of the water when it contacts a hot surface.  This fouling can be seen in a typical home on the surface of a teakettle or showerhead.  The resulting mineral crystals adhere strongly, and form an insulating layer that materially reduces the thermal efficiency of industrial heat exchangers.  Mineral fouling is estimated to cost U.S. industry $40 Billion per year, and waste $3 Billion of energy, representing upwards of 1% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.  In addition to wasting energy, this worldwide, never-ending problem increases factory downtime and maintenance costs, causes industry to spend large amounts on chemical treatment of water supplies, and decreases the useful life of heat exchanger systems.  An effective coating will result in substantial environmental benefits including the elimination of greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the wasted energy, and a reduction of the water treatment chemicals, which eventually enter community wastewater streams.

    The coating material is a low surface energy, self-assembling hydrophobic material which is a composite of a host polymer and a nanoparticle. The low surface energy of the coating impedes the attachment of the minerals to the coated heat transfer surface. Phase I results showed that any fouling accumulation on a coated surface exhibits low adhesion strength, which allows any fouling that does occur to predominantly be dislodged by the force of the water flowing over it - a phenomenon call "self-cleaning."  The coating is very thin - less than 500 nm - which minimizes impedance of heat transfer due to the presence of the coating itself.  Phase II research will focus on optimizing the properties of the coating, including substrate adhesion, surface energy, and toughness to ensure a useful life under industrial conditions.  This will be accomplished by changing the host polymer chemistry to facilitate self-assembly, and also by changing the chemistry of the nanoparticle to obtain a covalent bond between the host polymer and nanoparticle.  Work will also be performed to design the application process for industrial scale, and validate lab results with field trials at industrial sites.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is to help protect the environment by replacing existing toxic and environmentally-hazardous corrosion inhibitors used as lubricant additives with more eco-friendly alternatives. Release of lubricants (for example from loss during use, improper disposal of waste lubricants, accidental spillage, or off-shore drilling) has the potential to cause damage to the environment. Awareness of the toxic nature of current lubricant additives is a driver to develop new technologies for more environmentally friendly products. This project addresses the development of novel, environmentally friendly corrosion inhibitor lubricant additives. Besides the environmental benefits of the new technology, the lubricant industry  may also benefit by expansion into environmentally sensitive market sectors (for example, marine lubricants used on ships) through the use of safer and less toxic additives. The new products also utilize non-petroleum based raw materials from renewable and sustainable resources, thus reducing dependence on petroleum. Apart from being non-toxic and environmentally friendly, the proposed products are also expected to be more effective inhibitors as compared to the products currently used in the market.

    The objectives of this Phase II research project are to design and develop environmentally friendly corrosion inhibitors providing high performance while meeting the eco-toxicological requirements of environmentally acceptable lubricants (EAL), including bio-lubricants. The use of corrosion inhibitors in lubricants is essential to protect metal surfaces. Unfortunately, many commercial corrosion inhibitors present issues with aquatic toxicity, persistence in the environment, and/or bioaccumulation that render them unacceptable for use in EAL or bio-lubricants. Awareness of the eco- toxicological problems of current inhibitors and the implementation of new regulations mandating the use of EAL in certain applications (e.g. marine lubricants) has created an urgent need in the market to replace existing products and the opportunity to develop new technologies for corrosion inhibition. This proposal addresses the key steps involved in the product development of corrosion inhibitors for biolubricants; namely (a) molecular design optimization, (b) cost-effective process scale up, (c) preparation of pound scale of lead products in the laboratory set-up; as identified in Phase I, (c) assessment of eco-toxicological properties using industry standard OECD/ASTM test methods and structure activity relationship (SAR) calculations, and (d) product storage stability testing.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the expedited development of a novel non-surgical medical device and therapeutic treatment for the approximately 1 in 3 women over the age of 30 who suffer from urinary incontinence, two thirds of whom, in part due to notable deficiencies of available solutions, elect to live without treatment while their symptoms progressively worsen. Urinary incontinence, although a very private concern, has far-reaching physical, psychological, social, and economic implications. For example, urinary incontinence has been found to reduce health-related quality of life measures on par with depression, incontinence is the number one reason for admittance into nursing homes, and the annual cost to the US healthcare system is estimated at $25 billion. Through design and validation activities this project will demonstrate the functionality of a wearable device that provides discreet, comfortable, easy-to-use therapy for female stress urinary incontinence. The technological understanding gained through this work lays the groundwork for subsequent commercialization of an FDA cleared product that will enhance the lives of tens of millions of American women.

    The proposed project provides a new framework for wearable therapeutics by enabling the patient to treat incontinence via discreet surface electrical stimulation without interruption to daily activity. Current non-surgical care often involves electrical stimulation via intravaginal probe, a treatment most woman are not willing to adopt or maintain. This project builds on successful Phase I feasibility work in which a contiguous array of cutaneous electrodes placed proximate the perineal tissue to deliver sufficient electrical muscle stimulation to promote pelvic floor toning were shown to maintain this efficacy under conditions associated with continuous wear.  The Phase II project goal is to develop an incontinence specific electrical muscle stimulator to function with the electrode array.  The system architecture will enable manipulation of the therapeutic waveform to support future multi-armed clinical studies designed to test the efficacy of various treatment regimens.  The system will also track treatment frequency, duration and intensity to provide information to clinical researchers.  Activity will include design, prototype fabrication, performance testing, human factors assessments, iteration and electrical safety validation.  Refinements to the electrode array are also anticipated.  The project will deliver a device suitable for future evaluation a human clinical studies, FDA clearance and product commercialization.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project includes new ways to inform, educate, advertise or entertain through a technology called projection mapping. This technology uses commodity video projectors to augment the surfaces of ordinary objects; applications range from advertising, events, and entertainment, to educational experiences at museums or schools, healthcare applications for rehabilitation and visualization, and simulation (e.g. military or employee training). Through multiple deployments at retail locations across the country, the company's prototypes have demonstrated that these applications will benefit not only the brands and companies that employ the technology, but also the end-users (students, consumers, etc), resulting in better engagement and faster learning when compared to achieving these same tasks through other media such as videos. Research performed during the Phase II project will allow the company to develop a scalable product and fulfill many deployments, bringing projection mapping to new markets. A free version of the company's software will also be available for non-commercial and academic use, enabling interdisciplinary research in fine arts and computer science. The R&D results generated from the research will be published and disseminated to the public.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will build a commercially viable and scalable projection mapping system. While projection mapping has a long academic history, this captivating medium still remains out of commercial reach. As learned from over 50 customer discovery interviews, retailers are shifting towards location-based experiences to increase customer engagement and sales. Many other industries have a similar need to attract attention and convey information, but without a scalable product that can be easily deployed and maintained, they lack the means to provide these experiences. To address this need, the company will develop hardware and software systems to enable captivating and immersive projection mapping experiences. The core of this system is in software: the developed algorithms will robustly calibrate projection mapping systems comprising any number of projectors/cameras, automatically align projected content to the scene and perform color-correction when the display surfaces are non-white/textured. These algorithms will be validated through standard benchmarks, resulting in novel, state-of-the-art practices. Additionally, these methods will allow for reusable projection mapping content, a critical feature lacking in existing software, as well as cloud deployment and monitoring. New hardware configurations will also be developed to achieve new uses for projection mapping.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will enable a commercial implementation of holographic video microscopy, a fast, precise and flexible technology for measuring the properties of individual colloidal particles suspended in fluid media. This disruptive technology solves critical manufacturing problems across industries that work with colloidal dispersions.  Demonstrated applications include: 1) monitoring the growth of nanoparticle agglomerates in precision slurries used to polish semiconductor wafers where scratches due to slurry agglomerates are responsible for waste valued at $1 billion annually; 2) tracking concentrations of dangerous contaminants in wastewater streams; and 3) measuring the concentration of protein aggregates in biopharmaceuticals, a safety concern noted by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in this $250 billion industry.  Holographic video microscopy is unique among particle-characterization technologies in providing comprehensive information about the size, shape and composition of individual particles in real time and in situ. Having access to this wealth of data facilitates product development, creates new opportunities for process control and provides a new tool for quality assurance across a broad spectrum of industries enabling safer, less expensive products for consumers while providing cost savings to manufacturers.

    The technical objectives of this project are: 1) to optimize the design of the underlying holographic microscopy system without compromising the quality of results; 2) to enable quantitative concentration determination including corrections for perturbations introduced by flow dynamics; 3) to expand the domain of operation to characterize non-spherical particles and 4) to apply machine-learning algorithms for automated robust operation.  Using holographic video microscopy for commercial applications requires adaptation and innovation in the design of the prototype instrument that was used to demonstrate feasibility. Streamlining the optical train will require advanced modeling and the creation of new methods of correcting optical aberrations to enable ease of manufacture. Additional improvements in design will include advances in improving microfluidic flow control to generate accurate concentration determination, to adapt holographic analysis algorithms for characterizing the structure of aspheric particles, and to extend analytical capabilities for turbid fluids. Finally, innovative machine-learning using neural network algorithms demonstrated significant improvements for analytical robustness in Phase I and will be extended to a wider range of applications. The Phase II effort will enable holographic video microscopy of real-world samples with typical measurement times of a few minutes.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project affects one of the fastest-growing sectors of the US economy. E-commerce sales in 2015 accounted for 7.4% of total U.S. retail and are expected to rapidly rise. The potential for the commercial impact of general each-picking systems is high, as current manual labor methods are pain points for distribution centers; human picking is unpleasant, expensive and inefficient due to high absenteeism, high turnover and human error. The success of the proposed technology will also contribute to American competitiveness in the robotics industry. Of the top 20 distribution system integrators, only three are currently based in the U.S. Robotics is going to be the key driver of progress in this area, where each-picking, our core product capability, is a key component of future automated distribution systems. Beyond warehousing logistics, applications that our technology can benefit include: broad applications of industrial automation and manufacturing; military applications (e.g., IED disposal, where robots can perform tasks that are dangerous for humans to perform); and assistive healthcare (e.g., where robots must be compliant enough to be safe around humans while interacting successfully with unknown environments).

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will focus on the development of a state-of-the-art each-picking robotic system and its deployment, initially targeted at the order fulfillment industry. To date, robotic systems have enabled significant progress on transporting inventory on shelves or in totes. However, there has not yet been a deployed system that can perform the task of picking individual items from inventory bins and placing them in boxes for shipment. During Phase I of this project, RightHand Robotics developed a picking system far in advance of the research literature on robotic grasping, picking tens of thousands of items previously unseen objects, with error rates of less than 0.1%. During Phase II, the project will focus on advancing the state of the art in data-driven refinement of grasp planning using machine learning techniques, and will develop methods for box-packing that exploit the company?s advanced compliant grippers. These improvements will result in an average pick-and-place time of 6 seconds or less and an undetected placement failure rate of fewer one in ten thousand.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is its potential to revolutionize human-machine interfaces, with possible applications in computer-aided design (CAD); military, maintenance, and pilot training interfaces; industrial and construction operator interfaces; robotic and laparoscopic surgery; physical therapy, rehabilitation, and swing training; education; telerobotics; automotive navigation and safety systems; and video games. While haptic interactions in these applications can already be portrayed with desktop robotic force feedback devices, the developed haptic technology could provide realistic haptic feedback at a much lower price point (required for consumer devices) and unlike current force feedback devices, the developed haptic devices can be used to naturally interact in large workspace applications like motion-input video games or VR experiences. The proposed research will enhance the scientific understanding of human-haptic and multi-modal interactions in virtual environments, and will create a model for this technology to migrate into adjacent fields.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project seeks to meet the market demand for intuitive, immersive, and inexpensive haptic technologies in the emerging field of consumer virtual reality (VR). Multiple companies are now making inexpensive 3D head-mounted displays (HMDs) for VR, but current haptic interfaces are either too expensive, have limited range of motion, or are too crude to portray realistic haptic interactions in VR. The company has created an ungrounded haptic motion controller that utilizes a new form of touch feedback that applies in-hand shear forces to create compelling physical feedback at a price that is viable for consumer markets. The proposed research objectives are based on feedback from key stakeholders and VR enthusiasts who have tried the company?s current high-end haptic controllers. Their feedback suggests improving the overall user experience of the controllers through reducing device size, mass, and system latency, while improving device ergonomics and reducing cost. The Phase II research builds on the findings of Phase I, which showed that even simpler implementations of the newly developed haptic technology were still found to be more compelling than traditional vibration feedback. The project will result in a reference design that can be mass produced.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is in line with the trend in medicine towards a prevention paradigm, following the premise that preventing problems is generally less costly than treating the problem or managing a future deficit. Excessive noise in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) has been clearly linked to cognitive deficits among the patients of these care areas. However, isolating the infants from any voice contact is also detrimental to language skill development. This project will investigate and develop a system that will provide for a more stable stay in the NICU, mitigate neurologic complications leading to developmental delays, and lessen the occurrence of hearing loss. The American Academy of Pediatrics? guidelines state that neonatal patients should not be exposed to noises greater than 45dBA yet hospitals struggle to achieve this. Deploying such a noise attenuation system with voice pass through capabilities will help hospitals provide the proper environment for their neonatal populations. Hospital administrators and clinical directors have expressed enthusiasm for this solution.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project seeks to develop an active noise reduction system for use in an NICU incubator, while allowing a parent's voice to pass through essentially unattenuated. To achieve the noise attenuation, the unwanted noise is monitored outside and inside the incubator and a corresponding signal exactly out of phase with the detected noise is used to largely cancel the unwanted noise. The system will employ a multi-channel hybrid system employing both feedback and feedforward elements. While a more complex approach, this has been shown to have performance advantages over simpler solutions. In this phase, the size of the zone of attenuation will be expanded, the algorithm will be adapted to multiple incubators having differing shapes, and a set of fail-safe provisions will be implemented.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the potential to bring a disruptive neutron detector technology to market, filling an urgent demonstrated need for real time, portable and wearable radiation detectors. Successful commercialization of the innovative Cerenkov BoroSilicate Glass (CBSG) technology will serve a broad customer base in the nuclear detection and verification industry. Market research indicates large scale potential, in the billions of dollars. This market is currently well served with gamma ray and x-ray detection devices, but the capabilities for portable and wearable neutron detectors are not as well established. The proposed technology will close this gap and is anticipated to have a very broad impact. The Cerenkov detector technology can also be transformative in enabling new kinds of directional arrays for neutron imaging and portal detectors, helping to make the nation's borders more secure against illicit nuclear materials and providing improved tools for nuclear safeguards and verification.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to commercialize an innovative neutron detector module based 100% on solid-state technology. The overall objective of the project is to build on the successful Cerenkov BoroSilicate Glass (CBSG) detector prototyping in Phase I/IB to develop a small, low cost, modular neutron detector which can be integrated with existing gamma detector technologies to 1) form a comprehensive, scalable, networked solution to the problem of Special Nuclear Material detection; 2) enable inexpensive in-house and third party integration of neutron detection technology into radioisotope identification devices and personal radiation dosimeters; and 3) allow for  further testing and advanced product development relating to directional neutron detector networks, direct fast neutron detectors, and neutron spectroscopy. The research objectives include a thorough quantitative assessment of the detector front-end material response to neutron radiation and evaluation of its optoelectronic characteristics. In particular, in collaboration with a specialty glass manufacturer, the isotopic composition of glass front-end will be optimized for fast neutron detection. The anticipated result is a novel and disruptive neutron detection approach.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be in the field of healthcare.  The United States spends approximately $9,000 per person per year on healthcare.  Ultrasound medical imaging is a medical imaging technology that could lower costs by providing an alternative to higher-cost imaging techniques.  The technology created during this Phase II project is expected to increase the quality, value, and accessibility of medical ultrasound, which would in turn reduce medical imaging costs in the US healthcare system.  Furthermore, the company's technology is expected to bring ultrasound to more clinical settings and improve system-wide efficiencies in the diagnosis and treatment of disease.  The technology also has commercial potential in the international market, with $5.8B spent annually on medical ultrasound devices worldwide.  Finally, by improving the utility of ultrasound, the technology will lead to improved patient care and may ultimately save lives.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop deep learning technology for ultrasound imaging in medicine.  Ultrasound imaging has numerous benefits including real-time image acquisition, non-invasive scanning, low-cost devices, and no known side-effects (it is non-ionizing).  However, variability in quality has encumbered its adoption and utility.  As a result, more expensive imaging is typically utilized, often exposing patients to ionizing radiation.  Our objective is to develop, improve, and test machine learning techniques, based on deep learning, to improve ultrasound acquisition and interpretation.  We expect this project will create novel technologies that make ultrasound easier to use and improve the quality of ultrasound examinations.  The end result will improve the quality, value, and accessibility of medical ultrasound examinations, will result in cost savings to the healthcare system, will produce improvements in patient care, and will support a sustainable business opportunity.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will improve the performance of encased atomic force microscopy (AFM) cantilevers, reduce their fabrication costs, and optimize their properties for next-generation scanned probe microscopy technologies.  Atomic force microscopy is a workhorse technique for providing nanometer-scale information of materials, but its performance is compromised by viscous damping when operated in fluid.  The encased cantilevers to be developed in this project significantly reduces damping, leading to high force sensitivity and performance which is identical to AFM imaging done in air.  This aids quantitative interpretation of data and simplifies instrument operation. Encased cantilevers are a drop-in replacement, permitting the transformation of existing instruments into cutting-edge tools simply by exchanging the probe.  The impacts of these products will be felt in fields from biology to clean energy to materials science.

    The first technical objective of this research is to create new cantilever geometries that push the performance of our devices to the theoretical limits. The Phase I research resulted in a novel low-cost technique to fabricate encased cantilevers, thanks to the development of specialized semi-automated processing and quality control tools. The next technical objective of Phase II research is to further reduce fabrication costs by improving yields, increasing batch size, and implementing more manufacturing automation. We expect to demonstrate low-cost processing methods in which many high quality probes are fabricated efficiently. The third technical objective is to optimize these devices for next-generation scanned probe technologies including quantitative nanomechanical mapping, high-speed imaging and promising novel techniques such as photo induced force microscopy.  At the end of the project period we will have optimized products specifically targeting these high growth applications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the development of technology for the intracellular delivery of biomolecules directly into cells. This microfluidics-based platform has the potential to become an enabling technology for intracellular delivery, which may be used to accelerate drug discovery R&D by allowing reliable, efficient delivery of diverse material classes without having to engineer the material or the cell to natively uptake these molecules. Such capabilities could allow pharmaceutical companies to assess the efficacy of drug candidates faster than ever before, especially with integration into high-throughput robotic workflows that are already well-established and efficacious. The technology could dramatically reduce the time to market for new drugs by decoupling determination of a candidate's activity from the cell's affinity for the molecule. It also could facilitate a deeper understanding of biological processes and pathways. Initial studies with leading drug developers and academic laboratories towards this goal have been very encouraging, and, in the future, the platform could potentially enable robust engineering of cell function for cell-based therapies targeting a diversity of diseases including influenza, cancer, and even autoimmune disorders.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes the continued development of the intracellular delivery technology to address relevant applications in drug discovery R&D. New drug discovery is often hampered by the inability of membrane-impermeable drug candidates to enter the cell cytosol, necessitating exogenous materials for delivery such as strong electric fields or viral vectors. However, these materials tend to cause off-target effects or toxicity, presenting a need for a technology that can facilitate delivery without altering post-treatment cellular function. The goal of this project is to demonstrate a platform geared towards market adoption of microfluidic hardware as the standard method for transfection and intracellular delivery. During Phase II, the platform will be fully-characterized, validated, and verified in order to produce the consistent, repeatable results necessary to achieve market entry. In addition, research is planned to demonstrate the ability of the platform to support drug discovery R&D by developing the use of the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system for use with this intracellular delivery technology.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to manufacture an advanced hybrid energy harvester that can enable broad deployment of wireless sensor networks. Self-sustainable uninterrupted low-cost power supply with small size is in urgent need for internet of things, portable electric devices, wireless sensor networks, infrastructure health monitoring, active control, and battleground soldier support. Scavenging ambient energy from environment to power these devices can eliminate the cost of replacing batteries, particularly in remote environment. The hybrid energy harvesters developed in this project will significantly improve the power output and response dynamic frequency, therefore provide sufficient power to many such devices. The high power density will also enable more frequent data acquisition and transmission of such sensor networks, and promote more ubiquitous deployment of advanced sensor networks. The automatic manufacturing process will enable their adoption by various customers including internet of things.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase 2 project will develop manufacturing processes for advanced hybrid energy harvesters. Although piezoelectric energy harvesters have found broad applications, their power density and mechanical-electrical conversion efficiency are still low, with values at microwatts to milliwatt and <10%, respectively since they primarily operate at the d31 mode of the piezoelectric transducer and the mechanical impedance mismatch between the vibration source and the harvesting device. The Phase I project successfully demonstrated that the advanced hybrid energy harvesting device can provide significantly higher power density at > 100 mW and conversion efficiency at > 40% by using the more efficient d33 piezoelectric mode and with reduced stiffness in a curved structure that can efficiently transfer the energy from the vibration source to the active piezoelectric materials. The Phase II project will be focused on developing low-cost innovative automatic manufacturing process to enable their practical applications in commercial and industrial market.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is that it will dramatically increase the efficiency of communications networks. Commercially, the ability to dynamically, adaptively and optimally route traffic on data networks will lead to network cost savings ranging from 60% - 70% for network service providers. Critically, the project leverages the recent industry shift towards software-defined networking (SDN) that is projected to become a $45 billion market by 2020. The excitement behind SDN is driven primarily by the promised performance benefits of better traffic control. By bringing to market its provably optimal, dynamic and adaptive traffic control algorithms, the company will be uniquely positioned to capitalize on this market opportunity. The immediate resulting social impact will be that end users will have access to faster, cheaper and more robust data networks. In the longer term, efficient software control of networks will enable rapid innovation in networking leading to new network applications that have not even been envisioned yet. The project also enhances technological and scientific understanding by commercially verifying the company's solution to a longstanding open problem in networking - namely, whether an easy to deploy, dynamic, adaptive and optimal routing algorithm can be found.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on delivering commercial, smart, traffic control algorithms that can unlock the full capacity of modern communications networks. Today, due to unprecedented traffic growth, network operators face major challenges in the form of efficient resource utilization. The problem is that the inherent randomness of data traffic has led to network designers over-provisioning networks to the point where they run at 30% - 40% utilization on average. The company's competitive advantage is a new algorithm that allows it to optimally manage traffic variations by adjusting network routes in real time while retaining the scalability and simplicity of today's protocols. The goal in this project is to build on the beta tests from Phase I by developing an enterprise-grade, cloud-based network control application that is ready for general market launch. To this end, the company will start with small commercial deployments at selected test partners. Feedback from these deployments will be used to iron out any issues before general market launch. By the end of the project, the company anticipates generating significant revenue from initial customers as it continues to innovate and maintain its current lead in developing SDN control plane software.

    to commercialize high-strength thermoplastic composites reinforced with cellulosic
    nanoparticles (CNs) as a replacement for heavier glass&#8208;reinforced composite
    materials for structural automotive components. The broader impact/commercial
    potential of this project is to create sustainable, high&#8208;performance nanocomposites.
    Expected weight savings is between 13 and 20% per component. Corporate Average
    Fuel Economy (CAFE) regulations require significant increases in fuel economy
    for vehicles, which has led carmakers to look for innovative ways to shed vehicle
    weight. It has been shown that for every 10% in weight savings, vehicle fuel consumption
    is reduced by 7%. The target application is to replace heavy glass reinforcement
    in polymeric composites with CNCs for car parts, providing lighter weight vehicles
    with increased fuel efficiency.  On&#8208;going research into CN materials has
    resulted in significant reductions in cost (with more reductions expected), making
    CNs an increasingly attractive functional natural nanofiller, the processing of
    which will provide jobs in both the manufacturing and the technology sector.  Successful
    implementation of CNs into composites could not only lighten vehicles and reduce
    environmental impact, but also transform a waste stream into value-added materials,
    reducing the amount of waste produced by these industries.  \n\nDuring the SBIR
    Phase I period, the company showed that lighter thermoplastic composites reinforced
    with cellulosic nanoparticles could meet the tensile strength values of glass-reinforced
    composites with much higher loadings, thereby saving part weight.  The Phase II
    grant will allow the company to scale up the manufacturing processes necessary
    to produce these lighter, more sustainable composites for the automotive industry.
    Furthermore, the company will improve performance of these materials in order
    to attain performance parity with higher&#8208;loaded glass&#8208;reinforced parts
    and potentially to compete with ultra&#8208;high performance materials such as
    carbon fiber composites and metals. This technology will be produced using efficient
    and economical manufacturing processes, allowing this to become a true drop&#8208;in
    technology for automotive part-makers."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to enable the availability of a revolutionary manufacturing process for pharmaceuticals. The project consists of the development of novel process technologies, as well as the integration of these processes into an end-to-end continuous manufacturing line that can produce drugs continuously (24/7 basis). This is different from the current methodology that produces large quantities of drugs at discrete time points (e.g. large batch quantities are produced several times a year).  A working pilot plant of this process demonstrated significant operational advantages with a marketed drug-production time was reduced from 200 days to 2 days, plant footprint decreased by 90%, projected costs reduced by 50%, while improving product quality.  The impact on society will be considerable: patients will receive better quality drugs; drug shortages will be greatly reduced; and pharmaceutical companies will be able to manufacture and distribute their drugs in a much more cost-effective and efficient manner, allowing them to reallocate more capital to Research and Development (new drugs developed).  Finally, it will be possible to relocate manufacturing plants and jobs back in the U.S. (more efficient processes = lower costs).

    The proposed project builds upon a successful Phase I SBIR project, as well as five years of collaboration between a premier research institution and a leading pharmaceutical company aimed at developing a novel continuous manufacturing process to overcome the limitations of the current standard, batch manufacturing.  The first objective of this NSF project is to further develop two novel elements of a multistep, continuous manufacturing process (i.e. heterogeneous crystallization and electrospinning for solid dosage forms), so they run reliably under different operating conditions. This is important because commercial production requires that they perform consistently and reliably 24/7. Thus, these novel unit operations will be studied under different operating conditions and starting materials, while their design is optimized.  Success will be defined when the unit operations achieve: 1) maximal operational efficiency, 2) industry standard manufacturing capabilities, and 3) qualification to be used across the Research and Development manufacturing spectrum.  The second objective is to integrate these two units into a broader end-to-end continuous manufacturing process capable of producing high-quality pharmaceuticals on a continuous basis. The integrated process will also feature three unit operations on separation, filtration and drying that were developed during Phase I of this SBIR project.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project allows for a more effective glaucoma treatment by adjusting eye pressure based on disease progression for each patient. In 2015, the US glaucoma market is estimated to be over $2 billion and our addressable market, glaucoma surgical therapies, is estimated to be $534M. The incidence for glaucoma increases with age, and as the baby boomer population gets older, there will be a growing need for glaucoma treatments. To treat glaucoma, patients undergo lifelong drug regimens, multiple laser procedures, and invasive surgical procedures. However, even with all these treatment options glaucoma patients still go blind from glaucoma. The proposed novel design and approach to glaucoma will personalize the treatment for patients and remove the need for numerous and costly procedures. Most importantly, the personalization of glaucoma therapy will optimize visual protection for every patient.

    The proposed project will validate the safety and efficacy of a glaucoma drainage device to adjust and set pressure in the eye. Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness and is only treatable by reducing eye pressure. Surgical treatments are unpredictable with suboptimal success rates based primarily on the choice of drainage site. The proposed novel device drains to a new area of the eye to avoid the complications and unpredictability associated with the current glaucoma surgeries. The device also can provide the first-ever personalized treatment for millions of glaucoma sufferers by fine-tuning pressure based on the needs of the patient throughout his or her lifetime. Phase I/IB studies have shown feasibility of the device with an adjustable component.  However, its efficacy and safety have yet to be fully investigated. Therefore, in this Phase II research grant, we will optimize the device for safety and efficacy and perform the necessary preclinical testing according to FDA standards to further develop the product.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop a new analytical chemistry instrument for rapid quantitation of residual chemical impurities in complex mixtures. The target application for this project is the detection of genotoxic impurities during early drug development in pharmaceutical manufacturing. The instrument to be developed uses Fourier transform molecular rotational resonance (FT-MRR) spectroscopy to identify molecules based on their three dimensional geometry, which permits high chemical specificity.  FT-MRR is a high-resolution spectroscopy technique that makes it possible to directly analyze gas mixtures containing a large number of chemicals without the need for prior chemical separation using chromatography - a time-consuming step of current analysis methods that requires significant technical supervision.  As a result, FT-MRR based chemical analysis instruments have the potential to speed up innovation for pharmaceutical manufacturers by reducing analytical development cycles from weeks to hours during the high-throughput drug innovation process.  Chemical analysis instruments using FT-MRR spectroscopy enable faster innovation in research and development labs with the added benefit of seamless method transferability to on-line process monitoring applications and routine quality control for final product release.

    The ability to transfer analysis methods into routine analysis is important to the industry goal of continuous manufacturing for pharmaceuticals.  It is enabled for FT-MRR in part (yet critically) by the two main objectives of this Phase II effort: the development of sampling automation for FT-MRR and the design of a cost-reduced, targeted FT-MRR system.  Concepts for both of these designs were successfully tested during Phase I.  The intellectual merit of this project is the introduction of a new technique for chemical analysis that senses chemicals based on the absolute molecular structure, with no orthogonal analysis required.  FT-MRR spectral fingerprints can distinguish molecular isomers, conformers, isotopologues, and even enantiomers.  With this kind of absolute structure information, FT-MRR can enable new studies that trace chemical pathways with site-specific isotopic ratio information and chiral detection.  Both concepts are otherwise very challenging with current technology.  The FT-MRR instrument to be built for this project combines recent advances in high-power, solid-state millimeter wave (mm-wave) light sources, low-cost microwave synthesizer integrated circuits, and high-speed digital electronics to implement a time-domain, Fourier transform (FT) measurement approach.  Standard methods for chemical sampling will be integrated to maximize the ease-of-use and robustness of FT-MRR instruments.

    Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project investigates the deposition
    of water-based nanoparticle solutions using industrially scalable methods and
    results in valuable scientific knowledge that is not currently available in the

    both the scientific literature and commercial products. However, most coatings
    suffer from either high deposition costs, or a trade-off between durability and
    performance. In this project, methods to increase the durability of a low-cost,

    The coated glass will be subjected to industry standard reliability and durability
    tests. The expected outcome of this work is the demonstration of this technology
    at a pilot level with industry collaborators."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the significant improvement of
    surgical accuracy, which will dramatically reduce surgical errors, improve outcomes and
    reduce healthcare costs. In spine surgery alone, there are more than 500,000
    procedures every year in the US utilizing implants such as screws. In 4% to 11% of
    these surgeries, the implant placement is inaccurate. For the patient this translates into
    longer recoveries - from days to weeks - and in many cases into a second revision
    surgery. The patient is non-productive, unable to carry out their daily routines for weeks,
    while the healthcare system has to absorb the costs of the longer recovery as well as
    the revision surgeries. For both the healthcare and economic systems these are
    avoidable costs. The medical imaging technology being developed in this project has
    the potential to eliminate surgical inaccuracies across the $2.4B market of image
    guidance, improving clinical applications that range from orthopedic surgery to minimally
    invasive vascular interventions, to cancer diagnosis and treatments.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project will demonstrate a
    novel imaging modality, which provides near-real-time 3D live imaging - 4D - during
    surgery. This novel system will provide surgical imaging at a lower x-ray dose than
    fluoroscopy (current standard), with a geometry that allows concurrent imaging with
    surgery. This 4D technology has the potential to significantly reduce surgical
    inaccuracies, improve outcomes and reduce costs. Phase 1 successfully demonstrated
    the feasibility of the reconstruction algorithm used by the proposed imaging modality by
    showing its potential of higher surgical accuracy in a single spinal screw insertion. This
    Phase 2 project will I) prove the robustness of the reconstruction algorithm across a
    variety of use-cases, II) demonstrate the clinical usability of the 4D scanner, and III)
    confirm the clinical utility of the scanner. The clinical usability will be studied with an
    ergonomic model in a surgical setting. The clinical utility will be proven by building a
    system prototype and performing image quality and x-ray dose comparisons versus
    fluoroscopy and 3D in a realistic surgical setting. Preliminary results show that these
    objectives are achievable. This research is readying the technology for clinical research,
    regulatory clearance and commercialization.

    and market entry in 2017. US government planners have described a need for many
    thousands of additional ventilators in the event of a pandemic influenza or other
    large-scale medical emergency. Severe influenza often leads to respiratory distress
    which cannot be dealt with in the absence of mechanical ventilation. Given some

    on its own. Without help from the ventilator, patients may die. Manufacturers
    of current ventilators have attempted to reconfigure their existing offerings
    to meet the stockpiling demand. Unfortunately none of these devices are able to
    match the price/performance ratio needed to make stockpiling in large numbers

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will eliminate remaining barriers to the production of bamboo fibers for use as a reinforcement in polymer composites. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be an increased usage of sustainable materials, increased revenue for US agriculture, and increased domestic and international sales of a new and innovative product line.  Success in this project will also lead to domestic job creation needed to support the research, manufacturing, and sales of these composites. The processes to be finalized during this Phase II project will support the growth of a nascent based on US-manufactured, environmentally-friendly products. Within three years of launch, it is expected that over $4 million in revenue will be generated by sales of bamboo fiber.  Moreover, increases in bamboo cultivation as a result of these new products will help mitigate adverse environmental impacts and improve public health. This will be done by the inherent sequestration of carbon dioxide in the plant growth cycle, and a reduction in the pollution associated with the use of high-energy glass fiber and plastics processing techniques.

    This Phase II project will address the following research topics:  species variations, manufacturability, additional high value products, additional composite properties, processing and treatment optimization, and commercial scale-up. The team will assess the mechanical and physical implications of variations in feedstock by the use of filament tensile testing. Surface treatments specific to bamboo fibers will be finalized, with the goal of increased fiber-matrix interfacial adhesion, mitigation of water absorption, and compatibility with at least three major resins systems.  These treatments will be evaluated via composite tensile testing, filament testing and water immersion testing.  Manufacturing studies will be performed to verify compatibility with commercial scale manufacturing equipment. The design and manufacture of a small scale, batch plant will address technological and automation challenges.  This plant will provide a bridge to a commercial-scale plant designed to produce 6 million pounds of fiber yearly.  Additional innovative aspects to the project lie in the assessment of a bamboo species compatible with climates in the US, automation of raw bamboo processing, and implementation of a fully optimized multi-step material functionalization process.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will pursue the full development of a novel system design architecture for thermoelectric generation (TEG) to recover exhaust waste heat from engines and convert it to electricity.  The effort will build upon Phase I achievements, which included a successful feasibility demonstration of a fractional proof-of-concept prototype and development and validation of a computer model, thereby proving the viability of this new system technology platform.  The technology enables efficient performance within a very compact and cost-effective form that also can easily scale in capacity.  The Phase II effort will involve improving subsystems and designing, modeling, fabricating, and testing a full TEG system for a passenger car application.  Furthermore, scalability will be explored by applying the TEG to a larger vehicle platform.

    the broader/commercial impact of this project lie in the fact that industry has found it very challenging to develop a TEG system design that meets market metrics of performance, reliability, compactness, and low-cost, particularly for automotive applications.  The proposed TEG system architecture, which includes a novel exhaust gas heat exchanger uniquely integrated into the remaining system, shows strong potential for meeting such metrics, and thereby achieving significant reduction in vehicle fuel consumption and emissions.  By penetrating the large passenger vehicle market, initial market introduction could easily range in the 100,000s and much more if the cost of the product is extremely low.  Broader opportunities to recover exhaust waste heat for transportation include medium- and heavy-duty vehicles, which may also be addressed by this scalable technology.  Other adjacent markets include stationary and mobile generator sets, solid-oxide fuel cells, and potentially, aircraft propulsion systems.  This commercial impact would greatly support national energy independence and greenhouse gas reductions.

    the clinical and market need for an X-ray replacement technology that is portable,
    low-cost, and safe. While X-ray is the current dominant modality for diagnostic
    imaging of bone anatomy, it possesses many limitations: emission of radiation,
    bulky, and expensive. In the Phase I project, we demonstrated feasibility of the
    technology with a handheld ultrasound prototype, which demonstrated 3D freehand
    bone imaging using an ex vivo whole pig lumbar spine model. Phase II research
    objectives include: 1) Design and build a preproduction ultrasound prototype;
    2) Develop a model registration-based 3D bone imaging application and release
    a clinical software version with formal verification and validation testing; and
    3) Prepare the device for clinical use with human subjects and experimentally
    validate in an ex vivo porcine lumbar spine model with physician testing. It is
    anticipated that this project will result in the demonstration of a new medical
    device with demonstrated efficacy for improved administration of spinal anesthesia
    via 3D portable real-time spinal bone imaging. \n\nThe broader impact/commercial
    potential of this project is an X-ray replacement technology based on medical
    ultrasound, which addresses market segments including spinal anesthesia, orthopedic,
    and emergency medicine. Rivanna Medical is targeting the spinal anesthesia market
    first because of the compelling market and clinical need. Due to lack of availability
    of safe, portable, and inexpensive medical imaging for bone anatomy, these procedures
    currently exhibit high first-attempt failure rates. Failures result in poor patient
    outcomes and higher costs for health care providers. In this application, our
    lead device, the SpineFinder, would improve success rates via real-time guidance
    of spinal injections at the patient?s bedside. The societal impact of a safe,
    inexpensive, portable bone imaging products includes more successful procedures,
    better patient outcomes, and lower healthcare costs. Additionally, the public
    would benefit by an overall reduction in ionizing radiation exposure from X-ray
    and a subsequent reduction in cancers. The general scientific and technological
    understanding of acoustics will be enhanced through this project by a better understanding
    of ultrasound interactions with specular reflecting surfaces, such as bone."

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project enables an innovative high-productivity approach to manufacturing hard and brittle materials like ceramics, semiconductors, and glass. The objective of this proposal is to build on the successful Phase I feasibility study to demonstrate an efficient and productive method that could manufacture ceramic and semiconductors with excellent part quality. The process, termed Micro-Laser Assisted Machining (micro-LAM), allows a cheaper (~40-60%), faster (by two to five times), and better method of machining and manufacturing hard and brittle materials by combining the preferential heat from a laser source and extreme pressure from a diamond tool. The status quo technology for manufacturing these materials requires extensive machining hours to obtain good part quality, which is not economical. The demand for high-end ceramics and semiconductors is continuously increasing; however, high production costs have forced manufacturers to use other materials with inferior properties.  The goal of this effort is to address this unmet need by commercializing the micro-LAM technology by the end of Phase II. A minimum viable product will be tested at industrial partner sites to obtain firsthand customer feedback, which is key to accelerating the commercialization process.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be felt in semiconductor (microelectronics) manufacturing, optics (mirrors and windows), and precision mechanical products (bearing and seals), where the superior properties of advanced semiconductor and engineered ceramic materials are required to achieve performance criteria. This technology will enable entirely new capabilities for production of materials and products currently not viable or achievable due to processing limitations. The micro-LAM technology also has potential applications for emerging technologies, such as wind turbines and plug-in electric vehicles, where high-power and high-temperature operation of advanced devices is required. The current target market size, including optics, semiconductor, advanced ceramics and glass parts manufacturing, is approximately $250 million, with a 15%/year growth rate. Once market acceptance is established in the target market segment, the micro-LAM tooling will be launched into the larger diamond turning machine (DTM) market, with a total size of $2.4 billion.  There are approximately 10,000 DTMs in the United States alone (with ~ 500 new tools introduced per year).

    support the final development and commercialization of Symbios Technologies plasma
    treatment system to allow produced water in the oil and gas industry to be effectively
    treated, thereby allowing its safe discharge to surface waters or recycling to
    stimulate production in new wells, rather than being disposed of in injection
    wells. Produced water is the water brought to the surface, with or without hydraulic
    fracturing, along with the intended fuel products during extraction of oil, gas,
    and coal bed methane from formations underground. In general, produced water is
    contaminated with hydrocarbons, salts, and harmful microorganisms, meaning that
    it must be treated before it can be discharged or reused for agriculture and other
    purposes. This is an important environmental, public safety, and economic problem
    in the US. Research conducted during this project will be used to evaluate reactor
    improvements including process sensors and control systems, electrode geometries
    and surface coatings, degradation of contaminants in produced water, field testing,
    and techno-economic modeling. The anticipated technical results are that the Symbios
    plasma system will degrade hydrocarbon contaminants and kill microorganisms in

    proposed technology is based on an innovative, low-voltage plasma discharge that
    creates powerful oxidizing species for destroying biological and chemical contaminants

    emphasis on solving water contamination problems in the oil and gas industry,
    which was estimated to have a global market size of $45 billion in 2010, will
    result in a high likelihood for commercial success. The Phase II R&D plan will
    enhance scientific and technical understanding as well as commercial impact by
    addressing reactor improvements pertaining to corrosion resistance and automated

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will result in the continuing development of novel ultrafast, highly selective, high permeability ion-exchange fiber composites (IXFCs) for removing perchlorate from drinking water. The proposed material removes perchlorate 10-100 times faster than the best available technology and employs a low-cost production method compatible with widely available manufacturing equipment. Rapid contaminant removal is made possible by the use of micron-scale mass transfer distances; whereas commonly used beads and granular media are limited to much larger sizes resulting in drawbacks such as difficult containment and enormous pressure drops. However, IXFCs display both high permeability and self-containment due to their permanently intertwined, self-supporting structure. Serionix demonstrated the feasibility of this technology in Phase I and will continue in the Phase II with the following key goals: 1) optimization of ultra-high capacity IXFCs for perchlorate removal; 2) design/build IXFC purification cartridges for evaluation by industrial partners; 3) identify and validate chemistries for complimentary IXFCs that are selective for heavy metals such as lead and mercury; and 4) produce IXFCs at a pilot scale and develop strategy for commercial production.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this research is the development and commercialization of a low-cost technology enabling regulatory compliance and improved protection of human health. The first targeted application is perchlorate, which the EPA is set to regulate in drinking water by 2014. This represents only the first commercial opportunity for a platform technology with the ultimate potential to transform the industrial and residential water treatment landscape. Future applications may include ultrahigh efficiency water deionization, softening, and industrial wastewater recycling, personal protective equipment and clothing, and high activity solid acid/base catalysts. Dissemination of data and interpretation will contribute to improved understanding of mass transfer characteristics in fibrous sorbent materials used in both water and air treatment.

    This SBIR Phase II project aims to transform intravenous (IV) infusions of biologic medicines into simple subcutaneous (SC) injections. Biologics have improved the treatment of human disease. Unfortunately, their delivery is burdensome. The standard of administration of these biologics is often by IV infusion at low concentrations, which can take multiple hours to deliver, cause patient discomfort, and increase the risk of infection. Although SC injection is preferred, constraints on SC volume (1.5-2.0 mL) would necessitate concentrations much greater than 100 mg/mL, which are often unfeasible. Solutions at concentrations exceeding 100 mg/mL are highly viscous (honey-like), making them difficult to inject and leading to unstable products. This project's microparticle suspension technology can deliver high concentrations while fully preserving the protein structure, function, and efficacy. Transforming the delivery of biologics offers advantages to patients, healthcare providers, payers, and biopharmaceutical companies. Patients will experience less pain and discomfort, save time, have fewer infections, and have better access to biologics. Healthcare providers will be able to process more patients, decrease the chance of complications, and use fewer human resources. Payers will have decreased reimbursement costs. Biopharmaceutical companies will have patented product differentiation and the ability to develop otherwise intractable biologics.

    This SBIR Phase II project aims to develop a soft atomization manufacturing platform for the production of microparticle suspensions capable of transforming intravenous (IV) infusions of biologics into simple subcutaneous (SC) injections. The standard of administration of biologics is intravenous infusion at low concentrations, which can take hours to deliver, cause patient discomfort, and increase the risk of infection. Although SC injection is preferred, constraints on SC volume (1.5-2.0 mL) necessitate concentrations greater than 100 mg/mL, which are often unfeasible. Solutions at concentrations exceeding 100 mg/mL are highly viscous (honey-like), making them difficult to inject and leading to unstable products. This project's gently processed microparticle suspensions can deliver high concentrations while preserving protein structure and bioactivity, an accomplishment not well-demonstrated with other microparticle technologies. This project aims to advance the readiness level of the innovation by performing process calibration of a bench-scale system, followed by developing and characterizing the resulting particles and suspensions produced on that system. With well-formulated suspensions, in vivo pharmacokinetic and efficacy studies will commence. The project will support the development of manufacturing capabilities towards a goal of transitioning to pilot-scale production. This project aims to offer advantages to patients, healthcare providers, payers, and biopharmaceutical companies.

    This SBIR Phase II project focuses on creating scalable Virtual Learning Assistant technology for automatic educational assessments using open response questions. Educational researchers and experts believe that the best pedagogies responsible for improving students' learning outcomes involve (i) open response questions assessments and (ii) one-to-one instructional tutoring. Students learn better when they are given an opportunity to construct answers in their own words instead of selecting from multiple choices and when they receive immediate guidance and coaching. However, these two pedagogies are very time consuming and expensive to implement, making them very difficult to scale. The proposed project will apply the most advanced technologies such as Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing to solve both these problems. Students will benefit from the interactive formative assessment that engages them in a natural language conversation. This innovation is applicable across the grade levels in K-12, higher education, and adult learning and across the subject areas including the sciences. It will facilitate implementation of more rigorous academic standards and make online education more effective. This innovation will improve students' learning outcomes, save teachers' time and reduce the cost of delivering high quality engaging education at a large scale.

    This project will create a new type of virtual assistant technology that is exclusively focused on education. The proposed Virtual Learning Assistant (VLA) will advance the conversational AI technology to create pedagogically rich learning and assessment environments for any topic in a content area. The VLA is uniquely distinct from general purpose virtual assistants in its ability to evaluate an open response answer instead of merely serving information. This project will investigate and create various algorithms for processing natural language input arising in an educational setting across different subjects or topics. The resulting mobile and web based product will allow teachers to create new high-quality assessment items with minimal input and assign them to their students. When a student answers a question, the VLA will analyze it instantly for linguistic syntax and semantics using statistical and deterministic knowledge representations. The VLA will generate not only a numerical score reflecting the accuracy of the answer, but also a qualitative feedback that will guide the student towards conceptual mastery of the topic. As part of this Phase II research, a pilot study will be conducted each year involving teachers and students to study the efficacy of the VLA and its scalability.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to engineer loblolly pine to increase wood density (yield) by 20% with no additional land, water, or fertilizer use requirements.  With global demand for wood products expected to rise 60% by 2060, managed pine plantations will play a key role in helping to meet this need. By identifying and studying the genes that control plant development, particularly as they relate to cellulose (wood) production in the cell wall, the tree's natural ability to capture and utilize carbon dioxide (CO2) for more wood growth has been enhanced through genetic engineering. This technology will strengthen the United States' position as the leading producer and exporter of commercial wood products, i.e., pulpwood for paper, sawtimber for lumber, and wood pellets for fuel. Additionally, with advancements in the understanding of the pine genome, the work proposed here will stimulate the development of novel innovations in the field of forest genetics while the proposed genetically engineered seedlings help to address growing industry needs for commercial wood products.

    This SBIR Phase II project will develop a more efficient approach to engineering high wood density loblolly pine varieties. In contrast to traditional breeding, which has seen a modest 6% increase in wood density improvements over the past 20 years, this work proposes to increase wood density in pine by 20% through application of a directed, "gene trait" method to genetically engineer loblolly pine by altering secondary cell wall gene regulation. The proposed research will utilize a newly improved pine transformation protocol to scale up prototype production of tree seedlings designed with patent-pending, cell wall gene platform technologies. Also, this work establishes a pine engineering pipeline using germplasm adapted to different selective environments. This will streamline the production process while allowing for faster testing and development of technologies that improve growth traits in multiple growing regions. Specifically, plants engineered with this method will be tested for their long-term wood quality characteristics in both greenhouse and field trials. The goal of this project is to establish a commercial scale production program for loblolly pine engineered seedlings, and prepare for field testing and ultimately commercial sales of the cell wall platform technologies that have been developed.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to provide a solution to the problem of drinking water contamination by developing an advanced adsorbent for point-of-use/home filtration applications. Micropollutants, pharmaceutical residues, pesticides, industrial chemicals and other organic compounds present in water resources at trace concentrations of one part per billion and less, are recognized as a major factor of contamination. Consumers around the world no longer trust the safety of their drinking water due to the presence of micropollutants and other contaminants. These compounds are pervasive and can present toxicity at trace concentrations. As a result, consumers have significantly increased the non-sustainable use of plastic bottled water, now a $260 billion market. Current point-of-use filtration products are primarily designed to improve taste and odor, and are generally ineffective in removing micropollutants. CycloPure's technology has been developed specifically to target and remove micropollutants from water. This project focuses on the further development of the company's cyclodextrin adsorbent to improve the effectiveness of point-of-use filters. This material can be used as a drop-in replacement without changes in filter design. CycloPure's materials will allow households to safely use readily available tap water.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to identify strategies to develop a suitable form factor to incorporate CycloPure's high-affinity cyclodextrin adsorbent into point-of-use filters. The company's adsorbent is formed by reacting cyclodextrins, which are derived from corn starch, with readily available monomers in a single step process. During the Phase I period of this project, scalable reaction conditions were identified for production of the adsorbent in powder form. Flow-through applications, such as gravity filters, frequently require granular particles to achieve desired flow rates. Early activities will focus on the preparation of the adsorbent in granular form to demonstrate scalability and retention of removal performance similar to powder form. Thereafter, column studies will be performed in order to assess the removal performance of granular media under flow-through conditions at environmentally relevant micropollutant concentrations. Following identification of adsorption characteristics and appropriate flow conditions, a prototype point-of-use filter will be constructed and tested for the removal of micropollutants from tap water using advanced analytical techniques, including a combination of target and non-target screening approaches.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be substantial: a successful project would transform the construction industry, making it far more efficient by reducing legal conflicts, schedule slips and poor decision making. The proposed work will enable the fast and easy creation of 100% complete visual documentation of a physical space; this documentation can be generated many times throughout the course of construction. In so doing, the proposed project will allow professionals in the construction industry to track progress and communicate with their teams far more efficiently than ever before. A second outcome of the project will be the creation of vast, detailed, never before seen datasets of construction projects and real estate, allowing technical innovations in artificial intelligence and computer vision to impact one of the largest industries in the nation and the world. For example, systems could be trained to automatically spot safety concerns, augmenting the efforts of safety managers and keeping workers safer than ever before.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a fast, easy to use and cheap method to create photorealistic immersive models using off the shelf consumer hardware. Technical hurdles include validating the quality and efficacy of models generated with consumer hardware and automatic creation of routes through the 3D space without human annotation. Technical milestones involve using various sensor streams as well as other prior data to build these routes. With these hurdles cleared, advanced work may include automated analytics between and among 3D models of the same site captured over time. Because of the system's ease of use, it will enable the collection of large, totally novel datasets. The goal of the research is to produce a prototype that a layperson can use to create an immersive model of a physical site in order to document it with no annotation effort. The plan to reach these goals includes iterative software development against the hurdles listed above, as well as continuous user feedback to guide and refine development.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will continue development of cutting-edge nanopore technology that will greatly enhance biological preservation of regenerative medicines such as stem cells, complex tissues, and organs. Such a technology has the potential to greatly improve the biobanking and transport infrastructure of healthcare for on-demand cells and tissues, improved mass trauma care and advanced personalized medical procedures. Biopreservation is required in regenerative medicine at nearly all levels in the acquisition of source material, isolation, storage and shipment of a final product to patient. Yet critically, the field lacks the ability to safely and efficiently preserve these tissues and medicines while maintaining high cell viability and function after cryopreservation, severely limiting product shelf life. Nowhere is the absence of a biobanking technology more palpable than organ transplantation, where the time window between donor and recipient (4-7 hours) is not enough to properly match donations, screen for pathogens, or transport long distances. Enabling the United States to safely bank organs at subzero temperature will significantly enhance national healthcare. The US faces strong commercial and competitiveness reasons to invest in all facets of regenerative medicine, including organ therapies. Cryopreservation solutions would indirectly enable significant savings to the healthcare system, the patient, and healthcare insurance companies with the cost savings from regenerative medicine treatments estimated to be nearly $250 billion per year in the U.S.



    The cytotoxicity of current biopreservation techniques is largely associated with inefficient cryoprotective agent and water delivery across the cell membrane during cooling leading to irreparable cell damage from ice formation. Phase I established a fundamentally different approach to cryoprotective agent (CPA) optimization by developing first-in-the-field bioinspired nanopores as transmembrane mega highways to facilitate safe and efficient intracellular delivery and removal of cryoprotective agents during cryopreservation and dramatically increase post-thaw cell yield, viability, and function. The pore-formers assist CPA loading at reduced temperatures to make up the functional loss of biological protein channels at cold temperatures, reduce the amount of CPA required to remarkably low concentrations, and expand the selectable range of CPAs, all while dynamically dissociating at physiological temperature to prevent open-pore toxicity. Further R&D effort will diversify molecular design, optimize lead molecules, scale-up production, and perform cryopreservation studies on regenerative medicines of major therapeutic significance such as stem cells and complex tissues.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the development of a fluidic platform for selective bacterial and endotoxin removal from blood. This technology can potentially serve as a novel blood cleansing therapeutic for diseases such as sepsis. Sepsis is a life-threatening complication caused by infection. In the U.S., sepsis afflicts over 1.6 million annually and has an associated mortality rate ranging from 25-50%. Realization of this fluidic platform technology will address the broader societal needs of inhibiting sepsis progression and developing more specific and effective therapeutics for the treatment of human disease. Commercialization and implementation of the proposed innovation may reduce the hospital length of stay associated with sepsis, decrease sepsis morbidity and mortality rates, and potentially reduce the annual U.S. expenditure for sepsis. Scientific and technological understanding generated by this work has additional applications for other blood-borne diseases, such as HIV, leukemia, and Lyme disease. Ultimately, this technology will revolutionize life science research through inertial-based fluidic platform use, enabling new discoveries in cell/particle focusing phenomena and interactions that have profound implications for elucidating inertial focusing mechanisms and for the development of novel platform technologies.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes a novel approach to address the problem of sepsis through the direct removal of pathogens and associated toxins from circulation. Sepsis is the leading cause of death of the critically ill in the United States, costing over $24 Billion in treatment annually. The primary treatment for sepsis is system antibiotic administration, which is failing due to the rise of drug resistance and new, emerging pathogens. The research objectives of this project will result in an easy to use, efficient, and cost-effective fluidic platform for separation and removal of bacteria and associated toxins from circulation. This will facilitate the broad use of inertial-based fluidic platforms as research tools and for clinical applications, such as sepsis. The proposed research will 1) optimize fluidic platform design for clinical application, economical use, and workflow efficiency, 2) demonstrate efficient fluidic platform-mediated bacteria and endotoxin capture, and 3) confirm the biological benefits of the fluidic platform technology using a validated animal model of sepsis. Successful completion of these studies will demonstrate the positive biological consequences of direct pathogen and toxin removal from circulation and establish the commercial viability of the fluidic platform technology.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop an instrument platform that will facilitate development and translation of next generation diagnostics and therapeutics that are based on a class of nanovesicles called extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs, which are nanoparticles shed by cells, are being investigated for early detection of diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegenerative disorders, from biofluids without the need of invasive tissue biopsies. The lack of tools and techniques to perform high-throughput characterization of EVs is limiting translation. The platform under development will enable an understanding EVs produced by cells. The global market for nanoparticle analysis instrumentation in the life sciences is estimated at $5.9 Billion. The EV market, which is a subset of this market, is rapidly growing, with a predicted compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 47.3% over the next five years. Biological nanoparticles are playing an increasing role in life science applications and better, target-specific, faster tools are needed to characterize them in a high-throughput way.

    This SBIR Phase II project will complete the development of an instrument platform to enable Extracellular Vesicle (EV) measurements and characterization.  The platform will include a customer configurable consumable, eliminating the requirement for an expensive custom robotic arrayer step, removing barriers to end-user adoption and decentralizing discovery. Also, long-term shelf-life of the consumable will be established. In addition, improvements into the imaging platform will enable visualization of the smallest nanoparticles, relaxing the complexity and cost of the platform and providing a functional advantage over competitive offerings. The platform will automate much of the workflow, reducing operator hands-on time. The resulting platform will enable EV measurements with 5X-to-30X less sample volume, detect 100X-to-10,000X less concentrated targets, and increase throughput by using a workflow that bypasses purification requirements needed by other techniques. The completion of these objectives will result in a life science research tool for researchers and industry working on EV-based diagnostics and therapeutics.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to advance the use of engineered cell-based therapeutics in the human gut through the development of technologies for the reliable and reversible colonization of the gut with therapeutic bacterial strains. Engineered cellular therapeutics are poised to become the next major driver of pharmaceutical innovation due to their potential for sophisticated behavior and modular design. The gut is an ideal entry point for deploying engineered therapeutic cells, as it serves as our body's natural interface with foreign genetic material. A key impediment to bacterial drug development for the gut is the lack of strategies for achieving predictable colonization across the wide range of gut environments that patients can harbor. Furthermore, tools for on-demand clearance of therapeutic strains to ensure safety do not currently exist. The proposed innovation will overcome these challenges and allow the potential of engineered bacterial cells as therapies to be fully realized.

    This SBIR Phase II project will develop the technologies necessary to achieve predictable colonization of, and targeted clearance from, the human gut by engineered bacterial strains. Predictable colonization will be achieved through the use of a therapeutic strain that has been modified to consume a privileged prebiotic substrate that can be dosed alongside the strain to precisely control its abundance by giving it a competitive advantage. To ensure containment and enable targeted clearance, the therapeutic strain will be further modified such that it only can grow in environments where the prebiotic is present. This will allow for the generation of a robust synthetic niche within the gut that can be manipulated solely through the administration of this prebiotic control molecule. In addition, to enable the commercial deployment of these novel technologies, manufacturing protocols will be developed to ensure that a fully integrated therapeutic strain can be produced in sufficient quantities and stably formulated.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop engineered brewer's yeast to produce hop flavor compounds during beer fermentation, so as to replace the need for agriculturally produced hops.  Using agriculturally produced hops as a flavor component poses several challenges: 1) hops farming is natural resource intensive, 2) flavors imparted by hops are inconsistent from batch-to-batch, 3) lengthy agriculture timelines decouple demand from supply, and 4) new flavor varieties are restricted by slow and capital intensive hops breeding programs. This project establishes a product development framework for engineering brewer's yeast to produce flavor compounds during fermentation that are matched to consumer preferences. The technology developed during this project will allow for sustainable, consistent, on-demand production of hop flavors, and, in addition, may be extended to additional flavors and other fermentable products.

    This SBIR Phase II project will develop engineered brewer's yeast for production of flavor compounds that are ordinarily derived from hops. At present, the beer industry relies on agriculturally produced hops to impart organoleptically rich flavors and character to beer. Engineered yeast strains will serve as a drop-in replacement for conventional brewing strains, in that they both ferment beer and produce flavor compounds at concentrations desired in the finished beer. By applying an agile development framework towards yeast strain development, new brewer's yeast strains will be generated that produce flavor bouquets preferred by brewers and consumers. Genes that encode biosynthetic pathways for production of flavor compounds will be incorporated into brewer's yeast, and various gene regulatory programs will be tested that give rise to myriad flavor bouquets in finished beer. Strains will be initially evaluated in small-scale micro-aerobic fermentations and analyzed by GC/MS to screen for relevant flavor compound concentrations. Based on screening results, strains with desired target flavor compound concentrations will be used to produce beer at industrial pilot scale for evaluation by sensory analysis panels as a means of generating consumer feedback. This workflow will be deployed in an iterative fashion to optimize the performance of the hops flavor-producing brewer's yeast.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to allow more consumers to make use of assisted and autonomous driving systems in automobiles. Fully Autonomous Vehicles (AV) will reduce traffic collisions and enable humans to spend less time driving and more time on productive activities. Commercially deploying AVs requires a number of key technologies including sensing, perceptual systems, motion planning, and actuation. Our discussions with leaders and decisionmakers at automotive companies have shown that the development of robust, accurate, and energy-efficient perception systems is a major technical obstacle to creating mass-producible autonomous road vehicles. Of particular interest to automakers is scaling down the computational requirements of perceptual systems while preserving high levels of accuracy and robustness.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will use deep learning to create perception systems that are (a) scalable across different computational platforms and (b) scalable across smaller or larger sensor sets. Specifically, the company will develop scalable systems from small compute platforms (used for Highly Automated Driving) to somewhat larger compute platforms (used for Fully Automated Driving). Further, the company will develop perceptual systems that scale from few sensors to many sensors. The goal is to "do more with less," advancing the pareto-optimal frontier of efficiency-accuracy and price-accuracy tradeoffs. The company has already engaged with automotive OEMs and suppliers to develop partnerships and to define metrics for success in this endeavor.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project lies in its potential to develop a new mechanism for painlessly terminating atrial fibrillation.  Cardiac arrhythmia is one of the leading causes of death and debilitation.  A common means of terminating harmful rhythms is delivering a shock via an external or implantable defibrillator.  The pain from the shock is the number one concern for patients with implantable defibrillators, and because of the pain, an implantable option is not practical for atrial fibrillation.  The high-risk, high-reward research to be conducted under this project will significantly advance the field of defibrillation therapy and aims to lead to the introduction of a new class of implantable medical device technology.

    The proposed project seeks to develop and evaluate an implantable device that achieves non-destructive temporary conduction delay in cardiac tissues for the painless termination, and potentially prevention, of life threatening arrhythmias.  Cardiac arrhythmias are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the developed world. More than 1,000 Americans die each day from sudden cardiac arrest.  The team intends to initially target the development of a device to achieve rapid and painless termination of life threatening arrhythmias to treat atrial fibrillation. The successful development of the proposed device has the potential to benefit millions of patients.  Additionally, by virtue of its painless modulation of arrhythmogenesis, the proposed device may well also terminate incipient arrhythmias.  The phase II project will develop and evaluate a prototype system.  It is anticipated that the project will result in a new implantable medical device that painlessly terminates atrial fibrillation.

    The proposed project centers around further development on the world's smallest 2-way communications satellites and associated ground hardware. Key contributions of this project include system and networking optimization and validation of the technology through end to end demonstrations. The system optimization component will involve the development of system-level models that capture the complex interaction of all elements, including dynamics, constraints, and objectives. The network optimization component will focus on the development of algorithms that enable seamless communications scheduling as the network scales to several thousand devices on the ground.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project spans commercial, scientific and humanitarian applications by extending IoT (Internet of Things) connectivity to remote regions without cell coverage and where satellite data is prohibitively expensive for vital applications including agriculture, energy, shipping, and weather. The satellites and ground hardware being developed in this SBIR Phase II project have been driven towards miniaturization and power reduction to enable a broader range of customers to take advantage of the network by allowing easy integration into their devices and easy-to-install autonomous ground solutions.  The unique launch economics afforded by the miniaturized satellites enable IoT (Internet of Things) sensing and data return at a cost 1/10th to 1/100th that of incumbent satellite data providers.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to extend the function of windows by turning them into daytime sources of electricity. The target market for this technology is tall buildings in urban areas, where electricity demand is the highest and the available space for installing solar cells is smallest. This technology utilizes a window tint that can absorb sunlight and remit light of a certain color through the window's glass to small solar cells located at the edges. This technology hasn't been commercialized previously because most tint materials typically absorb their own emitted light, limiting efficiency. This project will provide a novel solution to these problems with a low-cost window tint material made from quantum dots. The work conducted in this project focuses on scaling up prototypes and optimization for cost and reliability. With this technology, tall buildings will approach net-zero energy consumption or even supply electricity to the grid. This would reduce the city's carbon footprint as well as save money for the companies/individuals occupying these buildings, which would increase their prosperity and welfare. This technology would also reduce pollution by limiting the amount of burned fossil fuels needed to generate electricity. 

    The proposed project develops and scales up the electricity-generating window prototypes to the square meter size, validates long-term reliability, optimizes for manufacturing, and launches pilot projects. The technology is based on luminescent solar concentrators, which are made by tinting a window with a fluorophore material that partially absorbs sunlight and then converts it to fluorescence, preferably in the near-infrared. The fluorescence is trapped inside the window by total internal reflection and is concentrated to the edges where small solar cells efficiently convert that light into electricity. Utilizing this technology in windows to generate electricity has not been commercialized due to unsuitable fluorophores. The fluorophore used in this project are quantum dots composed of CuInSeS/ZnS, which solves the problems of previous materials. Traditional fluorophores like dyes typically have strong self-absorption, narrow spectral absorption, and poor stability. Quantum dots are more stable, but are expensive, sometimes toxic (due to heavy metals), and also suffer from self-absorption. The breakthrough in CuInSeS/ZnS quantum dots is that they are significantly cheaper, avoid toxic elements, have near-infrared fluorescence optimal for low-cost commercial solar cells, and do not self-absorb. At the conclusion of the phase II project, prototype products will be installed in at least one building.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project will be to develop a new tool to safely and nondestructively deliver genes and other materials into large numbers cells at the same time. New forms of therapies for cancer and other intractable diseases take advantage of a patient's own cells, re-engineered in the laboratory to target a tumor or other diseased tissue. However, generating these cells is currently inefficient, slow, and expensive. Patient-derived cells resist transfection using standard non-viral biochemical approaches of lipid delivery systems, cell-penetrating peptides, and high-voltage electroporation, requiring an engineering alternative. The proposed technology provides a safe, turnkey, and scalable technology with a potential transformative impact in research and life sciences laboratories and companies, representing a high-growth and high-value market opportunity.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes a new nanomaterial delivery system to introduce reprogramming agents into immune cells efficiently and with low cell toxicity. This project will examine how the proposed nanostraw design, transfection protocol, and cell preparation improves immune cell delivery efficiency, and optimize the process to achieve >50% transfection efficiency with primary immune cells. Market analysis has found this level of transfection efficiency would be transformative to researchers and clinicians using primary immune cells. The transfection protocol will be optimized and codified into a simple to follow set of instructions. A turn-key instrument will be developed to carry out these procedures for use by life science researchers, with reduced device costs through improved manufacturing techniques to be competitive with currently available methods. The market-ready product will be evaluated by eight preclinical immune cell research beta sites to discover new treatment pathways.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is developing a safe and sustainable ink for
    the global ink industry. Approximately nine billion pounds of ink is produced
    annually around the world.  Currently, ink is predominantly made of petroleum
    or inorganic chemicals mined from the earth. For example, carbon black is commonly
    used in traditional ink, which is derived from petroleum, not biodegradable, and
    toxic for humans. To solve this problem, nature has produced a multitude of molecules
    capable of replacing pigments currently utilized in ink. While many organisms
    that produce these alternatives are slow growing and require energy sources like
    sugar, photosynthetic microbes, such as cyanobacteria, are capable of being engineered
    in an efficient manner to produce pigments in ink formulations that are safe,
    renewable, and 100% biodegradable. This ink will be used by businesses for printing
    packaging, marketing material, and other printed products. Developing and integrating
    these ink products will decrease significantly the overall detrimental impact
    of traditional inks on the environment, and more importantly, human health. \n\nThis
    SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop sustainable ink formulations using cyanobacteria
    as feedstock for producing optically black pigments for printing inks. This project
    will also engineer cyanobacteria cells capable of generating cellular pigments
    for a color spectrum of cyan, magenta, and yellow. These colored cyanobacteria
    will act as pigments that replace mined pigments found in traditional ink formulations,
    such as carbon black and cadmium. This project is developing a unique process
    in which extraction of pigments/dyes is not necessary, thus saving energy and
    reducing cost.   Using cyanobacteria cells as pigments creates a renewable source
    of biomass for bio-products, as these organisms leverage sunlight, carbon dioxide,
    wastewater and land otherwise unsuitable for conventional agriculture to rapidly
    generate biomass. In addition to the development of colorful renewable cyanobacteria
    strains, this project will focus on manufacturing thousands of pounds of ink products
    for testing and consumer use as well as testing the applicability of these natural
    pigments to act as colorants in the food and textile industries.\n\nThis award
    reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
    evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
    criteria."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project has the potential to help enhance disease resistance in poultry and increase yields due to the delivery of only healthy, fully vaccinated chicks to farms. These healthier chicks will reduce the need for antibiotics in poultry, aiding to combat antimicrobial resistance.  This technology has immediate applications in other food animal industries and fisheries, and allows for data capture on numbers of animals and types of treatments given. Broader applications would include any image capture and analysis that relies on analytics to identify target areas for delivery of substances to live animals or humans.


    This SBIR Phase II project will allow for the advancement and commercialization of imaging technologies for the use of screening and targeting live animals. This proposal brings innovation in the care of food animals allowing for producers to move away from flock health and focus on the care of individual animals. This will be a dramatic change for the poultry industry, but is necessary in the face of antibiotic removal to be able to improve the current vaccination efficiencies and screen chicks for health status. Individualized care is currently not possible due to the high throughput needed to keep pace with large scale commercial hatchery operation. The technical challenges this proposal will overcome include 1) the safe and effective handling of chicks in an automated system that can process 100,000 chicks per hour, 2) the development of imaging systems for health checks and target recognition, 3) the delivery of the appropriate dose of vaccine with the correct amount of agents (virus, bacteria, parasite, and other agents) while not damaging the agents during delivery, and 4) development of a system that is rugged and robust enough to survive in a hatchery environment.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to provide quick and cost-effective access
    to anyone seeking cutting-edge, electromagnetic, simulation tools for research
    and development. This will involve automating the most technically intensive tasks
    required to accurately, reliably, and efficiently design and prototype photonic
    and optoelectronic devices. Current simulation tools require everything to be
    set up by hand which, even for trained experts, is time consuming and error prone.
    Also, the computational design and prototyping of photonic devices involves too
    much trial and error. Our turn-key, on-demand, cloud platform will: (1) reduce
    design time by 50%, (2) lower the unit cost of simulations by an order of magnitude,
    and (3) enable first-time users with no prior training in electromagnetic simulations
    to get up and running with manufacturing-ready designs in a matter of weeks not
    months. Our advanced simulation tools will facilitate enterprises and entrepreneurs
    with bringing products to market in a variety of industries critical to national
    security, health, and education. Easy-to-use and affordable design tools will
    also reduce the need to fabricate and test as many iterations thereby conserving
    environmental resources. This is the next generation of computer-aided design
    (CAD) tools to accelerate photonics innovation and discovery. \n\nThe proposed
    project involves the development of a turn-key, electromagnetic, simulation platform
    which automates complex, multi-step tasks involved in the design and prototyping
    of photonic and optoelectronic devices. Photonics, the science of light, underlies
    critical technologies in telecommunications, networking, photovoltaics, biomedicine,
    photolithography, imaging, displays, and solid-state lighting. Phase II involves
    automating the deployment of finite difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations
    in four key areas: (1)large-scale shape optimization for devices involving tens
    to hundreds of degrees of freedom, (2) sensitivity analysis to assess the impact
    on device performance of manufacturing errors and predicting manufacturing yields,
    (3) launching simulation jobs using on-demand, scalable, high-performance computing
    (HPC) in the public cloud, and (4) seamlessly importing and exporting planar device
    geometries based on the standard Graphic Database System (GDSII) file format widely
    supported by electronic design automation (EDA) tools and semiconductor foundries.
    This will be made possible by combining advances in machine learning, nonlinear

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the development of software and monitoring system for the conservation of water resources and the economic sustainability of agricultural crop producers. Agricultural production uses a great deal of water. In California alone, 80% percent of all water usage goes to agriculture. As communities expand and drought conditions develop, the competition for scarce and expensive water resources has become intense. Growers need to minimize costs and water needs by making their irrigation practices more efficient. While new irrigation application technologies have reduced losses from wind drift, leakages and evaporation, large amounts of water are still be wasted as it washes through the soil past crop roots. The technology developed in this project will allow producers to track soil moisture movement through the soil profile and across fields. This will allow producers to develop irrigation strategies based on the unique conditions of their soil types and topography and reduce water waste. It will save producers money and enable them to stay in business and meet new governmental regulations regarding irrigation. Improvements in water management efficiencies and better crop management practices can increase crop production and uniformity, reduce food costs, and help preserve the environment.

    This SBIR Phase II project addresses priority challenges currently facing growers, producers, and agricultural scientists in effectively using water for crop (food) production. Soil and crop scientists have been examining the need for acquiring higher resolution moisture and temperature data throughout the root zone and across the landscape. A science-based approach is needed to optimally determine the number, location, and depths of sensors to accurately measure, and then model, soil properties for use in precise, effective and efficient water and crop management. Moreover, for perennial crops such as wine grapes, there also is a need to develop models and predictions relating these environmental conditions and historical data to crop quality and volume as well as long-term tree/vine health. The proposed technology uses novel visual analytics to organize the resulting massive data flows and novel predictive models to allow stakeholders to perform precision management of crops based on soil moisture conditions and other field conditions that have not been possible to date.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to establish a broadly applicable, breakthrough biocatalytic technology to produce an important class of compounds called chiral cyclopropanes.  Cyclopropanes are key intermediates that are used in the synthesis of drugs, crop protection agents, and high-value electronic chemicals. Products accessible using this technology have markets totaling more than $10 billion annually. If successful, the technology under development will create safer, cleaner, more sustainable routes to important chemical products that will lower cost by reducing the number of production steps, lowering the required capital investment, significantly decreasing waste. Replacing existing chemical routes with the more efficient and sustainable enzyme-catalyzed steps will also improve the purity of many advanced pharmaceutical intermediates used in the manufacture of drugs and crop protection chemicals.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to build on the results from Phase 1 in which a highly efficient biocatalytic process for the manufacture of the drug ticagrelor was developed using a novel, engineered enzyme. We will create an expanded set of cyclopropanation biocatalysts with the capability to act on a wider range of starting materials, thereby broadening the scope and utility of this new enzymatic reaction. We will complete the development and commercialization of the process for production of the key intermediate for ticagrelor and initiate work to develop novel biocatalysts to produce ley intermediates for anti-viral drugs. We will also develop and commercialize a set of enzymes that can be used by drug discovery chemists to establish efficient routes for next-generation drugs.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will result from greatly improving mobile app user experience, boosting developer productivity, and speeding up mobile innovations by automating the mundane and simplifying the complex in Android app testing.  Apps are now everywhere.  They innovate almost every industry.  By making it easy to build high-quality apps, users enjoy better experience and developers enjoy better productivity, benefiting every industry and person that use apps.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to modernize the software development process by combining both program analysis research breakthroughs and big data technologies. Toward this vision, this project aims to build a unique product with innovative technologies to help developers automatically test Android apps. The product continuously tests apps across code changes to detect issues such as performance regressions, crashes, and memory leaks, as soon as problematic code is introduced. In contrast, existing tools often alert developers too late, after real users have been affected and many code changes have been merged, making it both stressful and difficult to find the problematic code. The proposed product gives actionable diagnosis by pinpointing what problematic code developers need to fix and explaining the why and how of the fix. It is thus much more intelligent and easy to use than existing tools.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in providing state-of-the-art tools allowing anyone to build and deploy domain specific commercial intelligent virtual assistant (IVA) solutions. These tools allow others to understand how IVAs should be architected and integrate IVA technology into their offerings. IVAs have shown promise in numerous commercial domains including financial services, healthcare, education, law enforcement, and retail, to name a few, reducing the barrier to knowledge access within domains by providing a medium for people to converse naturally with sophisticated computer and information systems.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will address the significant technological challenges involved when scaling the domains and capabilities of an Intelligent Virtual Assistant (IVA). This project will innovate in designing scalable artificial intelligence models capable of learning and identifying hundreds or thousands of learned concepts, and designing the accompanying system architecture to support the growing compute demand of sophisticated algorithms. Specifically, the project aims at achieving: (1) Scalable Intelligence: the ability to handle hundreds or thousands of competencies and extractable semantic concepts, allowing users to interact with the system with unbounded, unconstrained language; (2) Customizable Intelligence: the ability to allow customers to (semi-) automatically train and (re)train and customize the intelligence on demand (adding new competencies, identifying new slot-value pairs, modify responses); (3) Conversational Complexity: support multi-turn conversations, where the context from prior utterances is used to refine and understand what the end-user is trying to accomplish; and (4) Scalable System Infrastructure: enhance open source IVA software infrastructure to seamlessly scale up and down the computational resources allocated for each intelligence engine based on load.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is the development of novel high-brightness fluorescence compounds (fluorophores). These compounds will find applications in flow cytometry, a laser-induced fluorescence technique that can analyze thousands of cells per second. This efficient technique is important for clinical diagnosis, and research in the areas of blood cancer, STEM cells, and drug development. In a flow cytometry test, each cell structure is stained with a known fluorophore that is conjugated with a specific biomarker. Thus, the population of all cell structures and types can be determined simultaneously by analyzing the fluorescence signals. Unfortunately, such analysis requires experienced engineers, reliable equipment, and high-performance reagents. The proposed high-brightness fluorophores will enhance the performance of equipment and reagents, and enable the detection of low abundant cell structures without complicated signal processing. In addition, these fluorophores will improve data reliability, reduce research and drug development time, and cost. These compounds also will simplify the design and reduce the cost of flow cytometry equipment, which will help to expand market adoption. The commercial impact of this technology is expected to be significant, as the market size for flow cytometry is expected to be $2.2 billion by 2018.

    This STTR Phase II project aims to establish a platform technology for the production of high-brightness fluorophores that can emit in various colors. In principle, flow cytometry could simultaneously detect up to 30 different parameters with 30 color signals. However, due to the issues of spillover (signal overlap), and auto-fluorescence (background noise), the current technology allows for just two- to eight-color analysis to ensure accuracy. These issues could be resolved in part by a complicated signal analysis, but this approach may be prone to analysis errors. The proposed high-brightness fluorophores are designed to overcome spillover by increasing the weak signals of low abundance cells. In addition, these fluorophores also may reduce or eliminate the need of autofluorescence background compensation by increasing the signal to noise ratios. A higher signal to noise ratio will enable scientists to obtain well-resolved data with more accurate conclusions within a shorter amount of time. This technology will allow the detection and sorting of low abundance cells, and will promote the progress of immunology studies, cancer research, as well as technology for early disease detection. This will enabling flow cytometry equipment to be used to its full potential for reliable multi-color detection, which will lead to better patient and research outcomes.

With the appropriate tools, daylighting is arguably one of the most cost-effective methods of achieving high performance buildings (and happier, healthier occupants) throughout the design process. World-wide green building is expected to double every three years. The world's green building market is a trillion-dollar industry, moreover, the green building materials market is expected to reach $234 billion by 2019. By 2018, green construction will directly contribute 1.1 million jobs and $75.6 billion in wages by 2018 in the United States. Between 2015 and 2018, LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certified buildings in the United States are estimated to have $1.2 billion in energy savings. Green buildings use fewer energy and water resources; save money for families, businesses and taxpayers; reduce carbon emissions; and prioritize environmental and human health.


    This projects proposes to create robust software for measuring, analyzing, and for recommending solutions to glare in buildings. A novel dynamic tree parallelization architecture is proposed to manage complex, dynamic, and massive amounts of lighting calculations. This will include building the first commercial grade 3 and 5 phase lighting analysis engine. It will also produce a new generation artifact for creating and manipulating data for glare analysis. It will conclude with a validation study.

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase II project will provide an engaging independent-learning
    platform which weaves science into an exciting story for ages eight to thirteen.
    The platform combines a time-travel adventure game, a complementary book, and
    in-game avatars for important scientists (like Albert Einstein) that can answer
    students' questions.  It is aimed at the need for educating more science and engineering
    professionals by tapping into children's strong interest in games to augment current
    science curricula that students often find boring and uninteresting. The story
    is about STARDUST (atoms) and its formation and history in the universe.  It engages
    students by taking them back in time to identify trillions of atoms they personally
    inherited from Einstein and the last T-Rex.  Besides school use, the game's independent
    learning and engagement allows distribution directly to children for recreational
    use, adding another avenue for science learning, and a sustainable business model
    for the Company through school and commercial sales.  The technology can also
    support independent learning in underperforming schools. The development of the
    scientist avatar artificial intelligence technology will have wide application
    for many other educational and training requirements.  \n\nThe innovation is a
    unique platform for independent learning about the sweeping science saga of atoms
    during the history of the Universe and Earth, and the connection of each student
    to that history through the trillions of atoms they inherited from prior beings
    like Albert Einstein and the last T-Rex.  The platform combines video games, a
    complementary fictional story book (based on the science) that acts as game introduction
    and player guide, and in-game avatars (like Albert Einstein and Henrietta Leavitt)
    that can provide verbal answers to students' spoken questions.  The artificial
    intelligence backing the scientist avatars includes learning manager software
    that guides student learning and provides assessments of progress in achieving
    pre-established learning goals. Four players cooperate in time travel adventures,
    exploring the human body, the Earth, and the Universe to find out what STARDUST
    is (atoms), how and when it was created (in the Big Bang and supernovae), how
    it got into Einstein, and from him to others (e.g., the carbon cycle). Excellent
    test results for the Phase I prototype game suggests a successful start at creating
    good player engagement. The project will continue to combine learning and engagement
    in 10 additional episodes with new scientist avatars including female and minority
    scientists."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project stems from addressing the
    important hand gesture based input challenges of VR/AR (expected to grow to $150B by
    2020), Robotics and IoT ($135B by 2019 and $1.7T by 2020 respectively). This technology,
    if successful in mitigating the high technical risks, represents a huge leap in the state of the
    art in 3D hand models for gesture recognition and has the potential to be the industry
    standard for AR, VR, Robotics and IoT applications with broad societal impact in education,
    medical and healthcare. Its broader impact is further amplified by the potential in serving the
    needs of the disabled community in improving their quality of life by being better able to
    communicate, learn and adapt to their interaction needs.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase 2 project aims to significantly
    advance current 3D hand gesture recognition technology by developing a dynamic hand
    tracking model for gesture intent recognition. It is robust against occlusion and tolerant to
    variations in camera orientation and position. This research will result in a transformative
    leap above the current state of academic and commercial hand models and overcome key
    technical hurdles that have so far proven difficult to overcome. It solves the following key
    challenges and involves very high technical risks: 1) robust hand tracking while holding
    objects and 2) robust tangible interactions using objects without using any fiducial markers
    2) low profile hand wearable for touch interaction detection. This Phase 2 project will
    achieve these objectives by 1) data acquisition and hand-object pose estimation, 2)
    understanding user intents with enhanced tangible interactions, and 3) system validation
    and user testing.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase II project, if successful, will be to demonstrate the potential
    of the technology to dramatically reduce the cost and risk currently associated
    with production of bio-based products, enabling ultra-low cost product development.
    The field of metabolic engineering historically has been limited in predicting
    the behavior of complex biological systems in vivo from simplified models and
    basic in vitro biochemical principles. In many cases, it has proven much more
    difficult than expected to integrate a well characterized production pathway into
    a living host and balance the complex requirements of both biomass growth and
    production. The technology under development is a first of its kind, truly scalable,
    high-throughput metabolic engineering platform enabling the rapid development
    of microbial production strains. This significant reduction in development cost
    enables the possibility to produce numerous specialty products that would otherwise
    not have acceptable internal return on development capital. \n\nThis SBIR Phase
    II project will develop a high throughput metabolic engineering platform that
    enables the rapid development of microbial production strains. The platform, which
    bridges a gap between current in vivo and in vitro bio-production approaches,
    relies on the dynamic minimization of the active metabolic network in the context
    of a standardized two-stage bioprocess. Metabolic networks are highly interconnected
    wherein each metabolite and/or enzyme can interact with endless others. This combinatorial
    complexity results in a huge potential design space, which is intractable to the
    kinds of systematic experimentation required for the development of standardized
    design principles. The global challenges in addressing such a large biological
    design space have persisted, despite the dramatic advances in, and decreased costs
    of, reading and writing DNA, high-throughput DNA assembly, and microbial strain
    construction approaches. Dynamic metabolic network minimization not only results
    in a design space with greatly reduced complexity, but also provides strains that
    are robust to environmental conditions. Robustness leads to predictable scalability
    from high-throughput small-scale screens or \"microfermentations\" to fully instrumented
    bioreactors. This project will extend the validation of predictable strain performance
    from high-throughput microfermentation to pilot scale fermentation."

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project, if successful, will be the development of a
    microbial process for the economical and sustainable production of a highly potent
    natural acaricide, which is a pesticide that kills mites and ticks.  Increasing
    wariness of synthetic insecticides combined with the need to prevent tick-borne

    its commercialization has been hampered by a high cost of production. The aim
    is to develop an alternative manufacturing process for biosynthetic production
    enabling the cost reductions required to effectively penetrate the $1.6 B acaricide
    market. Because the target is GRAS and because it has been used extensively as
    a food ingredient for decades, there is a compelling safety benefit combined with
    its potent efficacy, which may spur increased spraying in public areas and private

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop a platform technology for point of care (POC) detection of disease biomarkers present in low concentrations in bodily fluids. This technology can greatly impact the current standard medical workflow by reducing the time-to-results from days or weeks to 15 minutes, allowing for disease screenings during routine doctors visits supporting early diagnosis and improved treatment monitoring. It will promote preventative care, and therefore lead to improved treatment outcomes, patient satisfaction, and reduced healthcare costs. This technology will be incorporated into a portable, low-powered device that can be operated in-the-field, in low-resource settings in the US and internationally, supporting better healthcare monitoring that is often absent in under-served segments of society. The first target application is the detection of liver cancer, a disease that, when diagnosed late, has an extremely high mortality rate and cost of treatment. The proposed system may aid in the screening and early diagnosis of liver cancer. Furthermore, due to the technology?s inherent potential for multiplexing, it may be possible to simultaneous detect multiple biomarkers for chronic liver disease (Hep B, C, and cirrhosis), increasing its applicability to a global patient pool of over 500 million patients.

    Medicine is increasingly focused on personalized and preventative care and hence there is an increasing demand for diagnostic tools that can facilitate rapid screening, diagnosis, and treatment monitoring. Most current POC tests on the market are lateral flow based and do not target high sensitivity applications like cancer biomarkers, which require quantitative results and are present in low concentrations in blood. The goal of this Phase II project is to develop a standalone diagnostic system consisting of a portable reader and disposable cartridges to rapidly diagnose hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) via the quantitative detection of AFP. During year 1, a 20-sensor very-high frequency (VHF) biochip will be designed and fabricated, simultaneously the whole blood processing component of the cartridge will be developed and integrated to form an all-inclusive cartridge. A distributed standalone electronic system will also designed and tested in year 1. Year 2 will involve the integration of the reader components to form a standalone system, additionally the all-inclusive cartridge will modified to interface with the reader allowing for plug and play operation. The performance of the integrated system will be evaluated via detection of HCC biomarkers in registry samples and comparison to the current standard of care.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to enable significant improvement in the shelf-life of unstable natural food ingredients and enable replacing artificial with natural colors in a large portfolio of products of interest to the food and beverage industries. Consumer demand for all-natural ingredients in food has increased multifold, primarily due to health concerns. Despite the strong consumer demand, delivery and stability of natural food colors pose a great challenge for the food and beverage industry. This challenge results due to an inherent chemical instability of natural ingredients and due to their accelerated degradation during food processing and storage. But the current solutions are not cost-effective and require the use of synthetic additives and preservatives, which are not desired by the consumers. This project is aimed at providing an array of low-cost, stable natural ingredients that will improve the overall stability of the finished products both during food processing and storage. This will also address the unmet societal needs for healthy food ingredients and improving sustainability of food products.

    This SBIR Phase II project aims to develop bio-based encapsulation solutions to improve natural food color and phytochemical stability in food and beverage products. Current solutions are sub-optimal providing limited pH (color), heat or oxidative stability and short expiration dates on food and beverage products. To address this unmet need, this project aims to develop encapsulation of natural colors and bioactives that will enhance the overall stability of a finished food product. This will be achieved by working on the primary objectives of this project: Selection and screening of the carriers and natural ingredients to be encapsulated, physico-chemical stability testing of the encapsulated ingredients, scale-up methodologies, stability testing in a finished food/beverage product, consumer evaluation and customer validation of the formulations. As a result of the proposed approach, solutions will be provided that will allow the food and beverage industry to replace artificial with natural colorants as well as significantly extend shelf-life of their desired food products. This will also benefit the consumer who is seeking natural health-promoting ingredients in what he/she consumes.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is through providing a wearable alcohol monitoring device to the general population which will lead to a better awareness about alcohol consumption, and ultimately enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce burden of illness and disability. Incautious alcohol use causes health and social problems that either manifest over time due to sustained drinking (e.g., heart disease, cancer, liver disease, diabetes, etc.), or are short term effects of acute intoxication and/or impaired decision-making (e.g., motor vehicle crashes, violence, etc.). Excessive alcohol use led to approximately 88,000 deaths per year in the United States from 2006-2010 and in 2006 alone cost the economy approximately $224 billion. In light of the above social impact, the proposed graphene based wearable alcohol monitoring device addresses the urgent need to implement health approaches to reduce the loss of life and the huge economic costs that result from excessive drinking. In fact, the growing need for personalized health-care is highlighted by the estimated market size of $19 billion for wearable biosensors by 2018, pointing towards the potential commercial opportunity for self-monitoring alcohol sensors as well.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project addresses the unmet need for a small, light, unobtrusive, convenient-to-use alcohol sensor for real-time self-monitoring of alcohol consumption. Excessive alcohol consumption is a health risk behavior and the fourth leading preventable cause of death in the United States. Most strategies to improve safe drinking rely on obtaining accurate and timely information about alcohol consumption; these include self-report of number and timing of drinks, breathalyzers, blood analysis by lab, and wearable devices. Wearable alcohol monitors have clear advantages in terms of accuracy and feasibility compared to other methods for self-monitoring. However, current wearable devices for alcohol monitoring are bulky, inconvenient to use, obtrusive, and do not provide consistent, real-time data on the level of intoxication. In this Phase II SBIR project, a stand-alone graphene nanoelectronic transdermal alcohol sensor integrated with calibration electronics and Bluetooth transceiver will be developed, tested and benchmarked on a large group of recruited adult volunteers. Good correlation between the graphene sensor and a legal grade breathalyzer in large-scale human tests will confirm the technical and commercial feasibility of the proposed sensors, which can then be shipped to early adopters, pitched to investors, and ultimately introduced for sales.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to empower farmers to capture a greater share of revenue from the marketing of their crops.  Agriculture is a significant engine to the U.S. economy, and farming itself is vital to creating economically vibrant rural areas.  Farmers are often at a disadvantage when it comes to capturing good prices from their crops because there are significant information asymmetries in the marketing supply chain.  We have developed a combination of hardware and analytics that greatly improves crop forecasts at dramatically more accessible prices, which allows farmers and their trusted buyers to make more informed marketing decisions.  Whereas improved agronomy could raise yields by 5-10%, improved marketing could raise revenue >25%, especially for high value crops.  In addition to the narrow application of sensing hardware and analytics for forecasting, the data collected by our platform can also be used by growers to make decisions that improve operational performance of complex agribusinesses and improve the agronomy of the farm. These tools make it easier to compare performance of crops to improve yields and reduce resource costs.  Together this technology continues to raise productivity and profitability per farmer.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project integrates a completely novel plant and weather sensing platform with analytics that synthesizes data into actionable forms that can drive agribusiness decisions.  We have bundled a suite of capabilities into a single hardware unit that includes sensing, communications, GPS, mounting, and solar power, which dramatically reduces the cost and increases the simplicity of collecting agricultural data.  These data are uniquely designed to monitor crop performance and its sensitivity to weather and management.   Data synthesis is a critical pain point in transforming raw numbers into insights for growers to act upon. By creating an integrated hardware platform, the data is poised to provide useful advice that allow a farmer to act on emerging situations, anticipate upcoming events, and even predict the future.  Our research objective here will be to generate probabilistic forecasts that use the unique data from our hardware to estimate key crop growth parameters and project forward for an operational yield forecast.  This coupling between highly informative quantitative in-field data and sophisticated parameter estimation and forecast techniques could dramatically improve marketing decisions and help farmers capture better prices for their products.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in improving the performance of the computational back-end of a display system that delivers personalized information in public spaces. Currently, the primary method for an individual to receive customized information in public spaces is through personal devices. The heavy use of personal devices in public often leads to heads-down, isolating, and even hazardous situations. The delivery of personalized information through infrastructure can significantly improve these issues. However, the bandwidth requirements in doing so have been prohibitively high using standard computational architectures. This project aims to improve the performance of such a system, allowing practical applications that will broadly enhance safety, accessibility, transportation, and other areas.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on creating a scalable computational pipeline and architecture that will allow a display system to direct personalized visual information in real-time to large numbers of people. Technically, this involves computing, transmitting, and displaying image data for large crowds in parallel. The architecture takes advantage of the inherent redundancies in this application to provide a cost-effective solution. The goal of the project is to create a computational back-end capable of driving, in real-time, a system equivalent to thousands of displays.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the development of a software platform for the engineering of living systems. Specifically, it will complete a software ecosystem that builds upon a core set of computational tools for the specification, design, build, test, analyze, and archive activities in synthetic biology and couple them with a rich set of interfaces to expert services (e.g., DNA synthesis, data analysis). The proposed work involves the completion of state-of-the-art design approaches and algorithms and couples it with the ability to create customized, modular workflows based on genetic circuit design, metabolic pathway modification, and genome engineering. The proposed work advances computational approaches in synthetic biology as well as innovating in the way that software services are monetized with biotechnology companies. The anticipated result of this work is a commercial software package and associated service agreements that can be deployed to both large and small biotechnology companies fundamentally changing the way that synthetic biology designs are conceived, designed, and physically created.

    This SBIR Phase II project will develop a software platform where the goal is to combine bio-design automation (BDA) software with explicitly integrated access to expert services in a workflow-driven software ecosystem.  The creation of novel living systems using biotechnology to engineer new medicines, materials, and fuels is frequently an ad-hoc process involving long iteration cycles, wasted resources, and sub-optimal designs. The software will allow for the automated specification, design, fabrication, test, and archival of complete plans for the engineering of novel engineered biological systems. This software includes mechanisms for specifying biological "rules," DNA assembly strategies, and automated generation of robotic instructions.  In particular, this effort will focus on the creation of genetic circuits, engineered metabolic pathways, and genome engineering.  The approach provides tools representing state-of-the-art advances in BDA while introducing novel methods of interacting with a large, diverse set of expert service providers. Further, the approach will empower novice experimentalists while enabling expert computational engineers.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to address a strong commercial and scientific need for operational synthesis of spatially consistent and temporally relevant historical and current high resolution satellite imagery for analytical purposes. The technology will contribute to the advancement of scientific knowledge especially in the geospatial arena and to market spillovers. By dramatically simplifying access to accurate imagery for any time and place, this technology will provide companies, researchers, educators, students, and regular citizens with a valuable tool for visualizing and exploring our changing planet and will contribute to increasing public engagement with science and technology. Further, the analytical capabilities offered by the imagery have great potential in scientific applications thus contributing to partnerships between academia and industry and improving datasets for research and education. Finally, this technology will be valuable in operational settings at the large providers of commercial satellite imagery, to individual users, and enable a wide variety of new visualization, analysis, and data mining applications. The examples of commercial applications for the technology are virtual earth, insurance and reinsurance, agriculture, emergency, change detection.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will operationally synthesize accurate regional-to-global, high spatial / high temporal satellite imagery of the Earth. The technology will utilize advanced data fusion algorithms to combine various sources of imagery while preserving the best spatial and temporal attributes of the data sources. The complexity of accessing, processing, and analyzing various sources of satellite imagery creates a significant barrier to its use. Synthesis of regionally and globally continuous high spatial / high temporal resolution imagery is a challenge as in addition to inherent differences in spatial and temporal resolutions of the source data, the new models need to account for enormous data volumes and sparse coverage of high spatial resolution imagery. Existing techniques to handle these challenges have severe limitations which curtail their use outside of the research arena. The technology will overcome these limitations by implementing algorithms that are robust, automated, scalable, deliver accurate data, and are usable in operational settings. They will provide spatially consistent and temporally relevant imagery which will empower businesses with regional and global outreach to make better decisions with better data.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of a drug screening system that will accelerate drug discovery for several eye diseases, including glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and macular edema.  This technology will fulfill unmet needs of small and large biopharmaceutical companies engaged in drug discovery for various eye diseases by reducing development cost, expediting preclinical research, and increasing the chances of clinical success.  From the socio-economic standpoint, this technology will result in the development of more effective ocular drugs that will decrease eye disease treatment cost. Furthermore, this model will facilitate more rapid development of technologies for the diagnosis of glaucoma and new surgical techniques in the management of this disease.  Overall, this screening system will accelerate the development of medications for eye diseases, enhancing the quality of life for millions of people.

    This SBIR Phase II project will address the lack of effective models for testing targeted glaucoma therapeutics and additional ocular diseases.  Currently, none of the available glaucoma medications target the eye tissue responsible for this disease due to absence of clinically relevant testing platform that incorporates this particular eye tissue. Presently, animal or human cadaver eyes are used to study and test the effects of medications on such tissue, however, these preparations are cumbersome and expensive. The proposed work will be the first-of-its-kind to engineer physiologically-relevant 3D human eye tissues utilizing novel cell culture methods along with microfabrication techniques and a microfluidic system. These 3D tissues will facilitate the development of disease-relevant in vitro model systems for understanding not only glaucoma but also diabetic retinopathy and macular edema pathology. This tool will help increase the success rate of glaucoma and ocular vasculature-related medications at later stages of drug development pipeline.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the production of enhanced-nutrition soybeans that have high levels of protein for use in aquafeed. Meat and fish consumption is rapidly growing due to increased world population and affluence. Aquaculture is the fastest growing food sector. Small wild-caught fish are used for aquaculture feed. Wild-caught fish harvests have not changed in 25 years and overfishing small fish jeopardizes the marine ecosystem. Aquafeed producers are turning to soy-based protein to replace fishmeal but soy-based proteins lack taurine and are deficient in methionine, two important nutrients for fish. To meet fish nutritional requirements, producers supplement soy-based aquafeed with synthetic taurine and methionine. In addition to added costs, synthetic taurine and methionine are produced from hazardous substances, and synthetic taurine has been shown to contain arsenic. Successful development of enhanced-nutrition soybean seeds would reduce the amount of supplemental nutrients required in aquafeed, a $2.2B global annual cost predicted for 2020, and could save aquafeed producers 20% of their additive feed costs. Enhanced-nutrition soybean seeds would be an economical, healthy, sustainable, environmentally friendly and secure source of taurine and methionine for the rapidly growing aquaculture industry.

    This SBIR Phase II project will use a biotechnology approach to increase the essential nutrients in soybean seeds for use in aquafeed. Many aquafeed producers use plant-based protein, primarily from soybean, as a replacement for fishmeal. However, plants lack some nutrients required for normal fish growth and development. Taurine and methionine, two nutrients either lacking or limited in soybean, are supplemented to soy-based aquafeed, thus increasing feed-production costs. The goal of this project is to increase the levels of taurine and methionine produced in the seeds of a commercial-grade, high-protein soybean variety that has high feed digestibility. Molecular and biochemical methods will be used to identify soybean seeds with: (1) taurine and high methionine levels; (2) uncompromised quality and viability; (3) unaffected levels of other nutrients; (4) normal to higher-than-normal protein content; and (5) low levels of nondigestible compounds. The anticipated results are the production of soybean seeds with a minimum of 0.2% taurine (dry seed weight) and at least 50% more total methionine compared with control seeds.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is to develop a new technology that combines advanced bioengineering with traditional chemical manufacturing. This hybrid approach will allow production of high value chemicals for the polymer industry using biomass at a lower price than current petrochemical based processes. This unique approach allows for the retrofit of existing ethanol fermentation facilities in rural areas with a bolt-on chemical upgrading unit to produce chemicals with far higher value than ethanol, improving the economics of operating these facilities and creating new jobs. The initial chemical product targeted by this project has an estimated $100M annual market and is used in manufacturing a variety of consumer products including specialty polyurethanes, inks, and UV degradable plastics which can be dramatically expanded to $1B by 2020 through cost reductions enabled by this new technology. Eventually, this approach combining existing fermentation facilities with a bolt-on chemical processing unit can be used to produce carbon-neutral fuels that are fully compatible with gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel at price comparable to current petrochemical fuels. This project, while here focused on the higher value polymer market, will enable later development of cost competitive fuel production technology.

    The objectives of this Phase II research project are to demonstrate at pilot scale a complete downstream process capable of manufacturing the target chemical from the intermediate platform molecule produced with fermentation. In upstream Visolis work, the key intermediate has been produced using fermentation facilities hosted at the Advanced Biofuels Process Demonstration Unit at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratories and the National Renewable Research Laboratories (NREL) at pilot scale, and based on current performance metrics the intermediate can be manufactured at prices comparable to ethanol at commercial scale. The goals of this downstream project are to utilize the intermediate generated using a 9000L scale fermentation facility at NREL to demonstrate cost-effective production of the target product from this intermediate. The work includes construction of a pilot scale high pressure chemical reactor, production and testing of several catalysts for performance in producing the target molecule at different process conditions, optimization of the chemical production process, evaluation of the process and catalyst for long-term stability, purification of the products to the levels required by customers, and technoeconomic modeling to inform the design of a commercial facility.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in enabling more efficient Annual Wind Energy Production (AEP) while reducing the cost of energy (COE). This will make wind energy more attractive economically, improve the energy security of the U.S, create jobs, and indirectly help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. A 2% AEP increase is generally considered attractive. Two turbines (5kW and 50kW) tested during Phase I have shown an increase in AEP between 2% to 8% while reducing the COE by 1% to 6%. About 150,000 turbines worldwide can be potentially be retrofitted with this technology.

    This project will address challenges related to aerodynamic efficiency of wind turbines and the cost of wind energy. It is based on a deeper understanding of wind turbine aerodynamics from a more 3-dimensional point of view; most wind turbine designs are based on 2- dimensional theories. The key technical challenge in bringing this technology to market is to demonstrate the increase in AEP of utility scale turbines retrofitted with our deflector technology in realistic field conditions while reducing the COE. This will be addressed by performing testing at a few customer wind farms and NREL testing centers. The R&D plan consists of designing, manufacturing, and installing deflectors on a few utility size turbines (30-100 meters diameter rotors). The tests will include power performance comparison between baseline and retrofitted turbines according to international standards.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of an informatics-based software platform that will help pharmaceutical companies create more new, effective, and safe drugs earlier in the R&D pipeline. This software platform will address a need for data integration and analysis tools to aid pharmaceutical researchers in 1) phenotypic screening, 2) toxicology analysis, and 3) drug repurposing. It will help these researchers quickly gather and interpret complex molecular and phenotypic data, making the drug discovery process more efficient and creating value for pharmaceutical companies. The economic impact of reducing the preclinical drug discovery process by just two weeks is estimated to be a $252 million cost savings for the industry. By using data more effectively earlier in the R&D process, this software platform also promises to enhance the quality of drugs that enter clinical trials. Thus, it provides an opportunity to reduce overall R&D spending and increase the number of drugs that enter the market - resulting in more economically priced medicines available to the population.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to build an informatics-based software platform that solves cross-domain data integration, analysis, and user application challenges in order to effectively use data to draw insights earlier in the R&D process and compress the development pipeline for new or repurposed drugs. Using highly scalable semantic graph technologies, a flexible three-layer architecture is being developed that includes the 1) Biomedical Data Layer, 2) Computational Layer, and 3) Application Layer. This architecture allows the system be fully scalable and extensible to other datasets and biomedical applications. The system will be beta-tested by pharmaceutical researchers and evaluated though the creation of scientifically relevant use-cases. This development will result in a commercial software system that makes important biomedical data and insights available to all researchers within a pharmaceutical organization by addressing high need data integration, analysis, and application challenges.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to significantly improve outcomes for cardiothoracic surgical patients while reducing healthcare costs by ensuring proper post-surgical drainage. In the United States, approximately 750,000 major cardiothoracic surgeries are performed each year. Each of these patients receives an average of two chest tubes to drain fluid and facilitate proper recovery, but approximately 36% of chest tubes become clogged. Patients with clogged chest tubes are more likely to experience post-surgical complications, which can result in life-threatening conditions and significantly increase the cost of care. To mitigate the risk of clogging, surgeons typically use large-bore chest tubes, which are more likely to be misplaced and to cause injury to surrounding organs. The novel device under development addresses these issues by preventing clog formation in small-bore chest tubes, thus maintaining proper fluid drainage. Anticipated impacts of the device include reduced time to ambulation and discharge, hospital readmissions, and nursing time. Commercially, the device addresses a $300 million initial market opportunity and has the potential to save the U.S. healthcare system approximately $1.7 billion per year from costs associated with preventable chest tube complications.

    The proposed project aims to develop a novel chest tube device to address the clinical need of maintaining proper fluid drainage after cardiothoracic surgery while enabling the use of small-bore chest tubes. Existing systems are prone to clogging, which can lead to life-threatening conditions, longer hospital stays, and increased costs. Building on the feasibility demonstrated in Phase I, the objective of this research is to continue development of the device and prepare for market entry; the research will be performed in three Aims. In the first Aim, critical aspects of usability and manufacturability will be addressed and incorporated into the final device design. In the second Aim, verification and validation activities will be performed to ensure the device meets all safety and functional requirements before clinical use. In the third Aim, the device?s supplemental ability to monitor lung healing status in patients undergoing thoracic surgery will be refined and tested on the benchtop and in an in vivo animal study.

    Innovation Research Phase II project is to offer a low-cost novel filter to purify
    water with higher effectiveness and superior performance than currently available
    technologies such as carbon filters. The global water scarcity, including some
    parts of the US such as the southwest, has led to a strong need for efficient
    technologies to purify wastewater for direct or indirect potable reuse. Recently,
    there has been growing concerns over emerging contaminants such as perfluorinated
    compounds (PFCs e.g. PFOA and PFOS) in surface and groundwater. These PFCs are
    being found at many groundwater sites and in drinking water wells affected by
    PFCs. Current technologies are not efficient for the removal of PFCs from water,
    and there is an immediate need for new cost-effective treatment technologies.
    To address this unfulfilled need, this project seeks to develop a low cost, reusable
    filter unit for water purification to remove emerging contaminants such as PFCs.
    The technology is expected to be used by entities conducting industrial wastewater
    and groundwater treatment, and wastewater utilities that have a focus on water
    reuse. \n\nThe objectives of this Phase II research project are to develop a prototype
    water filter,  test and optimize it for the removal of emerging contaminants with
    a focus on PFCs. Specifically, the project will focus on: (1) optimization of
    the adsorbent performance and synthesis method; and scale-up of the synthesis
    method for bulk production of filter media; (2) optimization of the filter regeneration
    process; and (3) design, construct, and test a prototype unit of the technology;
    and determine the process cost. The work will confirm the effectiveness of the
    filter in removing the target contaminants as well as the effectiveness of the
    regeneration process to reuse the filter. The PFC contaminants will be first removed
    from the water and then destroyed. The overall performance of the technology will
    also be evaluated and compared with other available technologies to determine
    its cost-effectiveness."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to fundamentally change what a storage device can do, and give storage a third capability that is not addressed by existing storage technology - the ability to actually process user data.  For the computation to take place, only the computational request and the resulting data need to transfer over the storage interface, reducing interface traffic and the required power. The advent of Big Data and the increasing use of Hyperscale Server technology have resulted in the creation of an additional storage tier that is different from traditional enterprise storage. This new tier requires significantly larger capacity yet lower cost, lower operating power, and yet must still exhibit enterprise level reliability. This combination of characteristics cannot be serviced by existing technologies, and execution with large data sets typical of Big Data results in inefficient solutions. The information being stored represents the large, unstructured data mined by today's companies for key information and trends that help dictate corporate direction, advertising, and monetization. Future applications include machine learning for video analytics, genome sequencing and enabling Fog Storage and Fog Computing, among others.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project explores the Big Data paradigm shift where processing capability is pushed as close to the data as possible. The In-Situ processing technology pushes this concept to the absolute limit, by putting the computational capability directly into the storage itself and eliminating the need to move data to main memory before processing. The technology innovation begins with a solid foundation of an enterprise SSD tailored for the needs of modern Data Centers. Key technology that will be added to support these capabilities include hardware-assisted quality of service control, low-cost 3D-TLC and QLC NAND Flash enablement through the use of advanced ECC, and a proprietary elastic Flash Translation Layer to support extremely large capacity drives. The final element added to this foundation will be the ability to perform computation directly on the data with the addition of specialized In-Situ processing aided by hardware accelerators.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is that the proposed runtime verification technology will lead to a more robust definition of and architecture for ensuring safety in automobiles, medical devices, and aerospace and defense systems.  Through this, these forms of safety-critical infrastructure will be more resilient to attack and catastrophic failure resulting from both critical system failures and malicious attacks.  As a result, the technology will help to address a slew of recent problems with software failures, security compromises, and other unintentional software behaviors that inevitably occur as systems become more complex, potentially saving lives and making millions of safety-critical embedded systems safer, easier to upgrade, and better tested.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will commercialize a first-of-its-kind complete solution for runtime verification and software analysis specifically tailored for embedded systems.  From automobiles that connect to each other and drive autonomously, to control systems that run ever increasing networks that power our utilities, cities, and many other aspects of our daily lives, it is clear that embedded systems are here to stay in the most safety critical domains.  A growing problem in embedded systems is how to ensure they behave correctly; a good case study for this is automobiles, in which several high profile hacks and recalls have called into question the security and integrity of vehicles.  The proposed solution will fill this market niche with a suite of related analysis tools/modules, built on a common novel and formally rigorous runtime verification technology infrastructure, each module implementing unique instrumentation and analysis functionality.  These tools/modules together provide what is needed to develop safe embedded systems.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will result from it having far-reaching societal, commercial, and technological impact. (1) Initial research by the Principal Investigator on analyzing the energy drain of AngryBirds has demonstrated the severe energy inefficiency of popular mobile apps in today's app market. The importance of this work is heightened by smartphones being an important enabler of Internet access for disadvantaged people in both developed and developing countries, and hence being an important tool in overcoming the "digital divide". (2) Commercially, the project will foster a paradigm shift in the mobile app industry ($101B industry in 2020) from the current feature-centric to energy-aware app design. Such a paradigm shift will have a significant, long lasting impact on the app industry. Energy-efficient apps lead to longer battery life, which in turn leads to longer user engagement time, which ultimately translates into millions of dollars of increased mobile revenue as all major businesses are shifting towards mobile. Hence this SBIR project will lead to a marketable product. (3) Technically, the proposed work will extend the performance profiling technology that is foundational to the software industry into the energy dimension, which is critical to the mobile software industry.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop the industry's first app energy management (AEM) solution to help app developers reduce app battery drain, and extend the battery life of billions of smartphones. The research objectives are (1) to develop advanced energy debugging techniques that can automatically identify energy drain opportunities from legitimate energy hotspots; and (2) to develop an SDK-based app energy monitoring system for monitoring app energy drain when running on consumer phones in the open market. These objectives pose significant technical challenges. While similar challenges on performance metrics (such as running time) have been well studied for traditional software, in particular in high-performance computing, in this project the company is expanding them to the energy dimension for the mobile app industry, which has not been attempted before. The company will develop novel machine-learning based solutions to learn, classify, and auto-detect energy optimization opportunities. As a result it expects to develop the first set of solutions to these fundamental challenges in optimizing the energy drain of millions of mobile apps in the app market.

    support the technological refinement and concomitant commercialization of the
    first accurate and portable instrument that can perform in the field nondestructive
    test for hardness, strength and ductility of existing infrastructure. The material
    properties measured include yield strength, work hardening exponent and ultimate
    tensile strength of metals, specifically steel. The on-shore oil and gas pipeline
    transmission industry has pressing needs for non-destructive tests because of
    the aging infrastructure, national need for energy, and recent explosions and
    leaks that have cost lives and billions in remediation. Although transmission
    pipelines have low failure rate per mile of assets, pipeline operators are asked
    to proactively enhance pipeline integrity where they do not have all the necessary
    strength data.  Therefore, there is an immediate need to verify strength during
    the 80,000 excavations done each year so that the life of these costly assets
    can be extended by identifying and remediating the few sections that are vulnerable
    within the extended network of 300,000 miles of pipelines. Pipe cut-outs and hydrostatic
    pressure tests are alternatives to nondestructive testing, but both damage the
    asset and require expensive and complex service interruption. \n\nThe overall
    technical objective of the Phase II work is to perform the necessary research
    and development to enable the development of engineering specifications, system
    integration, and validation of the instrument to successfully perform valuable
    nondestructive testing to provide precise and accurate material property data.
    The research and development program includes three milestones, each enabling
    the implementation of the research into design and manufacturing of beta test
    units.  Milestone 1 is to enable full instrument functionality under adverse field
    environments such as vibration, moisture, and extreme temperatures. Milestone
    2 is to perform the necessary work for designing ruggedized field units. Completion
    of this milestone will enhance the capability for initial field testing services.
    \ Milestone 3 is to develop the knowledge to fully and reliably integrate the
    system, validate the sub-systems, and package it for manufacturing. The overall
    goal is to enable the company to have the necessary knowledge and experience to
    enter the instrument market with a leasing program for use in pipeline inspections."

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is aimed at improving healthcare patient outcomes,
    potentially saving lives, and decreasing healthcare costs. The Drug Quality and
    Security Act of 2013 set stricter manufacturing standards on sterile injectable
    compounded medications that have closed many third party suppliers, thus creating
    shortages and higher prices.  In response, the American Society of Hospital Pharmacists
    expects 40% of the US market, 2000 hospitals, by 2018 to receive insourced compounds.
    \ Hospitals that insource hope to decrease their costs and improve patient safety
    with higher quality product.  Today, insourcing hospitals often have multiple
    information systems and use paper records cobbling together how a compound is
    made and to whom it has been administered.  When an ingredient recall occurs,
    hospitals spend hundreds of man-hours identifying the problem source and affected
    patients. To prevent further patient risks speed is demanded. This SBIR Phase
    I project will provide hospitals the capability of an end-to-end quality management
    that will track every production process step and tracing medications to patients.
    \ Hospitals will be able to prevent patients from receiving recalled medications
    and identify quality production compromises thus improving patient outcomes and
    potentially saving lives.  \n\n\nThe proposed project is a novel medication barcoded
    label encryption technology compatible with existing hospital scanners to provide
    track and trace capabilities of intravenous medication compounds.   Key objectives
    include both patient specific and anticipatory workflows with labels, a Passive
    Auditing management system for compounding quality control, and an innovation
    to improve operating room environment medication barcode scanning compliance.
    \ Today, healthcare providers utilize multiple barcoded label technologies with
    minimal embedded medication data across disparate systems.  Medication labels
    could be the link across these systems for ingredient traceability.  However,
    existing solutions are inadequate to meet 2013 legislative traceability mandates.
    \ The project invention will encrypt serialization fields within the barcoded
    label connecting a specific medication to its production data, and eventually
    to the patient.  Compounding process data, such as ingredients, environmental
    conditions, and production instructions, will be connected to individual medication
    labels and stored in the patient?s electronic record.  When an ingredient is recalled
    or questionable process identified, an extraction algorithm will pull the encrypted
    data from the EHR and will be connected to production data. Success of this project
    will be label readability by existing hospital scanners and retrieval of the serialized
    data from the EHR"

    in the United States with a lower limb amputation to walk in unconstrained environments.
    \ The proposed Quasi-Active Prosthetic Ankle System (QPAS) addresses the RH6:
    Human Assistive Technologies area.  QPAS will be lightweight, have a long battery
    life, and optimize the passive dynamics of amputee gait in unconstrained environments
    by using battery energy to tune its physical system properties, ankle equilibrium
    angle and torsional stiffness.  The device provides a unique set of features that
    do not currently exist in the market, strengthening its value proposition.  The
    amputee population is growing; 2,000 new lower limb amputation are performed each
    week.  Therefore, QPAS will have strong market potential and the significant societal
    impact of improving health by supporting a more active lifestyle for lower limb
    amputees.  This will also lead to more community and family involvement.  Additionally,
    because of the many possibilities to control QPAS, gait researchers will be able
    to study amputee compensation preferences.  A better understanding of the kinematic
    and kinetic preferences could lead to improvements in the design of purely passive
    ankle prostheses.  \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2

    from reduced self-selected walking speed, increased metabolic cost, increased
    reaction loads on the sound limb, poor gait symmetry, and reduced stability with
    increased risk of falling.  Passive prosthetic feet are only tuned for level ground
    walking at one speed.  QPAS will utilize a patented compliant actuator to achieve
    a unique set of features: passive energy storage with an articulating ankle joint,
    adaptable ankle angle for slope gait, low electrical energy usage, a large range
    of ankle motion, adaptable stiffness to optimize variable cadence level ground
    and slope gait, and controlled energy delivery to ensure energy builds naturally
    and smoothly.  In this phase 2 SBIR, an intuitive and autonomous controller will
    be built for the QPAS and human subject evaluations will assist in refining the
    device towards commercialization. QPAS will become a successful product by focusing
    on improved amputee gait performance in unconstrained environments, and being
    simple to fit and adjust, reliable and affordable."

    This SBIR Phase II project will develop an easy to use real-time formative assessment tool for educators that will be uniquely aligned to each student and deployed via a virtual reality learning game that uses venomous marine snails as a conduit for exploring scientific issues in nature. The USA is currently ranked 52nd in the world in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. This is detrimental intellectually and economically to the future of American society. Recent studies indicate it is not what is taught, but how it is taught that enhances student-learning abilities, particularly as it pertains to STEM. As a result, this project is driven by the research objectives to understand how children learn specific science content and why certain game elements are better suited to convey scientific material. The outcome of this project is a proprietary multi-tiered formative assessment tool that can measure real time student learning of novel STEM content obtained through a virtual reality learning game experience. This project will enable teachers to nimbly tailor future instruction with individualized student learning goals.  Commercialization of the products created in this project will transform scientific learning and measurable engagement in educational games for social and economic benefit to meet the NSF?s mission of supporting education initiatives that improve the lives of U.S. Citizens, and generate income for tax revenue and jobs via the employment of software designers, educators and scientists.

    The proprietary technology developed in this SBIR Phase II will be a first-of-its-kind assessment dashboard that will link virtual reality and web-based learning environments with formative assessment to fuel instruction and deepen learning. This project will build proprietary assessment tools into online and virtual reality games which continuously engage users in the process of scientific inquiry and discovery using novel formative assessments customized to each player. The proprietary assessment dashboard allows teachers and players to measure their progress in real-time and identify opportunities to enhance their STEM learning. Using Unity as the platform, player actions and decisions will be met with tailored formative assessments and ongoing feedback throughout game play. This feedback helps teachers delineate where their students are along their learning progressions and fuels further instruction. The novel approach of this assessment dashboard transforms qualitative and quantitative learning and has the potential to significantly enhance student engagement and commitment to scientific inquiry to support emerging science changemakers. The research objective of the player/teacher dashboard is to align feedback on student learning during game play with dynamic quantitative and qualitative formative assessment that create a seamless demonstration of knowledge acquisition while providing teachers with multiple opportunities to engage learners in deeper and more meaningful levels of inquiry before, during, and after gameplay. The products generated from this project are aligned to the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and the International Baccalaureate (IB) program to ensure the content is of the highest caliber and distribution is to a large global customer base. The anticipated results from exposing teachers and students to this project will be increased competencies in STEM, which will transform players into lifelong learners and enhance engagement in STEM fields and careers.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop new alloys whose thermal expansion properties can be tailored for laser applications. The tailored thermal expansion alloys will prevent shifts in laser output frequencies, i.e. laser color, by preventing the natural temperature-induced thermal expansion and contraction that occurs in laser housings. This temperature stability is extremely important for fiber-optic systems that are the backbone of the telecommunications industry. According to Strategies Unlimited, the telecommunications laser market was $3.515 billion in 2014, and it is expected to increase with the increasing number of mobile devices and growing demand for high-speed internet. While oil and gas telecommunications systems were identified as the beachhead market, the alloys developed through this project will also have potential to add value to the wider telecommunications market and a number of other industrial and electronics applications.

    The intellectual merit of this project lies in a new method to exhibit unprecedented control over thermal expansion properties in metal alloys. The discovery that mechanical deformation tailors or "programs" the thermal expansion of a bulk metal to match that of other common materials (metals, polymers, and ceramics) will change the way scientists and engineers design for thermal compensation. These alloys can also be tailored not to expand or contract with temperature changes and even be made to shrink when heated. This wide range of tailored alloy responses is achieved without chemical changes or composite fabrication methods upon which competing technologies rely. This Phase II project will reduce the risks associated with implementing the tailored thermal expansion alloy technology in laser applications by developing high thermal conductivity alloys and testing prototypes. Alloys will be purchased, engineered to have a desired coefficient of thermal expansion, and tested for laser performance. The expected outcome of this work is the realization of tailored thermal expansion alloys in laser prototypes.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will demonstrate the use of a new carbon-based water treatment process to condition and soften hard water sources. Specifically, this treatment process uses functionalized porous carbon sheets and small applied electrical voltages (<1.2 V) to target (adsorb and desorb) salt molecules from hard water streams. In addition, this process is reversible, resulting in a carbon-based filter that can soften water streams without significant maintenance or upkeep and providing a water softening solution that does not add to the "throw-away" culture that is common to many water treatment devices. Importantly, no salt or chemical additives are needed for this softening technique, further limiting its environmental impact in comparison to conventional salt-based softeners, and the energy required for this separation may best the most efficient techniques in use today.

    The proposed process is called inverted capacitive deionization (i-CDI). In i-CDI, salt molecules are naturally attracted to the carbon electrode surfaces due to the creation of electrodes possessing significant surface charge in aqueous environments. Electrodes are then regenerated using a small voltage, matched to the surface chemistry of the functionalized carbon electrodes, and salt is concentrated into a discharge stream. Through this Phase II project, the i-CDI process will be demonstrated for water softening applications in both food & beverage and industrial environments. Currently, water softening in these industries is carried out through chemical treatments, ion exchange, or selective membranes. In this project, surface charged carbon electrodes will be used in "flow-through" cell modules to demonstrate preferential removal of calcium, magnesium, carbonate, and other hardness-causing ions to soften multiple hard water sources. Comparisons will be drawn between this new i-CDI technology and incumbent water treatment techniques to outline benefits towards equipment downtime, energy costs, and effectiveness of the separation. Liquid sampling and lifetime studies will be conducted to further prove the benefits of this membrane-free, salt-free system.

    Research Phase II project provides a technology platform to convert non-food biomass,
    such as wood and corn stalks, into biofuels, chemicals, and bioproducts. Biomass
    utilization is a solution to increase global sustainability and decrease petroleum-based
    greenhouse gas emissions. This project will use wood biomass to simultaneously
    co-produce three high-end products, dissolving pulp, furfural, and technical lignin,
    of which the dissolving pulp and furfural are the focus of this project. Current
    methods of producing these products only use one of the three primary biomass
    components. By co-producing two products, revenues increase and unit production
    costs decrease as production costs are spread over a larger product volume. The
    use of this solvent obtained from the biomass is a unique approach in the biomass
    conversion industry and offers an alternative to conventional enzyme or microbial
    processing. Benefits include restoring furfural production in the United States,
    decreasing dissolving pulp production costs, and increasing the commercial value
    of renewable biomass that currently has low or no value. This sustainable and
    environmentally friendly technology will increase global sustainability and revitalize
    rural economies by stimulating investment and creating jobs. \n\nThe objectives
    of this Phase II research project are to demonstrate and advance to pilot scale
    our technology to simultaneously co-produce dissolving pulp and furfural from
    biomass using gamma valerolactone (GVL) as solvent. While other technologies focus
    on the production of a single product from biomass, GVL?' ability to fractionate
    lignocellulosic biomass into its three main components (cellulose, hemicellulose,
    and lignin) at high concentration and purity, produce significant cost and technical
    advantages. GVL fractionation produces solid cellulose at high yield (>90%) and
    purity (>90%), without the need for pre-treatment or further chemical refining.
    This cellulose can be converted into dissolving pulp for high-end applications
    such as textiles (rayon), cellophane, or microcrystalline cellulose. The hemicellulose
    fraction does not need to be separated from the GVL and is readily converted into
    furfural within GVL at high yields (>75%) and high concentrations, minimizing
    separation costs. Preliminary mass and energy balances and techno-economic modeling
    based on lab data predict attractive financial returns. Tasks will focus on biomass
    fractionation to produce dissolving pulp, furfural purification, and GVL recovery
    at bench-scale. This experimental work will inform the engineering development
    for an integrated, continuous process, pilot demonstration unit."

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project will address ALL of the factors attributing to
    protein aggregation by determining the: size, identity, extent, mechanism of aggregation
    and stability, thus addressing Biopharma industry needs. This information is critical
    to the development of drug pipeline contributing to a $190 BN biologic's market
    where $87BN in first generation biologics face patent expiration before 2020.
    A successful technical approach for its implementation will provide essential
    information for decision making towards which candidates will enter the market,
    thus increasing the Biopharma valuation and ensuring supply of drugs to patients.
    In the end, improving the quality of life of patients with chronic diseases.\n\nThe
    proposed project will address the need for a multivariate high-throughput technology
    to address the risk of protein aggregation, that when adopted in R&D, will increase
    pipeline approvals, reduce late stage withdrawals and total costs of drug development.
    Average R&D development costs for the mere 1% of candidates reaching FDA approval
    have risen to $2.6 BN per product. Protein therapeutic development needs to be
    guided by a full understanding of protein stability and aggregation. \nResearch
    objectives are to: develop our innovative First-in-Class high throughput platform
    for screening protein therapeutics; develop original software capable of deciphering
    protein aggregation mechanism, size, identity and extent of aggregated protein
    and product stability; commercialize the innovative technology platform. Fully
    automated evaluation of protein candidates during early R&D phase will be conducted.
    Best-in-class image acquisition technology will be employed towards this end,
    using a label free chemical mapping technology, dedicated software using auto
    recognition algorithms, and correlations to decipher protein aggregation. We through
    the use of its breakthrough technology will determine: the aggregate free candidate
    under various stressor conditions, optimum formulation conditions for the protein
    therapeutic, the most stable candidate, and electronic data reporting that establishes
    accuracy, reproducibility, critical quality attributes of the protein product."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to promote and improve the use of high quality video in products that the general public works with every day.  From high resolution auto dashboard cameras, to low latency video streams from flying drones, to wireless laptop docking stations, to higher quality coverage of news and sporting events, to better and faster delivery of video over the Internet, every application requires the high quality, low latency, flexible, power efficient video encoders that will be developed in this project.  The uses of video are increasing every day.  Video instruction manuals are replacing printed instruction manuals.  Video is replacing still images in on-line advertising, social media and billboards.  It is predicted that over 90% of all Internet traffic will be video data in the next few years.  Enabling all these applications requires the latest technology in video compression such as the techniques developed in this project.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project tackles the problem of creating a real time video encoder, using the latest H.265 compression technology, running in hardware on an FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array).  An FPGA is a type of chip on which the logic is configurable - it can be programmed to implement any function.  It represents a mid-point between a dedicated integrated circuit, which is very expensive to develop, and can never be changed or enhanced once it is fabricated, and a pure software solution which is very flexible but requires bulky and power hungry equipment (i.e. computers) as an underlying platform.  The research conducted under this grant will devise, test, and implement algorithms that are amenable to realization on an FPGA, that operate in real time, and that yield a high quality result in terms of the visual quality of the compressed video with respect to the number of bits used.  The goal, at the conclusion of this research, is the demonstration of a functional HEVC/H.265 encoder running on an FPGA which has cost, flexibility, power and performance advantages over other encoders.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to transform commercial construction through the democratization of scanning and automation of Building Information Modeling (BIM). Constant design and change management is a unique challenge that is costing the US construction industry billions of dollars annually. In order to prevent such a huge economic loss, this industry is in the path for a digital revolution. BIM is known as the first truly global digital technology that could revolutionize the construction industry. However, BIM usage is currently limited because it is only viable for large-scale projects. The primary reason is that the process is too laborious and expensive. The proposed technology will completely eliminate these barriers. Its ease-of-use, ubiquity of the capturing device, and automated object detection democratizes as-built BIM modeling. Enormous value could be generated due to streamlining and data management capabilities that are offered by the technology in the form of accelerated project schedules, reduced numbers of requests for information and change orders, and timely identified design clashes. This will pave the way to increase the competitiveness of the US construction industry, by enabling new products and services that support automatic BIM modeling.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project investigates the technical and commercial feasibility of an automatic and inexpensive solution for the Scan-to-BIM problem in the construction industry. Scan-to-BIM refers to 3D scanning of a physical structure and converting the captured raw spatial data into an object-oriented, semantically-rich model. Although there are a few technologies that aim to facilitate this process, the 3D modeling component remains primarily a manual and time-consuming task. When using the proposed technology, a non-technical worker videotapes the target structure. The video is automatically sent to a server for processing. A unique videogrammetric 3D reconstruction engine reconstructs the 3D geometry of the structure in the form of a 3D point cloud. It then extracts object hypotheses from key video frames and spatial data in the form of observations. Afterwards, it optimizes a novel coherent joint probability distribution function and infers a 3D layout. The outcome is an object-oriented 3D representation of the structure with embedded geometrical attributes and property sets. The main novelty of this technology lies in a hybrid approach that combines low-level segmentation with high-level space modeling. This advances the state-of-the-art in robust intelligence, particularly the interpretation of complex, unstructured data.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop and commercialize a high resolution,
    protein-based retinal implant intended to restore vision to the millions of patients
    blinded by retinal degenerative diseases, particularly retinitis pigmentosa and
    age-related macular degeneration. These currently incurable and blinding diseases
    affect between 30-50 million people worldwide, and lead to a loss of independence
    for the individual, as well as an increased burden on their caregivers. While
    improved quality of life is the most vital outcome of this technology, reduction

    doctors will also be of benefit to the broad healthcare field.  The work outlined
    in this SBIR proposal also has the potential to significantly impact our understanding
    of retinal degenerative diseases, which will help in developing better and more
    effective treatments for a number of ophthalmic indications. The subretinal implant
    under development provides the framework for the next generation of high-resolution
    retinal prosthetics, while offering a cost-effective solution to vision restoration,
    and will help these patients regain independence and thus improve their quality
    of life. \n\nThe proposed project will expand on the data collected from the in
    vivo surgical development and ex vivo efficacy studies supported by our Phase
    I/IB awards.  First, a 40-animal rat study will be undertaken to further investigate
    the biocompatibility of the retinal implant.  Second, previously developed surgical
    procedures will be refined in pigs to ensure reproducible and safe subretinal
    implantation. Third, a high-throughput in vitro assay will be designed to investigate
    a number of implant parameters, as well as the integrity and biostability of the
    retinal implant using retinal pigment epithelial cells.   Additionally, medical
    device sealants will be investigated in this in vitro study, and the functional
    integrity of the implant will be measured using time-resolved absorption spectroscopy
    and an ion-sensitive detector, which is being developed specifically for this
    application.  Lastly, this ion-sensitive detector will provide an opportunity
    to further measure the spatial sensitivity of the retinal implant with high resolution.
    \ These in vivo and in vitro studies are vital for the continued evaluation of
    biocompatibility, surgical feasibility, and efficacy of the implant.  The results
    from these studies will further demonstrate the commercial viability of the technology

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to develop an online, fully automated platform for designing high-affinity antibodies for use as potential drug candidates. The success of antibody-based drugs has generated interest in faster and more efficient methods to discover and optimize antibodies. The goal of this project will be to develop and implement a computational method for producing protein sequences of humanized antibodies. This will be achieved by providing software that allows scientists to move some of their initial experiments into the cloud, and achieve results much more quickly by using computational methods saving time and cost for new drug development. In addition, it is anticipated that this will improve the features of antibody-based drug candidates, enhance the success rate of clinical studies, and accelerate the commercialization of new drugs.

    This SBIR Phase II project aims to develop and implement computational tools for designing antibodies that are more effective, have fewer side effects, and have fewer problems in manufacturing. Current computational design methods rely almost entirely on the expertise of scientists iterating between experimental and bioinformatics approaches. An automated, systematic approach will help researchers design better antibodies with desired features in a shorter amount of time. The final platform will allow researchers to incorporate experimental and structural information to develop better drugs by determining which experiments will be necessary, assessing the viability of a potential candidate, and identifying structural features responsible for the molecule?s stability, immune response, and binding properties. The typical antibody design process takes many months and tens of thousands of dollars. With the aid of a computational process, this time can be cut back to the click of a button.

    grade students how to solve mathematical problems that seem difficult, maybe even
    hopeless at first. Problems, by definition, are hard to solve. They require intensive
    thinking and open-ended experimentation, which are often not possible in today's
    classrooms. In the software, an expert avatar takes students on math explorations
    in video-game-quality 3D where they visualize and discover eye-opening mathematical
    truths. The program helps teachers turn math into exciting explorations that students
    will love. For example, as students fly a jumbo jet from New York to Tokyo, they
    effortlessly discover methods for finding the shortest path between two points
    on the surface of a sphere, which is a difficult geometry problem. Teachers can
    easily fit the program into their daily instruction and get crucial details about
    the weak spots of each student. The joy of discovery is envisioned to increase
    students' interest in math, science, and engineering and to significantly reduce
    their math anxiety. Besides creating jobs and tax revenue, the project is expected
    to contribute to measurably improved math scores across the nation's 132,000 schools
    educating 58 million students. \n\nThe software being developed in this project
    is unique in that it emulates the natural style of communication between a student
    and an expert math teacher and immerses students in 3D virtual worlds where they
    develop deep mathematical insight and solve fascinating real-world problems. The
    program's ability to develop both mathematical content knowledge and problem-solving
    skills at the same time, as well as its capability to non-intrusively assess students
    during the mathematical explorations is also unmatched. During the Phase II project,
    the commercially viable software will be fully developed and its efficacy to improve
    students' mathematical problem-solving skills will be thoroughly researched. A
    pretest-posttest control group experiment will be conducted in authentic education
    settings to determine efficacy. The software's educational model and content may

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the development of genetically engineered tobacco plants that produce antibodies for the treatment of individuals infected with the Ebola virus. In the recent Ebola outbreak, a new antibody-based drug was shown to be effective in treating infected patients that was based on a transient tobacco-produced Ebola antibody cocktail called ZMapp (Mapp Biopharmaceutical, Inc, San Diego, CA). Unfortunately, Mapp Biopharmaceutical's supply of antibody was quickly depleted, as the manufacturing method was not able to keep up with demand. The technological innovation in this proposal is the targeted production of antibodies within the gland cells of the tobacco leaf surface structures called glandular secreting trichomes. The research objectives will be to demonstrate the secretion of antibodies to the Ebola virus from tobacco trichome glands. The goal is to generate a line of N. tabacum plants that is optimized for antibody production in plant trichomes to provide a biomanufacturing platform for the large-scale production of antibodies that may be used in the treatment of Ebola infection, and in the future, other diseases.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to use a recently developed plant-based biomanufacturing system to scale-up the production of antibodies to the Ebola virus for use as a therapeutic treatment. Mapp Biopharmaceutical has produced a drug based on antibodies to the Ebola virus produced in a tobacco plant transient gene expression system.  Using this system, they have identified a glycosylated antibody variant (glycoform) with enhanced antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity. Using glycosyl-transferase knockout lines of N. benthiamiana and transient expression strategies, the company utilizes plants to produce glycosylated antibodies that produce optimal recruitment of natural immune effector cells (Olinger et al., 2012). Other expression hosts (Chinese hamster ovary cells, yeast) yield product with reduced potency, and are not suitable alternatives. To recover active antibody with their current plant expression technology, Mapp Biopharmaceutical must destructively harvest plants, and isolate antibody from plant tissue homogenates. Unfortunately, this method has not been able to produce enough antibodies to satisfy the demand.  The proposed method will allow for the production of antibodies in tobacco plants in large scale.  In addition, the proposed system will use antibody harvesting strategies that do not require destructive homogenization as the antibodies will be secreted onto the surface of the leaf, and recovered by washing. The goals of this project are to increase the functionality of plant-produced antibodies, scale-up production, and reduce the costs of production further through system optimization.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to address one of the primary barriers to the emergence of flexible electronics -the inability to assembly and interconnect thinned integrated circuits (ICs) onto flexible substrates in a reliable, cost-effective, high volume manner. Flexible electronics has been the subject of many industry journals, trade shows, technical conferences and market research reports. All describe a new age of ubiquitous electronics with devices embedded in the structures and items around us.  Flexible electronic devices, unlike today's devices that are rigid and boxy, can conform to natural, curved shapes that exist in the real world. However, flexible electronics have yet to have their predicted economic and social impact. A major reason is because the electronics industry has not yet found a reliable, low-cost method for assembling thin, flexible ICs onto flexible circuit boards. Today's 'pick-and-place' assembly technology cannot handle ICs thin enough to be flexible. Until a new method is developed and adopted, the potential of flexible electronics will likely not be realized.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will advance the integrated circuit (IC) aspects of a flexible hybrid electronics technology to a level at which these devices can be produced reliably and in volumes in a production-relevant environment. While most of the components of flexible hybrid electronics technology relating to printed electronics methods have been adequately researched and developed, little has been done on the integration of solid-state semiconductor devices onto highly flexible, organic substrates. Partial results have been reported in the literature, however, no attempt has been made to provide a comprehensive, wafer-to-end product approach suitable for commercial applications. This project will address this gap by focusing on all the steps for IC integration, including the preparation for assembly of ultra-thin, flexible semiconductor dies, their attachment onto a flexible circuit board using laser-enabled assembly technology, and their reliable electrical interconnection. The anticipated end results will be a complete flexible hybrid electronics integration technology developed to a level of pilot production readiness.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is that it will enable a group of customers we call Risk Pricers (specifically, property and casualty insurance underwriters and mortgage bankers in financial firms) to profit from tailoring pricing on their products. They can do this by rapidly predicting financial losses for buildings having specific configurations, using the software developed in this proposal. These customers can then tailor pricing of earthquake insurance and mortgage terms based on refined analyses that we facilitate. Besides offering a clear financial benefit to Risk Pricers, this new analysis approach will also fundamentally change market forces and incentives around building safety. If a building's owner is incentivized to improve its earthquake performance (via lower insurance and mortgage costs), then high-performance buildings become more appealing and this will encourage design of better buildings. As the company's software makes more explicit the links between building properties and financial costs, society will benefit from more efficient resource allocation, ultimately leading to increased societal resilience.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop algorithms and software tools that provide financial guidance to customers interested in repair costs and closures of buildings due to earthquakes.  To complete the development of its tool, the company will focus on calibrating statistical models to predict displacements and accelerations in a wide range of building types, when they are subjected to earthquake shaking. The company's method for rapid estimation of structural responses utilizes principles of engineering mechanics, but applied in a domain where academic research does not focus (i.e., estimating response of a structure whose properties are not fully known to the analyst). The key identified need is to calibrate a statistical predictive model for the response of a structure that is effective over all popular construction types of interest to customers in the insurance and mortgage banking markets (i.e., light frame wood, steel, concrete, concrete tilt-up). The company will also develop loss metric and calculation outputs that incorporate insurance contract conditions such as deductibles and limits, in order to link the calculations to customers' workflows.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project can lead to a revolution in the consumer electronics market
    (mobile handsets, tablets, game consoles and wearables), wherein high performance, low power, small footprint
    multisensing (not limited to inertial sensing) platforms with timing devices, are all directly microfabricated on a common
    ASIC substrate. Sensor fusion can produce unprecedented user experiences by using data collected from all sensors and
    processed using machine learning algorithms. This can further boost the sensor and timing markets that are expected to
    exceed $6 billion dollars by 2017. Moreover, the emergent Internet of Things (IoTs) and wearable markets are expected to
    reach $20 billion dollars by 2025, which can induce a rapid growth of such intelligent sensor fusion market. This can have
    a tremendous societal impact as wearable devices and IoT systems, interfaced with mobile platforms, can be used to
    monitor people?s health, safety and energy consumption. Making these solutions affordable will make it amenable to low
    income households not only in the US but also around the world. It will also enable researchers to attain new frontiers of
    knowledge such as in digital sensory systems. The long-term goals are to provide such intelligent sensor fusion solutions.

    This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project seeks to demonstrate wafer-scale microfabrication of
    Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) inertial sensors directly on the application specific integrated circuit (ASIC)
    substrates, by using electroplated copper (e-Cu) as a structural material. MEMS inertial sensors, such as gyroscopes and
    accelerometers, are pervasively used in consumer electronics and automotive industries. Current trends are, however,
    requiring higher device performance with smaller footprints, wherein multi-degree-of-freedom sensors are integrated on
    the same package, to enable new capabilities and user experiences. These requirements can be met by monolithically
    fabricating inertial sensors on ASIC substrates, which is complex to achieve with silicon as a structural material. Using e-
    Cu, which is currently used for ASIC metal interconnects, as the structural material, can enable easier routing to
    implement optimized mechanical structures, smaller dimensions given the high density of copper, extremely low cost as
    no wafer bonding is required, smaller form factors, multiple sensors on a single die, and much smaller parasitics providing
    low noise and higher performance. Phase II tasks will be to wafer-scale fabricate an inertial measurement unit that is
    monolithically integrated with its ASIC with optimal performance parameters.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be high performance error correction for flash memory. Error correction plays a critical row in making digital devices reliable. Shrinking semiconductor geometries results in more errors. This has created a special problem for flash memory where the need for more rigorous error correction is approaching a practical limit with the widely used Bose Chaudhuri Hocquengham error correction. Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) is a recognized solution that  can approach the theoretical limits of what is possible. This LDPC based technology can improve lifetime of flash by without the added cost of the existing BCH solution. This technology helps Flash Memory enterprises to use higher density flash to improve storage capacity and cut the storage product costs. Without the superior performance, small size and low power consumption of the LDPC technology, the migration to low cost high capacity flash memories will be seriously slowed. In the absence of a comparable alternative approach, there will be serious limitations on the performance of a vast array of products that depend on highly reliable and economical flash storage.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will use a variety of  techniques to minimize the area and power requirements and enhance the performance of Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) error correction codes for flash memory. Many of these techniques are applicable to a wide range of error correction applications in digital communication and storage from WiFi to hard disk drives. The need for better error correction is crucial for flash memory but there is a widening demand for improved error correction. For example larger memories require better error correction to insure the system failure rate is low. In the next two years the company expects to develop a Verilog version of the LDPC decoder that is easily integrated with a flash controller. The project will work with potential customers/partners to ensure the code works with controllers. In the long run these techniques can be adapted to a wide range of applications as the need for more reliable data continues to rapidly expand.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project in the long term has two main components.  First, the development has potential to reduce the country's overall energy consumption by funding the development of low cost air quality sensors for energy efficient buildings.  And second, the project will enhance the safety of our natural gas infrastructure with a low cost, low power methane (natural gas) sensor technology.    This work will develop a methane (natural gas) sensor prototype with 10x lower cost, size and power consumption than current solutions.  The proposed methane sensor will meet several currently unmet needs.  These include enhanced public safety by enabling methane leak detection for natural gas distribution systems, and protecting first responders by enabling more and better methane detection in hazardous environments.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop the world's most porous materials, Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as a sensing material.  MOFs have been an active topic in material science research for over a decade, but they have yet to find a commercial application.  This project promises to be the first commercialization of this exciting new class of materials.  Nearly 40,000 different MOF structures have been identified to date.  The crux of this work is to use a combination of computer models and laboratory experimentation to optimize a MOF structure that selectively and rapidly absorbs methane gas.  The end goal of this project is to develop a commercial prototype methane sensor 'on a chip' that consists of a solid state mass transducer with the MOF coating that has been tuned for sensing methane.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project can be found across the semiconductor industry with its initial market in wireless communications.  Due to the extraordinary properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), applications include low noise amplifiers (LNAs), mixers, and RF power amplifiers (PAs). Looking forward, carbon nanotube transistors (CFETs) can reshape analog radio frequency electronics, enabling the higher data rates and improved capacity demanded by next generation wireless systems due to their intrinsic linearity and associated low out of band interference . CFETs are highly efficient, dissipating less unwanted power than current state of the art technologies while handling high power levels. This translates into more battery life for mobile devices with lower cooling costs. With more linear RF transistors, many billions of dollars of spending on additional base stations, larger batteries, and radio spectrum can be avoided, at great savings to consumers and industry. More speculatively, the creation of reliable grwoth techniques for CFETs and associated manufacturing processes may offer an excellent sensor platform or better ways to form on chip interconnects. The key problems being investigating of in situ growth of high performance nanotubes are applicable to the fabrication of CNT based devices for many electronic applications.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop electronic devices for radio frequency applications using carbon nanotubes (CNTs).  CNTs are a one dimensional material with diameters in the nanometer range. CNTs have unique and highly desirable properties ranging from superior mobility to current carrying capability to thermal stability.  Calculations show CNT amplifiers will be inherently linear with noise suppressed to the lowest possible quantum limit. These properties allow for electronic devices that will perform better than existing technologies, such as silicon and gallium arsenide.  Just as importantly, the cost for making these devices will be dramatically lower due to the relatively simple method for material synthesis and device fabrication. This work will enable wafer scale arrays of high density in-situ tubes to be grown on silicon enabling the development of carbon electronic components a manner comparable to silicon devices. This work will enable cost effective wafer scale growth of devices which exploit the groundbreaking linearity that CNTs can deliver.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of new tools to understand the dynamic behavior of cellular machinery that is disrupted in disease. Unraveling the dynamic aspects of cellular physiology that may be targeted therapeutically requires new technologies capable of profiling the response of entire signaling pathways to pharmacological intervention targeted at single pathway nodes. The availability of physiologically relevant live-cell models that are compatible with visualizing and quantifying the spatiotemporal regulation of disease-relevant signal transduction pathways and cellular machinery will be key to enabling this approach.  The ability to monitor multiple facets of key cancer signaling pathways in this way represents a valuable opportunity to identify potent and selective therapeutic inhibitors of "undruggable" targets, such as the Ras protein, which is a crucial driver of more than 30% of cancers. By enabling development of a robust and scalable high-throughput live-cell assay platform, this technology may reduce the time and cost to pinpoint the mechanism of action and off-target effects of pharmaceutical chemicals, thus delivering new capabilities to rapidly and cost-effectively identify safe and effective therapeutics.

    This SBIR Phase II project will develop a robust and flexible platform for rapid generation of precision-engineered, multicolor fluorescent cell lines and associated high-throughput microscopy-based assays. This platform contrasts with industry standard methods for developing such cell lines and assays, which are lengthy and inflexible.  The project comprises optimization and execution of four components:  1) Generation of a panel of cell lines compatible with rapid, reliable stable reporter integration; 2) Delivery of a library of approximately 25 multicolor reporters of the Ras/MAPK pathway; 3) Rapid generation and validation of a library of  approximately 100 validated stable reporter cell lines expressing all therapeutically relevant mutations and isoforms of the Ras/MAPK pathway;  and 4) 384-well plate assay development and screening of these Ras/MAPK reporter cells using tool compounds. The project aims to demonstrate the capability of the platform to rapidly pinpoint compound mechanism of action and potential off-target effects by monitoring multiple facets of previously inaccessible biology associated with a critical, high-value oncology target in live cells. The standardized platform established in the course of this project will allow rapid expansion to additional clinically relevant signaling pathways.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in significantly reducing global carbon emissions using vacuum insulating glass. Vacuum glass is like a flat and transparent thermos bottle for windows. Vacuum glass has three times less heat loss than triple pane glass but costs no more to manufacture.  This disruptive value proposition will drive rapid market penetration, regardless of energy price, and without the need for government subsidy.  This project will produce vacuum insulating glass that will enable R-10 windows, consistent with the goals and schedule of the DOE Windows Roadmap.  Immediate benefits include improved occupant comfort and reduced heating bills without thermostat setback. Furthermore, vacuum windows will be condensation-free and fog-free forever. The potential impact is huge. Buildings represent 40% of total U.S. carbon emissions. Near-universal use could reduce total U.S. energy use by 3% (about 3 quadrillion BTU/year), while adding no cost to building infrastructure. Germany, Japan, Australia, China, and Russia have vacuum glass development programs; a successful development under this project will ensure that the U.S. stays at the scientific and technological forefront of this technology, and participates in a large and growing market.




    This project will develop the use of plasma degassing to achieve a vacuum life beyond 20 years, a condition for private investment. Without adequate degassing, moisture attached to internal surfaces is trapped at the time of seal-off. Trapped moisture molecules will later outgas, causing vacuum decay. Traditional high-temperature bakeout is too costly for affordable vacuum glass. Bakeout takes hours, but plasma degassing takes minutes. A German vacuum glass development effort tried plasma degassing under vacuum, which is inefficient. In contrast, this project will use atmospheric pressure plasma degassing, which is both faster and cheaper. Building on lessons learned during the Phase I project, a plasma treatment protocol will be developed to produce VIG panes as large as 25% of the average residential window size.  Working in parallel, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory will work to optimize the insulating performance of the design to enable an R-10 window for the DOE Windows Roadmap. Thereafter, an integrated pilot line will be assembled, able to produce vacuum glass units suitable for meaningful retrofit projects. Finally, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory will conduct accelerated life testing. Independent life data, combined with a successful operating pilot line, will help secure private investment for commercialization.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to produce colostrum proteins in edible

    in livestock animals. Colostrum proteins have both beneficial health and growth
    properties that may drastically decrease the dependence on antibiotics. Unfortunately,
    there is a limited supply of colostrum. Algae provide an affordable and scalable
    system for the production of the valuable proteins found in colostrum. Recently,
    it was demonstrated that the use of antibiotics in livestock animals caused the

    having the animal livestock industry adapt a new product is demonstrating cost
    and feasibility. To accomplish the goal of decreasing antibiotic use, this project
    will first focus on optimizing the production process to drive the cost of producing
    colostrum proteins in algae down. Next, work will be done on developing optimal
    formulations of colostrum proteins and testing them in mice models before moving
    to larger livestock animals. Once an optimal formulation is established, trials
    will be done in pig models. In the pig models, colostrum proteins produced in
    algae will be tested to determine their ability to assist animals in fighting
    off infections and also their ability to improve the animal's rate of weight gain.
    Finally, this project will strive to demonstrate that colostrum proteins produced
    in algae can give the same positive outcomes in animals when compared to animals
    given antibiotics. By accomplishing these goals, algae colostrum proteins can
    drastically decrease the dependence on antibiotics and their negative side effects."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in the ability of the haloacetic acids (HAAs) analyzer proposed here to change how superintendents of drinking water utilities go about understanding their drinking water treatment plants. The HAAs analyzer will allow superintendents to continuously map, monitor and then optimize their drinking water treatment practices using detailed and high quality measurements on the federally-regulated HAAs, which are carcinogens. Optimizing of the water treatment practices using the HAAs analyzer will reduce chemical usage (save money) while simultaneously providing the highest quality drinking water for their customers by minimizing HAAs. The commercial U.S. market for Drinking Water chemicals, contract operations, consulting/engineering, instrument and testing is $19.3 billion. The entire U.S. Water industry market is $86.4 billion. The major target of this proposal is the 28,643 traditional community water systems serving 90 % of the U.S. population. Some water systems struggled to meet Stage 1 Disinfection By-Product (DBP) regulations. Stage 2 of these regulations is stricter. The DBP regulations address long-term (decades' timescale) exposure to HAAs. Superintendents can use the proposed HAAs analyzer to understand hourly, short-term variations in their treatment plants to enhance long-term minimization of HAAs.



    This project will commercialize the first state-of-the-art instrument for fully automated, on-site process monitoring of the drinking water disinfection by-products known as haloacetic acids (HAAs). The HAAs analyzer proposed here has the potential to significantly reduce the cost of water treatment through reduction of treatment chemical usage at the water treatment plant while simultaneously improving and stabilizing water quality with respect to the carcinogenic and federally regulated HAAs. Currently, most drinking water treatment plants use contract laboratories to determine HAAs concentrations in the distribution system. This approaches can take 2 - 3 weeks to return the results at a significant expense for the equivalent hourly data provided by the proposed HAAs analyzer. The research objectives for this Phase II SBIR proposal are to develop components for the HAAs analyzer to enable long-term, maintenance free operation with minimal operator intervention. Simultaneously, costs will be reduced for both construction and operation of the HAAs analyzer to establish commercial feasibility. The anticipated results will be a HAAs analyzer that will provide water treatment personnel individual and Total HAAs concentrations once per hour, on-site and automatically.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in the democratization of manufacturing through democratization of design and simulation technologies.  Geometric design systems and CAD tools are now widely available as standalone systems or cloud-based services, but simulation technologies remain inaccessible due to high cost, tedious data preparation, and demand of expertise in structural simulation. This project aims to make structural simulation widely available to both novice and expert users as a low cost fully automated service that requires no preprocessing or data conversion. The cloud-based simulation service is a disruptive technology that will make structural simulation widely available to communities of makers, as well as manufacturing enterprises, leading to dramatic improvements in performance, manufacturability, sustainability and cost savings. Wide adaption of simulation tools is also an important ingredient of STEM education and workforce development.


    This project will address the technical challenges identified in Phase I of the project, focusing on the goal of making cloud-based structural simulation service easily accessible and widely used. The key ingredients of the proposed approach are: (1) Development of novel user interaction modes and scenarios that enable rapid creation, composition, and editing of structural simulations by novice and expert users; (2) Guided interactive interpretation and exploration of simulation results aimed to not only to convey and explain simulation results, but also to engage the users into improving their designs by creating improved simulation scenarios. (3) Context-integrated simulations, where automated simulations are fully integrated with other services and delivered seamlessly within the context of common design or manufacturing applications, such as shape design, 3D printing, or manufacturability analysis.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of a pulmonary function testing
    device for detection and diagnosis of pulmonary conditions. Today more than 650
    million globally, nearly 10% of the world's population, suffer from lung conditions
    like Asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Currently, the most
    well-established method for lung function testing is spirometry, which requires
    the patient to conduct an unnatural breathing maneuver. In addition, spirometry
    cannot detect certain lung conditions. The proposed technology will be used without
    special breathing maneuver, and will be able to differentiate more lung conditions
    than spirometer. Since the proposed device can be used while the patient is breathing
    normally, it will also cater to currently under-served patient segments, e.g.
    young children and senior citizens, for detection and diagnosis of pulmonary conditions.
    By targeting a portable form-factor, the proposed technology will empower point-of-care
    pulmonary testing where it is currently infeasible.\n \nThe proposed project will
    develop the first handheld implementation of the well-studied principle of forced
    oscillation technique (FOT), where an acoustic pressure wave is sent via the mouth
    to a patient's lungs and reflections are used to measure lung function. Thus,
    no special breathing maneuver is required from the patient. Cognita Labs will
    adopt a modular approach for product design, and develop product-caliber advanced
    and integrated devices, that will include hardware, tablet app and EHR integration.
    The design will include all the innovations developed during Phase I to reduce
    the device size and cost while increasing its measurement accuracy. The proposed
    device will further develop and integrate a new ultra-sound based non-invasive
    sensor into the device to significantly reduce the cost of the consumable (disposable
    mouthpiece) and ultimately the cost of test. The team will also develop a new
    multi-resolution pre-screening test, with the objective to reduce bench time in
    outpatient clinics."

    known to provide an interactive experience that has revolutionized learning for
    children. Unfortunately, while these tablet devices are intuitive to utilize and
    easy for many children, those with disabilities are largely overlooked due to
    difficulties in effecting pinch-and-swipe gestures. This project thus addresses
    a direct need in our society by providing an integrated educational experience,
    focused on math education that addresses the diverse needs of children, while
    providing a solution for variations found in their disabilities. The contributions
    of this project include 1) the design of accessible math Apps usable by K-12 children
    with and without disabilities and 2) the design of apps that adapt educational
    content and provide feedback to parents and teachers based on real-time analytics.
    Given that there are over 93 million children worldwide living with a disability
    and, in the United States, children with disabilities are entitled to a free appropriate
    public education, there is a large potential of making both a commercial, as well

    As such, to address the growing utilization of tablets in the classroom environment,
    the specific research objectives of this effort include the design of methods
    that enable the embedding of educational math content into accessible tablet apps
    for training and evaluating cognitive skills, the design of methods that enable

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project aims to continue the development of a family of new nanostructured conductive additives for use in high-performance coatings and composite resins. Static charge buildup from the environment is a critical problem in a number of vehicular applications, which increasingly utilize lightweight components constructed from non-conductive plastic or composite materials.  Static charge buildup interferes with electronic components, such as distributed sensors, so that mitigation of this effect is essential for safe vehicle operation. The design of lightweight vehicles using composite materials, which requires high-performing antistatic coatings, will lead to large reductions in fuel consumption and carbon emissions in transportation.  In 2011, emissions from transportation accounted for 28% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Modern aircraft designs, utilizing composite materials, show more than 20% reduction in fuel consumption compared to traditional vehicles.  Imminent increases in fuel efficiency standards in automobiles will also drive manufacturers to adopt the use of composite materials. The development of the proposed antistatic coatings is essential to enabling these new lightweight material technologies.

    The new additives are based on the synthesis of self-assembling nanostructures from conductive polymers and structure-directing agents. When successfully incorporated in commercial paints and primers, the conductive properties of the coating are enhanced without compromising adhesion and durability. In this Phase II effort, we will further optimize these additives, based on key customer requirements, and develop a plan to scale up their production tenfold with reduced waste and production time.  Corrosion properties for marine applications will also be evaluated, and the product portfolio will be expanded to address follow-on applications.

    This SBIR Phase II project addresses the issue that while mobile devices hold great promise for education, most of the kids' apps that claim to be educational ultimately amount to little more than brain candy. Furthermore, the few apps that are based on educational research are resource-intensive to develop and therefore have limited opportunity to scale their success. This project is building an educational platform that addresses the problems of both quality and scale in this market. It is creating a content enhancement system designed specifically for creating research-based educational content that allows developers and content studios to build mobile and web apps at a fraction (10%-20%) of the cost of traditional app development. The content built using this system is automatically integrated with analytics and personalization technology that tailors the content to each child based on the child's responses. The personalization technology applies methods from psychometrics and cognitive development to ensure that the content adapts to the child and facilitates learning in an engaging way. The project will deliver a large library of context-based and personalized learning content for preK and primary grades that parents know is based on sound research, and ultimately helps increase school readiness and learning outcomes. Given the growing demand for age-appropriate mobile educational content for children, this project has the potential to generate significant returns as a commercial enterprise and, importantly, through the economic gains resulting from improvements in educational outcomes. It will also give content developers the opportunity to economically develop and deploy new content that uses personalization technology, without having to build this complex technology themselves, thereby applying this innovation at a large scale.

    This SBIR Phase II project is building a mobile game-based learning platform to onboard high quality third-party children's educational content and enhance their effectiveness through analytics and personalization. To achieve this, the project is developing two significant technical innovations: (1) a cloud-based personalization engine that powers adaptive learning in varied educational contexts and (2) a content enhancement system to efficiently and economically enrich third-party children's content (in the form of digital assets, books, or videos) with interactive learning games that are powered by the personalization logic. The personalization engine will use machine learning techniques combined with statistical methods of psychometric assessment and principles from cognitive development. It will inconspicuously measure children's interaction with the proposed platform's educational content and dynamically adjust game-play to suit each user's individual skills, interests and educational needs. The proposed model of leveraging and augmenting the efforts of many content developers is a dramatic departure from existing content development paradigms in this space. The goal of the project is to substantially increase the scale and reach of personalized, research-based learning experiences on mobile devices and ultimately maximize the potential of modern technology to deliver dynamic learning experiences.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project derives from the fact that increasing the reliability and robustness of cyber-physical systems (CPSs) will directly increase their adoption in real world applications. CPS technology is directly applicable to a broad range of sectors, including utility grids, smart buildings, manufacturing, healthcare, transportation, etc. These sectors account for more than $32.3 trillion in economic activity, with the potential to grow to $82 trillion by 2025 - about one half of the global economy. CPSs are thus critical to the national interest in areas such as manufacturing competitiveness, defense, health care, energy production and usage, and disaster monitoring and recovery. Due to the increasing reliance on CPSs in the future, system defects could have drastic consequences. The proposed technology could significantly improve reliability of CPSs by catching defects before they result in significant loss, outages, or failures.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop an efficient remote monitoring and diagnostic software system to detect and diagnose software defects in cyber-physical systems (CPSs). CPSs have the potential to bring about a revolution in efficiency, robustness, and safety in application domains such as smart utility grids and smart healthcare. To unleash their potential, CPSs must themselves be robust. However, despite state-of-the-art testing, software defects currently do escape into deployed CPSs. Current state-of-practice monitoring and diagnostic systems cannot improve the situation as they were not designed with the constraints of CPSs in mind, which include real-time execution, unreliable links, and resource constrained processors. The proposed technology is aimed at creating a software system capable of monitoring embedded nodes in CPSs for anomalies and providing detailed execution information to quickly diagnose the software defects responsible for any anomalies. The proposed work extends the company's extensive research in efficient collection of information for diagnosing software defects. The company expects to create a monitoring and diagnostic software system for CPSs and demonstrate its effectiveness on existing software defects in CPSs.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is significant; transitions of care impact millions of Americans every year. The healthcare system bears substantial cost and inefficiency&#8232;on account of suboptimal care transitions and overspending. This Phase II project will support progress towards a "learning healthcare system" and will extend the capabilities of data mining and machine learning in healthcare

    The proposed project seeks to improve data mining technologies for healthcare decision support. This project will focus on the analysis of a broad variety&#8232;of data types that are common in healthcare settings. The anticipated improvements would allow frontline care staff, operational managers, and healthcare executives to assess and make stronger evidence-driven decisions regarding quality, cost, and access as patients move through the healthcare system. The enhanced data mining system would utilize state-of-the-art pattern recognition and machine learning techniques to dynamically process and interpret clinical, claims, and other types of healthcare data. If successful, this research will impact the state-of-the-art in healthcare analytics.

    explore the applicability of a Gabor-domain optical coherence microscopy (GD-OCM)
    instrument to image and evaluate optical materials as part of the manufacturing
    process.  The immediate broader impact of this project is to effectively provide
    both qualitative and quantitative information about product quality in manufacturing,
    with an initial focus on contact lens manufacturing. Providing high-speed, industrial,
    micrometer-level resolution in all three dimensions, GD-OCM enables contact lens
    manufacturers to replace multiple inspection steps with a single measurement done
    automatically, reducing the opportunity for damaging the samples and human error,
    and ultimately leading to increased productivity and yield.  The resulting improvements
    in contact lens performance and extended wear effects are poised to have a positive
    impact on a significant percentage of the population.  Recent evaluations of GD-OCM
    have indicated its ability to provide a new wealth of characterization methods
    for quality control of various materials that are otherwise impossible to characterize
    nondestructively, including gradient refractive index polymers, glass and layered
    structures.  Additionally, GD-OCM will enable new advances in a wide variety of

    of a variety of material types. \n\nThe objective of this Phase II project is
    to establish the effectiveness of the emerging GD-OCM technology for nondestructive
    on-line metrology of contact lenses in manufacturing. Quality control and detection
    of product-significant defects, and a corresponding increase in production yield,
    represent the value proposition for the introduction of GD-OCM instrumentation
    into the contact lens production environment. The project will result in two major
    outcomes: 1) implementation of a robust production-environment instrument to effectively
    provide micrometer-level resolution in all three dimensions and quantification
    of yield-relevant contact lens quality metrics not previously available in a single
    instrument; and 2) demonstration of the technology for inspection in a production
    environment to rapidly and accurately monitor defects and quantify contact lens
    quality using product relevant metrics. This nondestructive, on-line optical inspection
    system can have significant impact not only on the process control and thereby
    yield of contact lenses, but also in manufacturing of layered materials in general,
    including polymers, plastics, and glass. Longer-term, the technology offers new
    paths for tissue imaging, guided surgery, and monitoring of eye disease."

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to discover digital methods to personalize reading instruction such that students understand more when they read, retain knowledge, and build lasting skills. The academic research on reading supports the claim that active reading strategies that incorporate quality instruction can benefit students. However, instruction is usually not personalized to meet the needs of specific students, and even when an educator works 1:1 with a student they can only interpret a limited number of signals from a student to help guide instruction. The objective of the project is to take in several inputs when students read digitally and investigate whether personalized reading instruction can effectively be created and delivered such that students get extra help when they struggle and are challenged when they can succeed on their own. Two-thirds of students in the U.S. are struggling readers; they cannot understand the main idea when they read. These students are four times more likely to drop out of school. People who read critically have more success in school, obtain high quality jobs, and are able to contribute more to expand social resources. Researchers and educators have been trying to solve the "reading gap" for decades, but only now does the technology exist to make this possible.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to use unique machine learning techniques to personalize reading instruction. The algorithms to personalize instruction will ensure that extra help, or scaffolding, is allocated to the students who need it, and removed when they no longer need it or when it threatens to become a crutch. This approach is different than other machine learning algorithms, which are built to minimize the overall error or maximize the overall reward. However, what is required for personalized reading instruction is different. The algorithm must learn how much to help a student not so they perform better with help, but so they perform better without it because the goal is for students to become better readers in the long term, not become reliant on scaffolding to read. The objective of the research is to fully develop and commercialize this personalized reading system and will involve data science, application development, and content authoring.

    up with explosive growth demand.  A core aspect of Internet operational viability
    is switching speed of optical devices at various points of the transmission, storage,
    calculation, and access chain.  Current technologies are not poised to be able
    to meet the speed and stability needs of the projected growth in Internet data
    volumes and access speed requirements.  These are currently growing well beyond
    a Moore's Law pace.  Needed is a disruptive approach to optical switching that
    will allow data management to keep pace with market needs.  Ability to delivery
    this essential capability will provide not only essential international leadership
    in internet services, but also avail companies involved in the innovation to make
    a substantial commercial impact directly for their shareholders and to those of
    their partners and affiliates.  \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research phase
    II project is an effort to cross the chasm between fundamental new physics insights
    relating to the structure of matter and an aggressive approach to commercializing
    'Semiconductors of Light' in an emerging market for high density optical interconnects
    priced for datacenters. Until recently, the only known photonic bandgap solids
    were photonic crystal structures consisting of regularly repeating, orderly lattices
    of dielectric materials. It was generally assumed that crystal order was essential
    to have photonic bandgaps. This longstanding assumption is now known to be false.
    New photonic bandgap structures, characterized by suppressed density fluctuations
    (hyperuniformity), include disordered structures that are isotropic. This means
    that light propagates the same way through the photonic solid independent of direction
    (which is impossible for a photonic crystal). While the layout of waveguides in
    conventional photonic crystal  and quasi crystal photonic bandgap materials is
    tightly-constrained to follow characteristic crystal axes, the layout rules for
    hyper uniform disordered solid waveguides have no such fundamental constraints.
    The universal protocol and highly-efficient computational framework covering the
    full range of photonic crystal, quasi crystal , and hyper uniform disordered solid-based
    photonic bandgaps will be generalized to a broad class of critically important
    photonic components by the application of a powerful new gradient-free optimization
    methods."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project are both technical and economic. The developed error-correction solutions will enable flash-memory-based devices to have higher capacities, higher reliability, and faster speeds at lower power while driving down the cost. This will have a major impact on mobile computing capabilities and enterprise storage by improving the efficiency and reliability of data centers, servers, and mission-critical storage that incorporate flash memories. Improved enterprise storage boosts the efficiency and growth of IT businesses, e-commerce, and financial trade. The solutions will also enable reduced power consumption and heat dissipation leading to greener systems.  The benefits of the error-correction solutions are also applicable to the hard disk drive and communications industries.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop and validate novel low-density parity-check (LDPC)-based error-correction for flash memory-based solid state drives (SSDs). SSDs are rapidly being deployed for both enterprise and consumer storage due to their fast speeds, low power, and low heat dissipation. But they bring numerous technical challenges stemming from the fact that reducing flash memory cell sizes leads to an unavoidable degradation in the reliability. With a trend of increasing die density to enable higher storage capacities, the industry is swiftly moving towards adopting LDPC codes to provide more powerful error-correction. However existing LDPC solutions use complex post-processing and multiple reads to bring down the error rates to the desired levels which lowers the read speeds, making them unattractive for future SSDs.  Novel binary LDPC-based solutions will be developed for a range of parameters, and validated in hardware.  The design method will be extended to develop new non-binary LDPC solutions which provide even greater reliability enhancements, leading to greater endurance in SSDs.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to allow a greater number of organizations,
    businesses, and individuals to access shortwave infrared (SWIR) imaging technology.
    Modern SWIR technology has existed for more than 40 years, but its expense has
    limited its use to the military and large corporations; this project is grounded
    in the belief that when everyone has access to SWIR technology, the benefits to
    society are exponential.  SWIR image sensors have potential applications in food
    safety analysis (e.g., identifying harmful adulterated foods and revealing sub-surface
    flaws in produce), manufacturing (e.g., sorting), security (e.g., night vision),
    medical sensing (e.g., vein mapping and blood oxygenation monitoring), and the
    automotive field (e.g., night/inclement weather vision systems and for self-driving
    vehicles). A low-cost sensor will open the SWIR imaging market to players in these
    fields who have so far been shut out due to price. In addition, a low-cost, high-quality
    sensor will also make SWIR imaging directly available to the general public for
    the first time ever in the form of a SWIR camera smartphone add-on, establishing
    a new market for SWIR imaging. \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
    Phase II project will produce low-cost germanium (Ge)-based shortwave infrared
    (SWIR) image sensors with features superior to those of currently available SWIR
    sensors. The research objective is to resolve issues of resolution, power usage,
    size, and sensitivity that limit advancement in the SWIR imaging field. This project
    will address these problems by utilizing a unique Ge-based SWIR sensor structure.
    In addition, a monolithic method of integrating the image sensor material onto
    the Si readout integrated circuit will be pursued. This will enable precise alignment
    of the readout integrated circuit  and the imaging device, which will lead to
    smaller pixel size and better resolution. Finally, issues of power use and sensitivity
    will be addressed through an innovative structure called Gate-controlled Charge
    Modulate Device. Research will focus on refining and improving the fabrication
    processes necessary to reliably produce low-cost, high-quality Ge-based SWIR image
    sensors."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in significantly lowering the cost of high precision glass molding through a low-cost carbide-bonded graphene coating. In optical industry, optical glasses have been the de facto choice. These lenses are used in cameras, projection systems and military equipment. However, cost and other considerations frequently lead to the choice of injection molded plastic lenses with their acceptable but lower image quality. The innovative carbide-bonded graphene coatings are both low cost and durable, and could allow use of precision optical glasses in places where plastic products are used today. The coatings also have the potential to spread to other markets such as advanced thermal management, next generation electronic components, and biosensors based on the unique combination of excellent mechanical, physical, optical transparency and biocompatibility properties together with tunable optoelectronic characteristics. Such products may greatly improve our daily lives in areas such as portable electronics and optics, energy saving and green manufacturing.


    This project will further advance the chemically vapor deposited carbide-bonded graphene coating process demonstrated during Phase I that involved using silicon wafers with micro/nano-patterning. With the help of our industrial partners we now intend to scale the technology to the commercial level.  The process development is targeted to developing low-cost and mass-producible high precision glass molding, micro-optics, and NIR aspheric optics for cell phones and high performance laser collimators. These activities would also enhance our understanding of carbide-bonded graphene coating technology.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aligns with a major shift in healthcare to reduce hospital acquired infections. At a cost of over $1.5B and 600,000 extra hospital days in the US alone, surgical wound infection in high-risk abdominal surgery patients is a major healthcare burden. In addition, providers and hospitals face greater scrutiny of their wound infection rates today, and the sweeping changes of healthcare reform have incentivized these critical stakeholders to invest in preventative solutions. However, currently available solutions are insufficient, and existing surgical device companies have not developed a compelling pipeline of products to address this unmet need. The proposed technology enjoys a competitive advantage in that it operates in a relatively open competitive landscape, and its unique mechanism of action provides a comprehensive wound protection strategy. Thus, this technology has the potential to make a significant worldwide impact on wound infection, both from a healthcare quality and commercialization standpoint. The initial market for this technology is in colorectal surgery, with ample expansion opportunities into other abdominal surgical markets totaling over $1 billion.


    The proposed project seeks to develop and commercialize a novel technology designed to prevent one of the most frequent, morbid, and costly hospital-acquired infections: surgical wound infection. The technology is an innovative surgical tool that provides a comprehensive anti-contamination strategy for the wound that is also user-friendly for the surgeon. This device has the potential to be a transformative innovation in the quality of surgical care, particularly in the 3.5 million patients undergoing high-risk abdominal-gastrointestinal (GI) surgery in whom wound infections are the most common. The technology also allows surgeons to experiment with a variety of approaches to identify ?best practices? for intraoperative wound care. This Phase II project proposes three main objectives. First, the company will refine the scientific understanding of the local and systemic therapeutic of the anti-contamination therapy through numerical modeling and pre-clinical testing in a porcine model in order to provide clinical use recommendations. Second, the company will design and develop a product sized for laparoscopic surgeries in order to support a broad-based commercialization effort. Third, the company with develop scaled manufacturing capability to support commercial release of the CleanCision product platform.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project derives from an enhanced capability for automated processing of free text and other structured data.  Motivation for this approach comes from neural networks and, in turn, it has applications to neural modeling and our understanding of how the brain processes information.  In the software industry, commercial innovation continues to revolve around automated processing of web pages, which plays a key role in creating many new companies.  Therefore, the ability to automate decision-making from free text is increasing in importance. A better way to represent text for use with machine learning will open new capabilities wherever the structure of sentences must be taken into account.  This has the potential to lead to new startup ventures, thereby resulting in new products and services. A successful project will result in platform technology that can provide a substantial competitive edge to companies that take advantage of it, provide new and better capabilities for consumers, and help advance the nation's lead in technological innovation.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to further develop new ways to process textual material so that computers can better learn applications related to natural language.  Applications include sentiment analysis (assigning either positive or negative views to a body of text), summarization of documents, and classification of documents using multiple labels from a fixed set of many classes.  The project will further develop new techniques to improve performance, and prototype components for transforming text and applying computerized learning methods. The new techniques represent words simultaneously with document structure using a single high-dimensional vector (for example, a list of 1,000 numbers).  The project is aimed at improving computational capabilities involving documents, web pages, and other text as well as providing new techniques that can be applied to automated translation, better computer understanding of images, and genomic information.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in detecting sepsis early in its course, before end organ damage when it is most treatable. Sepsis, an uncontrolled systemic response to local infection by bacteria or fungi, is responsible for more deaths than prostate cancer, breast cancer, and AIDS combined and is associated with ~$17B in annual U.S. healthcare expenditures. We anticipate that providing emergency department physicians with an earlier diagnostic will profoundly influence clinical outcomes (currently ~40% mortality), costs (>$22,000/case), and the quality of life for survivors and their families. Accumulating evidence connects systemic immune activation ? a key process in sepsis ? with single-cell architectural changes that are mechanically measured by high-speed mechanical phenotyping technology. This technology is well-suited for adult sepsis screening in the emergency department (market size of $1.5B) due to: (1) the functional analysis of cell state the mechanical measurement provides, (2) its high achievable throughput and therefore statistical accuracy, (3) exceedingly short turnaround time, (4) low cost of goods, and (5) the clinically-actionable information it provides. Beyond the adult sepsis screening market, several additional indications include neonatal sepsis, bladder cancer detection, academic research tools, and drug development.


    The proposed project brings an innovative new class of biomarkers to bear on a problem that has been intractable with current biomarkers.  Briefly, the physical properties of cells have been known to be important for decades, but only with the advent of breakthrough microfluidic technology have we been able to measure these parameters in a high-throughput manner capable of diagnosing disease.  This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II award will be used to develop and validate innovative sample preparation and image analysis modules for a sepsis screening technology as well as performance of proof-of-concept clinical studies that would be a flagship offering in using biomechanical biomarkers to diagnose disease. The technical objectives are designed to improve sensitivity to white blood cells, activated during sepsis, by microfluidic automation of sample preparation and optimization of the microscopic imaging optics. In addition to preparing the test for practical implementation in the emergency department, the test will be validated with a proof-of-concept clinical study, and a clinical scoring system will be devised.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to increase the efficiency of identifying, mapping, and remediating water sources contaminated with chlorinated solvents.  Chlorinated solvents are used in vast quantities as solvents and degreasing agents, and in the dry cleaning industry. The necessity of monitoring chlorinated solvents in water will continue for many generations due to their widespread occurrence in water sources around the world, their toxicity, and their high stability. A significant need exists and will grow for devices that can continuously measure the concentration of chlorinated organic chemicals in water, and that can do so accurately and inexpensively. Continuous in-situ data production in the field of environmental sensing will greatly increase efficiency in all processes that require a measurement of these chemicals, having a significant impact on the costs and timelines associated with remediation of contaminated sites. This sensor will allow for continuous monitoring of possible contamination sources in the case of a contamination event. Also, it will afford easy profiling of contamination plumes in aquifers. This technology will replace the current laboratory-based measurement protocols, which are not readily adapted for in-situ, on-line, or in-the-field measurements, and cannot produce data continuously.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop an optical enzymatic biosensor for continuous, quantitative monitoring of chlorinated solvent concentrations in water. Chlorinated solvent contamination of groundwater is a widespread ongoing issue around the world. The biosensing concept will be implemented in an optical fiber format, in which optical biosensor tips are linked to a small electro-optical unit. Analyte detection takes place on biosensor tips that are coated with enzymes and fluorescent chemicals. The scope of the research includes two parallel strategies for obtaining highly stable detection enzymes such that long lifetime sensors are achievable, development of a system to deliver required reagents to the sensing tip, development of signal processing algorithms to enable high accuracy measurements in variable environmental conditions and speciation of chlorinated compounds within mixtures, a manufacturing study for high throughput fabrication of the sensors, and field testing of the device at multiple contamination sites. Attainment of these objectives will advance the sensing technology to a robust and readily manufactured system for chlorinated solvent monitoring with low detection limits, high accuracy, and reliability.

    The broader impact/ commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is aimed at reducing the impact of knee arthritis and improving the quality of life for those suffering from this debilitating condition, while simultaneously strengthening the bond between academia and industry by providing students with unique research opportunities through the development of a novel Total Knee Replacement technology.  Over 600,000 total knee replacement procedures are performed annually, comprising 8% of all Medicare spending.  Total hospital charges for this procedure approached $40 billion for 2012.  The revision rates for this procedure are significant: 10% at 10 years and 20% at 20 years.  Considering the aging population of the United States, the number of total knee replacements and revisions are steadily increasing and the majority of these will be completed under Medicare coverage.  The primary cause for revision surgery is loosening of the implants.  This innovation aims to develop an anchoring method for implantable orthopedic devices that will reduce the total number of revision procedures performed by creating a more stable interface between the bone and the device, and therefore enhance the scientific and technological understanding of orthopedic implants in general.

    The proposed project is a device that utilizes structural engineering principles such as load transfer and truss design to improve osteo-incorporation of a total knee replacement implant; such a device is likely to be more efficacious than current designs.  Currently available systems suffer from significant revision rates after being implanted only a short while.  With younger patients receiving these implants, devices need to be developed that will give the mobility and quality of life required by these patients.  The novel web structure fixing the tibial tray of a total knee replacement into the bone should provide improved initial fixation, reduce micro-motion, and eliminate aseptic loosening, all of which contribute towards a reduced revision rate and improved patient comfort.  After using the information gained from the Phase I SBIR investigation to inform computational models, the design of this device will be finalized.  The device will then be subjected to rigorous mechanical testing to investigate its performance in vivo, while simultaneously serving to satisfy the testing requirements mandatory for FDA approval.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project, if successful, will have immediate value for the pharmaceutical industry by accelerating research and discovery of new drugs, and also increasing production efficiency and safety. The technology also is applicable in many other sectors; e.g., monitoring natural polymers, such as dissolution of gelatin used in food or pharmaceutical applications, flocculation of impurities by water purification polymers, entrapment of oil by surfactants and other agents used in combating oil spills, and more.  The quantitative kinetics of molecular weight changes during all these processes will allow deeper understanding of the fundamental physical and chemical forces that drive them. Therefore, many commercial and scientific opportunities exist for the proposed technology, yielding the potential for significant impact across multiple industries. With demonstrated feasibility on applications in protein therapeutics and early adoption by several key users, the initial market for this technology and instrumentation could expand quickly, and sales could reach $10M within several years of delivering a commercial product.  The overall market for the technology will increase in time as other application sectors are developed.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop a new technology for monitoring aggregation in therapeutic protein solutions, which will have wide-ranging impact in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. Protein aggregation is a major problem across these sectors engaged in developing new protein pharmaceuticals. Protein aggregation can elicit immune responses against the protein itself, severely reduce bioavailability, and is a significant hurdle in the drug development pipeline. This new technology can simultaneously and quantitatively monitor the stability of many independent protein formulations for hours, days, months, or longer, all under the control of a single instrument and without any significant human intervention.  Because the technology is based on laser light scattering, it provides a rigorous means of monitoring the protein aggregation process.  It is based on fundamental laws of physics, and not on empirical or inferential means. The implementation and use of this technology could revolutionize drug discovery, formulation, and quality control dimensions and accelerate development of new drugs while making existing ones safer and more efficiently produced.  The technology can be used wherever proteins are under development for fighting diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer's, diabetes, and various forms of cardiovascular disease.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project extends to wherever headphones are used to listen to sound. The first commercial markets targeted by the technology being developed are gaming, virtual reality and consumer entertainment. These are areas in which the US has strong market and technology leads. By the end of the project, the company intends to have developed software that can be licensed to major players in these areas, reaching tens of millions of users. Beyond these markets, there are many applications for spatial audio in human-computer interfaces to deliver spatial information along with the intended semantic message. Several niche markets also exist, such as data presentation/exploration via sonification and specifically designed auditory interfaces for vision-impaired users. Overall it is expected that the proposed R&D work will advance the state of the art in science and technology and will be of substantial value to society as a whole due to high usability, fidelity, naturalness, and portability of the developed spatial audio solutions.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to develop highly realistic and computationally efficient software for synthesis of personalized spatial audio, for applications that include virtual reality, gaming, and prostheses for the blind. Current algorithms are either perceptually unsatisfactory or have very high computational load. Approximate modeling of sound propagation, reverberation, and diffusion, along with tradeoffs between complexity and quality, will be explored using perceptual distortion metrics combined with the skills of professional listeners. The software will be optimized for use on mobile, console and embedded platforms. Additionally, a method to personalize the software to individual listeners, which was previously developed and tested in laboratory conditions, will be further refined and ruggedized for use in realistic environments. The expected outcomes will include a high-quality and efficient audio rendering library, a portable personalization apparatus, and several demonstrations that highlight the capabilities of the technology.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to increase the competitiveness of U.S. semiconductor industry by improving the quality of A/MS design verification, improving first pass design success and reducing time-to-market. Today, current analog verification methods and tools often fail to catch design mistakes, especially due to unforeseen interactions across chip subsystems, and these mistakes are a frequent cause of costly delays in bringing products to market even on chips where analog is only a small portion of the overall design ? a $63 billion market. The costs and lost profit potential related to multiple design versions can quickly run to millions of dollars and easily dwarfs the cost of providing designers access to the appropriate design tools. Using two different market analyses, the first using a digital verification market analogy and the second considering worldwide new (not slight derivatives) designs in just the AMS IC market, leads to an estimation of total available market for new analog verification solutions of $300 million annual revenue. Further extending the verification solutions with analytics and collaboration tools can potentially increase the market by a further 50% to $450 million annual revenue. Understanding A/MS verification coverage is a key component of this opportunity.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project proposes a verification coverage system for analog/mixed-signal (A/MS) integrated circuit development. Verification of today?s complex integrated circuits and systems is widely acknowledged as a critical challenge to improving design productivity. Part of the verification challenge revolves around understanding what portion of the operating space has been examined; i.e., ?covered?. Today well-accepted formal and simulation-based techniques exist to capture and measure test coverage for digital integrated circuits, but there is no corresponding commercial capability for analog and mixed-signal integrated circuits. Analog designers frequently spend too much time analyzing and over-testing system behavior for a small set of well understood usage scenarios while leaving significant portions of the state-space completely untested. The design exploration problem for A/MS circuits presents a critical challenge for implementing such systems due to the inherently large design space associated with these types of circuits. Key objectives for the project include productizing and extending key components demonstrated in the Phase 1 prototype. This project will deliver a commercial product to provide A/MS verification coverage data that is actionable and facilitates collaboration between design and verification teams. The resulting product will have scalability and performance to handle large complex designs.

- abstractText: "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will
    prototype, characterize, and verify performance merits and the commercial viability
    of an Adaptive Dual-Fuel (ADF) Injector. Diesel engines are 30~40% more efficient
    than port-injected gasoline, spark-ignited engines. Gasoline and E85 fuels are
    among the most widely available fuels, but are mostly used on spark-ignition gasoline
    engines with much lower thermal efficiency than diesel engines. The key innovation
    of the ADF injector enables direct-injections of both gasoline/E85 and diesel
    fuel selectively on-demand from a single injector. The ADF injector can enable
    advanced combustion modes that have demonstrated simultaneous reduction of NOx
    and Particulate Matter (PM) emissions and improved engine efficiency through advanced
    low temperature combustion. The advanced combustion mode enabled by the ADF injector
    can improve the thermal efficiency of gasoline/E85 engines by approximately 30~40%
    by using gasoline and/or E85 fuels in a compression ignition combustion mode.
    The adaptive dual-fuel injector also provides flexibility for enabling engines
    to run on either pure diesel, gasoline-diesel, or E85-diesel dual fuels. The Phase
    II work includes prototyping, spray visualization imaging and laser based measurements,
    computational optimization, and single-cylinder engine combustion testing to demonstrate
    the commercial viability of the proposed ADF injector. \n\n\nThe broader/commercial
    impacts of this project pertain to significant benefits for energy security and
    environmental protection. The potential customers include engine OEMs and auto
    makers. This project will significantly benefit US consumers through fuel cost
    saving, enable low cost methods to meet the new CAFE standards, and benefit the
    US economy by expanding the ?green? manufacturing base. The dual fuel injector,
    developed and analyzed in this work, provides new capabilities, which can enable
    transformative combustion methods for ultra-high efficiency, clean combustion.
    The industry-university collaborative engineering research directly support graduate
    student research and will train and educate the workforce of the future, providing
    them with the knowledge and skills needed to address the challenges of energy
    utilization. The research and development efforts, which focus on a critical problem
    of global importance, will be widely disseminated to engine designers, OEMs, and
    researchers, while the next generation of engineers is being trained."

    positron emission tomography (PET) imaging products to manage neurodegenerative
    disorders, cancer, and cardiovascular disease. PET is now a key diagnostic and
    management tool in oncology, and compounds labeled with [18F]-fluoride provide
    optimal signal to noise ratios and resolution in medical imaging applications.
    Ground Fluor Pharmaceuticals (GFP) developed proprietary single-step fluorination
    technology that allows [18F]-labeled medicines to be prepared efficiently from
    cyclotron-produced [18F]-fluoride. Under this Phase II research project GFP will
    apply its new technology to produce the imaging agent 6- [18F]fluoro-L-DOPA (FDOPA),
    a compound useful in diagnosing Parkinson's disease and in cancer imaging, that
    is not currently readily available because of the difficulty in its production.
    GFP will scale-up and manufacture pharmaceutical grade ALPDOPA (GFP's precursor
    to FDOPA) under pharmaceutical cGMP conditions, and offer this material for research
    studies and for clinical imaging. GFP will develop an FDA drug master file and
    will provide technical and regulatory assistance to cyclotron pharmacy customers
    adopting GFP's technology for commercial production of FDOPA. In addition to helping
    to bring this valuable imaging agent to market, GFP will assist academic and pharmaceutical
    research groups in the development of new [18F]- fluorinated imaging products.
    \n\nThe broader impact/commercial potential is to expand the scope and utility
    of PET as medical diagnostic tool, thereby improving treatment and management
    of serious medical problems. Although [18F]-fluoride possesses, perhaps, the most
    advantageous properties for imaging, is relatively inexpensive, and is widely
    available, it is difficult to incorporate into medicines for imaging. GFP has
    developed a general enabling technology that uses the relatively inexpensive and
    widely available form of [18F]-fluoride to create new molecular imaging agents
    to advance personalized medicine. This technology, and the compounds it creates,
    will provide the physician with new opportunities to diagnose, assess, and more
    efficiently treat unmet medical needs. The manufacturing technology developed
    here is a broad platform applicable to the preparation of a wide range of new

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project anticipates bringing forth a disruptive mouth guard technology that answers the urgent need for better dental protection.  In the US alone, every year more than 1 million dental injuries occur, resulting in medical costs of roughly $500 million.  The proposed technology will involve novel manufacturing methods to incorporate energy absorbing solid/liquid suspensions into novel thermo-polymer mouth guard designs to achieve enhanced impact energy absorption capacity.  The specific technical objectives are to optimize the energy absorbing capacity of the formulated solid/liquid suspensions, develop the necessary manufacturing technology for incorporating such solid/liquid suspensions monolithically into the thermo- polymer, and finally to characterize the mouth guards by subjection to stress testing (chemical, physical, and thermal).  This energy absorbing mouth guard will deliver on-demand, tunable energy absorption capacity that can be specifically tailored to provide superior dental protection to users in several venues including medical, sports, industrial and military.  This R&D effort will produce the first ever mouth guard made with material that adaptively absorbs impact energy, a stark technological contrast to the conventional (passive) mouth guard.   This new technology will also contribute basic understanding to the emerging field of nanorheology.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is significant.  In just the mouth guard arena, realizing this technologically advanced mouth guard will likely bring a novel product into the dental protection market. Then there is the untapped market to provide much needed dental protection for patients undergoing medical procedures. Yearly about 150,000 dental injuries occur just during endotracheal intubations, required when undergoing general anesthesia.  Further, the new energy absorbing fluid-thermopolymer material technology  to emerge  could  serve  as  the  technical  groundwork  for  a  plethora  of  energy dampening products.  In addition, the research stands to seed a new body of knowledge, small- scale (millimeter) leveraged use of energy absorptive fluids.   Realizing the technical objectives of this Phase II R&D effort will help foster local economic growth when the company?s new manufacturing facility opens for the fabrication of mouth guards based on this technology.  A large number of jobs will be created requiring very diverse technical skills, and the company is committed to fill these jobs with a diverse work force.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will determine the technical feasibility and the commercial value proposition for high temperature, highly processable fiber optic coatings across a range of markets to include fiber lasers, fibers for oil and gas, avionics fiber, and medical fiber. Tetramer will perform research to modify the structure of polymer coatings to provide enhanced performance which will extend the capabilities of current fiber optics. Coatings developed will advance our understanding of structure property relationships and establish new boundaries for the polymer system. During this program, Tetramer will synthesize new monomers and polymers and evaluate their properties for use as fiber coatings. At the end of this program, Tetramer anticipates it will have developed 3 new types of polymers with a set of performance characteristics which are not available from any one single material today. New fiber coatings will be developed which are capable of operating at temperatures above 300 deg C, having greater processability, and for laser applications, having lower refractive indices.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will impact society in many ways due to the various markets in which the coatings can have a meaningful impact on the optical fiber performance. Fiber optic lasers are quickly becoming the preferred method for laser fabrication. By enabling fiber lasers to operate at higher temperatures, fiber lasers will immediately see increased output powers and longer service lifetimes. With applications in industrial metal working (welding, cutting, and engraving/marking), micromachining, and medical devices, doubling power output via improved coatings will have a major impact across many industries. Higher temperature fiber coatings will improve down-hole drilling and the overall efficiency of oil drilling operations through better temperature monitoring in deep wells. This has the potential to lower prices of oil and increase oil production. Additionally, these fibers can aid in geothermal well monitoring which would provide a green source of energy. The coatings under development have the potential to generate increased revenue and profit throughout the value chain through increased performance of products and enhanced market sizes through enhanced capabilities. Tetramer will also use this Phase II program to train undergraduate and graduate level students from nearby Clemson University

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will advance the technology research and development necessary to bring wireless instrumentation and smartphone technology used for feedback to lower-limb amputees about their real-time performance, for rehabilitation in situ. The intellectual merit of the proposed research lies in the opportunity to transform the field of rehabilitation and to advance healthcare by enabling a fundamental shift toward low cost, ubiquitous rehabilitation that can be used away from the clinic. This proposal will research and develop the pre-market alpha- and beta-prototypes of an instrumented insole, smartphone app, and HIPAA-compliant data transfer and remote server storage and analysis system, as an essential and transformative tool utilized for physical therapy and gait training outside of the clinic. While sensors have become small, inexpensive, and highly available, many research lab applications are limited to proof-of-concept evaluations that involve tethered systems and/or post-processing of the data. This research quantifies the effect of this low-cost, personalized, wireless assistive technology that can be used away from the clinic. Ultimately, this work lays a foundation for more complex rehab feedback systems, e.g. using a smartphone to detect gait and provide feedback to an orthotic or prosthetic for muscle stimulation.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes the focus on mobility limitations in persons with lower-limb amputations, which affect twice as many minorities as Caucasians. The commercial potential of this wireless assistive technology is vast: with diabetes as the major contributor to amputations, the number of amputees is forecast to triple to 3.6 million by 2050. The knowledge gained can be expanded to impact individuals with a wide variety of mobility limitations, e.g. stroke, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy, etc. The orthopedic market ? 773,000 total hip/knee replacements performed annually in U.S. ? is also commercially relevant, as patients must affect an asymmetric gait following fracture repair or joint replacement to reduce weight-bearing on the healing limb. Another significant group are athletes seeking to improve performance or recover from injury through precision gait analysis and real-time feedback. In this Phase II proposal, this research will quantify the effect of this wireless assistive technology by enabling persons with amputations to use individualized proprioceptive feedback and to participate in the design of the personalized feedback methods. This work will enable a wealth of information collected away from the clinic, including a way to investigate how and whether patients follow treatment protocols.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will address two societal needs. It will enable mass charging infrastructure for electric vehicles (EVs) at minimal cost, and will enable the provisioning of energy services to help integrate renewable energy
    sources. This is critical as electricity generation and transportation together consume close to two-thirds of all US energy and emit more than half of all US greenhouse gases. To drastically reduce greenhouse gases will therefore require electrification of our
    transportation and renewable generation of our electricity. California (CA) has a mandate to have 1.5 million zero-emission vehicles by 2025 and, currently, half of the nation's EVs are in CA. If the project is successful, the proposed technology, when deployed at scale,
    can potentially save CA $144M annually in operating costs and $1.1B in capital cost when CA reaches its ambitious goal by 2025. This can help reduce greenhouse gases annually in CA by 5.5 million metric tons. This project will therefore make an impact in both clean
    transportation and clean energy.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project will develop an adaptive EV charging system that can implement a number of innovations that are not currently available in the EV charging industry. It will offer a site host a solution to recover costs,
    jointly optimize onsite distributed energy resources such as solar panels and battery banks, minimize operating cost for site host and charging cost for drivers, and optimally trade off preferences and constraints of different drivers and of the site host, subject to
    infrastructure capacity constraints. These technologies will be based on unique real-time sensing, communications, and control capabilities, as well as advanced optimization and learning algorithms. These technologies will provide a target charging capacity at minimal infrastructure and operating costs, as well as a platform for energy services to the grid.

    This SBIR Phase II project will benefit society by reducing the cost of manufacturing biologic pharmaceuticals and improving their quality, including pharmaceuticals that are currently too costly to manufacture because they target relatively small patient populations. In order to accelerate the availability of newly discovered drugs, the pharmaceutical industry and federal regulatory agencies have identified a great need for advances in process analytical technologies (PATs) in biomanufacturing. This project will advance state-of-the-art PAT by providing a continuous in-situ sensor enabling novel methods of drug quality assurance. This multi-analyte sensor will allow biopharmaceutical companies, for the first time, to monitor the concentration of the product in-situ as it is being produced along with the concentrations of other important cell culture conditions. This ability unlocks new avenues for optimizing biopharmaceutical production which consumes about 35% of the biologic drug cost-of-goods. Efficient control of upstream processes using sensors such as the one proposed here is expected to reduce these costs by up to 30%. Furthermore, this technology can be directed towards other analytes by replacing the bound affinity ligands. Thus, this technology can be used as a sensing platform in biopharmaceutical manufacturing or medical diagnostics, food processing, and water quality monitoring.

    This project will advance scientific knowledge of biosensing, hydrogel chemistry, and process analytics by developing the first continuous monoclonal antibody (mAbs) sensor suitable for biomanufacturing. Remarkable progress has been made in developing affinity ligands that specifically bind to targets, but thus far the primary application has been medical therapeutics. This project will develop a biosensor adapting affinity ligands, aptamers in particular, for the first time for application in bioprocess monitoring. This will be accomplished by synthesizing the first antibody-responsive hydrogel containing covalently attached peptide aptamers. Each of the four objectives will focus on hydrogels, electronics, software and system validation respectively. The mAb biosensor will be capable of monitoring quality and yield of mAbs besides the key parameters: pH, osmolality, glucose, and lactate in cell culture environments. This novel hydrogel will be the basis for the first in-situ bioreactor sensor for real-time antibody measurements during biomanufacturing. This adaptable technology can be leveraged towards a number of protein targets; thus, this project represents a transformative approach that will advance scientific knowledge of biosensing across a multitude of applications. Thus, the proposed sensor array will be a powerful tool to advance process analytics and biomanufacturing.

    This SBIR Phase II project will develop a personalized learning environment for guiding students in effective use of educational sketching in Science Technology Engineering and Math (STEM). There is an estimated need for 1 million more STEM professionals in the U.S. over the next decade. However, the dropout rate for students in STEM majors ranges from 48% to 69%. Recent reform in mathematics education in the U.S. has focused on sketching and modeling so that students have a better understanding of the problems they are solving rather than rote memorization. Sketching is also important for improving the ability to visualize three dimensional shapes in engineering, medicine, and science. Teaching sketching has been shown to increase retention in STEM by over 50% among students entering college with low spatial visualization skills, especially among women and other underrepresented minorities. However, the traditional method of sketching on paper requires teaching expertise and classroom time, which has limited its use. Our touchscreen software will improve upon sketching on paper, by providing immediate feedback and intelligent hints when students are stuck. A key advantage of our approach is that it can reward persistence by having students retry a sketching assignment until they get it right, as opposed to multiple-choice questions that can only be tried once. Impact will include improved conceptual understanding in K-6 mathematics and STEM education at all levels.


    This project will develop an intelligent learning environment where students can freehand sketch on a touchscreen phone, tablet, or computer. They will receive personalized feedback based on the sketches they draw to improve their conceptual understanding and promote persistence. The software algorithms developed will automatically grade student sketches and provide hints that are just enough to keep the student engaged but not so much as to give away the solution. An expert teacher knows that developing skill and increasing persistence requires that students struggle a bit as they overcome obstacles to learn new concepts. The algorithm for interpreting student sketches and providing hints will mimic an expert teacher looking over the shoulder of the student. By interpreting student intent in their sketches, the algorithm will be able to distinguish between intentional marks and unintentional ones that are due to poor coordination or sloppiness. Subject areas include elementary school mathematics, spatial visualization for 7-12th grade technical education, post-secondary vocational and engineering programs, and eventually physics, geology, medicine and other STEM areas. This project will replace sketching on paper and pencil with widely available touchscreens, and make educational sketching more effective and engaging.

    This SBIR Phase II project will develop a drug delivery technology to address the unmet need of antiproliferative drug delivery below-the-knee. In the United States, there are 323,000 new critical limb ischemia (CLI) patients each year. CLI is the most severe stage of peripheral artery disease (PAD), atherosclerosis of the lower limbs. Ultimately, 40% of CLI patients will undergo lower limb amputation as a result of CLI, half of whom will then die within a year. Existing technologies have failed in these vessels, resulting in higher rates of patient amputation. This project will create a better intravascular drug delivery tool to treat PAD patients after angioplasty. This improved drug delivery will provide three key societal benefits: 1) reduced costs and greater efficiency when revascularizing the vessels of critical limb ischemia patients, 2) a reduction in healthcare costs by reducing repeat procedures, and 3) improved patient outcomes resulting from improved drug delivery achieved using image guidance. If successful, this technology may improve patient health while reducing treatment costs for millions of patients around the world. This will also improve understanding of what aspects of CLI treatment are most effective by offering the flexibility to vary different aspects of drug delivery. When completed, this project will enhance the understanding of intravascular drug delivery with ultrasound and microbubbles.

    This project will provide strong technical innovation through a new ultrasound drug delivery device and new methods to evaluate cardiovascular drug delivery devices. Using a combination of intravascular ultrasound and drug loaded microbubbles, this project will provide better localization of delivery with lower drug doses. This project will then evaluate the drug delivery platform using realistic models of human disease from donated tissue combined with routine techniques (histopathology) and more recent advances (microCT) to evaluate the effect of the disease on drug delivery. The core research objective of this project is to deliver paclitaxel to human diseased arteries with the new intravascular ultrasound and microbubble drug delivery platform. It is anticipated that this project will result in an improved drug uptake over the existing technologies in diseased arteries where drug uptake is poorest. The data and techniques from this project will be used to compel adoption among interventionalists and to validate the the drug delivery system as a tool to prevent amputations in CLI patients.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to lay a foundation for vehicle to infrastructure communication focused on applications that add direct value to mobility. Many solutions are focused on getting information to the vehicle, while it is often the infrastructure that requires vehicle information to operate more efficiently. Currently, traffic signals enforce the right-of-way of everyone regardless of in-vehicle technology. This is why optimizing their effects on the road network can provide tremendous benefit. There are significant benefits to transit as well, like buses and light rail that, when given priority at intersections, improves on-time performance which is a major factor in ridership rates.

    The proposed project advances the work of the joint standardization of the National Transportation Communications for Intelligent Transportation Systems Protocol (NTCIP) to achieve interoperability between various traffic signal controller vendors to enable shared control and organization between different operating agencies. It is not unusual to have sections of roadway be managed by local, county, and state within the same small area. These overlapping jurisdictions produce fractures within the road network resulting in the asynchronous timing of traffic signals. The aim is to consolidate the management into a signal network capable of coordinating large areas of traffic signals to increase mobility's overall efficiency. With a cloud solution that is capable of speaking to each networked intersection, vehicle telemetry data and route information can be used to proactively optimize signal timing. Working with prioritized vehicles such as buses, fire trucks, and ambulances, pilot studies will be conducted to perform priority and preemption along routes that cross jurisdictions. Each pilot case will be analysed based on key performance indicators set forth by the agencies.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) project is to allow for the recycling of valuable materials from
    complex wastes that today cannot be recovered. The commercial impact from this
    innovation is to allow for complex waste streams that contain multiple materials,
    such as textiles, to serve as the source of raw materials for the manufacture
    of new goods in a way that is cost advantaged. This gives those businesses that
    use such raw materials a sustainable alternative and importantly, a lower-cost,
    efficiently produced material. In this way, there will be significant incentive
    for the reuse of thousands of tons of material that today either goes to landfills,
    oceans, or is incinerated for energy, a very low value application. A funded,
    successful project will yield an entirely new framework for recycling of complex,
    multi-component materials.    \n\nThis SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop
    novel technologies for fractionating complex wastes. Multi-component wastes such
    as textiles represent upwards of 4% of total landfill volume. Today, there does
    not exist technology for recovering the high-value materials that are in these
    wastes. The proposed project intends to develop a new approach using chemical
    techniques as opposed to simple melt recycling to enable the value-added recycling
    of high value polymers from such wastes. Chemical process development will take
    place in order to take the current status of the technology to implementation
    in a pilot plant. The main technical objective of the proposal is to develop the
    process so as to produce large amounts of consistent, high purity product. Materials
    such as polyester and nylon cannot be separated from natural or cellulosic fibers
    such as cotton or other textile materials. The goals of the research are to develop
    the proposers' current process for fractionating the synthetic resins with an
    emphasis on achieving high purity products at larger volumes. To this end, various
    chemistry and chemical engineering techniques will be investigated for exclusion
    of impurities from end product polymer at the kg scale.\n\nThis award reflects
    NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
    using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes development of berry post-picking screening and handling that will provide a safe and efficient way to remove contaminated berries from the processing stream of an automated harvester. The project will advance machine vision technology for robotic harvesting and will be a key enabling technology leading to acceptance of automated harvesting as safe and effective. The market sector addressed by this project is strawberry farmers, though the technology will be applicable to other types of fruit and vegetable farming as well. The automated harvesting technology advanced by this project will alleviate chronic and worsening labor shortages faced by strawberry farmers and will ensure that strawberries remain affordable and available to consumers. Filling the need created by farming labor shortages is a $1 billion business opportunity.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop new vision processing and inspection methods vital to enabling use of an automated, robotic strawberry harvester. Acceptance of automated harvesting technology by strawberry farmers hinges on the ability of the harvester to remove bad berries from the plant without allowing the undesirable berries from entering the harvester packaging stream and potentially contaminating large quantities of berries. To achieve this, it will be necessary for the harvester to identify and eliminate diseased, rotten, damaged, or infested berries at multiple stages in the stream from automated picking to final packaging. The classification method that identifies the berries to be eliminated will be extremely accurate, with a very high detection rate and a low false alarm rate. The methods developed will be suitable for installation on a farming machine that is subject to a harsh outdoor environment as well as the shock and vibration environment found on a robotic harvesting device. New handling processes will be developed that will allow automated inspection of the entire berry without damaging the fruit or creating a risk of cross contamination from infected berries, significantly advancing the state of the art for automated strawberry processing.

    This STTR Phase II project supports standards-based math education in elementary school classrooms with a hands-on technology intervention. Research has shown that many elementary teachers suffer from low confidence and limited subject content knowledge in math and struggle to develop instruction designed to meet or exceed common core math learning goals. Teachers and researchers alike seek new approaches to engage students and improve teacher effectiveness to improve learning outcomes. The primary goal of this project is the development of a flexible, user-friendly, hands-on robotics kit with associated curriculum and support for teachers, that will engage students in learning math content, align with core curriculum, and measurably increase student achievement. The commercialization of this research-based classroom kit will enable school districts to adopt active learning into their math pedagogy. Ultimately, this promotes the NSF mission to increase national prosperity through science innovation by improving math preparation for students across the United States and preparing them to participate in careers that drive the advancement of science and technology.


    The core contribution of this work is composed of a flexible hardware kit to enable active learning within the core elementary curriculum as well as more traditional maker activities, and a suite of apps that allow students to use this kit to learn specific math content while also providing options to learn computational thinking through general purpose programming apps. To accomplish this, the team employs a proven design process in which hardware, software, and curriculum are simultaneously designed to align to learner goals, evaluated in classroom studies, and iteratively refined. The kit will combine the ease of use and simplicity of a regular snap-together style electronics kit with the flexibility of a programmable microcontroller. The apps developed for this project will build on a new math-based paradigm for robot programming. These math-oriented apps will remove the barrier of programming skills for elementary teachers and students alike when using the electronics kit for math instruction. Simultaneously, programming apps will enable open-ended explorations of making and computational thinking. Another contribution of this project will be the testing and analysis of the hardware system and complementary math curricula. Formative evaluation will enable exploration and understanding of novel mechanisms for learning math, and evaluation of the program's efficacy will enable characterization of the impact on student outcomes in math achievement and attitudes towards math.

    This SBIR Phase II project aims to develop and commercialize a transparent, thin multifunctional coating for corrosion and biofouling prevention on coated surface. Its environmentally friendly product will be an efficient ready-to-use single component product that can be applied with ease, and would dry in ambient conditions without the need for external heating equipment. The global annual expenditure to mitigate corrosion is in the range of $2.5 trillion, roughly equal to 3.4% of the world's GDP. Protecting assets from corrosion is, hence, a critical requirement for all the industries. A broad range of applications can benefit from this coating technology such as aviation industry where removal of toxic chromium compounds from coating procedures is of high priority, automobile manufacturing where extended corrosion protection to vehicles without using toxic treatments is constantly sought, structural engineering where providing long life protection to bridges is always needed, marine engineering where protecting ships from corrosion and not contributing to ecological imbalance is long sought, military where minimizing the maintenance downtime of tanks and guns is of prime importance, hospitals that are interested in longer lasting medical implants, and paints and coating industry that is desiring removal of volatile organic components from their paints and coatings. The proposed coating is expected to offer scratch resistance and oleophobic characteristics in addition to corrosion protection. The initial success of this project will result in two high-volume products.


    This project aims to develop a specialized single-part, ready-to-use, nominally bioceramic liquid coating for protection against corrosion and fouling activities. On application over desired surface, this transparent liquid transforms into hard-yet-flexible coating. This thin coating composition consists of in-place generated nanoparticles of organometallic compounds in the 3D network of polysilsesquioxane. The reactivity of the precursor to coating is designed such that material can react with substrates in ambient conditions and dries to solid film without the need of any external heating. The hardened coating adheres to most surfaces including metals, ceramics, plastics, glasses, and wood. The optimum thickness of coating is approximately ten microns and can impart various desired surface functionalities to the coated object. In this project, efforts are directed towards optimization of current composition to be compatible with broad range of commercially available topcoat materials. The optimized coating composition will be subjected to a rapid properties screening before third party testing, validation and approvals. An extensive field testing will be conducted in collaboration with potential customers. This innovative coating technology will initially result into two products that can be used in place of carcinogenic hexavalent chromium compounds that are currently in use for the corrosion protection of metals. While one of the products would act as a corrosion prevention compound that can adhere to commercial topcoat paints, the other would act as self-cleaning coating to prevent biofouling activities.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is a video-based safety system for improving
    the quality and reducing the cost of dementia care. Alzheimer's Disease (AD) affects
    5.4M in the US, including 1 in 9 over 65 and 1 in 3 over 85, and represents two
    thirds of all those affected by dementia. It is the single most expensive disease
    in the US ($236B direct; $221B indirect costs). The size of the US population
    with AD doubles every 15 years. The drug failure rate for AD is among the highest,
    currently 99.6. Fall accidents account for 26% of all AD related hospitalizations
    and are a major concern and key cost contributor, with an average fall rate of
    4 falls per year and 3 in 4 repeated falls. Unfortunately, safety products developed
    for falls were developed for cognitively aware adults and not designed specifically
    for individuals with AD. The proposed system will change the quality of care and
    operations in memory care facilities, increase quality of life for patients and
    families, and help the medical profession gain a better understanding of dementia.
    \n\n\nThe proposed project addresses this critical gap in Alzheimer's care by
    detecting safety critical events, based on camera video where events can be reviewed
    by a human assistant in real-time and after the fact. It is expected to achieve
    two main objectives that advance science and technology: (1) Demonstrating the
    ability for our machine learning algorithms to automatically perform safety critical
    tasks, by learning over a sufficiently rich set of data. These extend existing
    methods for fall detection to include (a) fall prediction; (b) wandering detection;
    (c) bed sores detections; (2) enabling the Company to demonstrate that the system
    proposed can run with a fully operational HIL paradigm running at scale with up
    to 1000 patients in 100 memory care facilities.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be that this research will address the resolution and detection range requirements of autonomous driving in complex environments such as urban scenarios. The next major revolution of transportation is undoubtedly autonomous driving, which will increase safety, mobility and productivity. Fully autonomous transportation may eliminate human error, the leading cause of traffic accidents, and could also lead to reduced traffic congestion, higher energy efficiency, and enhanced mobility for the aging and disabled population. The proposed advanced sensing system with intelligent algorithms is expected to help enable and advance the autonomous driving revolution. The proposed effort will also have great commercial impact. The global market size of autonomous sensors is expected to grow from $5.2 billion in 2018 to $11.9 billion in 2023, with the radar-based sensor segment representing $2.9 billion in 2023. In addition, the expected research outcome may lead to advancements in a number of important market sectors including wireless communications, sensing, mobile internet, assistive technology, and additive manufacturing.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project aims to realize a 3D-printed Luneburg lens-based high performance automotive radar for autonomous driving. Existing automotive radars do not have enough distance detection, field of view, and angular resolution for classifying and locating dense targets, which is critical for achieving fully autonomous driving. As a result, current autonomous driving tests utilize LiDAR ((Light Detection And Ranging) systems which are more expensive and less reliable than radar especially under adverse weather conditions such as rain, snow, fog, and smoke. Compared to conventional manufacturing techniques, this project utilizes 3D printing, which is convenient, fast, inexpensive and capable of implementing millimeter wave Luneburg lenses. Based on the Luneburg lens?s ability to form multiple beams with high gain and broad bandwidth, a novel automotive radar will be designed by mounting radar detectors around the lens. Moreover, with the wide bandwidth and natural beam forming capabilities of the Luneburg lens, an adaptive sensing approach is proposed to improve the scanning efficiency and avoid interference from nearby or intruder radar systems. With these proposed approaches, the objective is to achieve a high performance and high value millimeter-wave sensing system suitable for autonomous transportation applications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will usher new Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) products delivering high accuracy with explainability. Without rationale behind predictions, decision makers can't trust and effectively use AI/ML solutions.  Outcome of R&D through this project would lead to more accurate and faster detection with appropriate explanation of anomalous interactions and recommend effective controls to 1) eliminate billions of dollars of fraud, waste and abuse (FWA) in Health Insurance  markets;  2) lower costs, improve quality and speed of Health Care delivery to consumers; and 3) promote new markets in Personalized Health and Smart Health sector for  emerging Medical Internet-of-Things (IOT) devices and systems, enabling economic growth.  The results of this research are expected to enable the discovery of medical anomaly together with advancing the detection of new types of FWA. The boost in detection accuracy with explanation will save hundreds of millions of dollars. Societal impact includes reduced costs to consumers and taxpayers through better FWA control and advance health outcome through early medical IOT anomaly detection. More broadly, the system is expected to detect possible opioid or substance abuse epidemic cohorts, under/over-medication, advanced alerts for community health anomalies.

    The proposed project will extend and generalize a novel machine learning method to solve the Fraud, Waste, and Abuse (FWA) problem in health insurance, coupled with explanatory capability providing rational behind predictions and operationalized in a distributed parallel computing framework for scaling. The technical problem is how to combine relations between entities (e.g., doctors) with their attribute (e.g., a doctor's prescription history). This project advances the state of the art by combining relations between rows in the training data (e.g. doctors) with standard machine learning to improve prediction accuracy while facilitating local explanation. The result is vastly improved prediction accuracy with explainability. Thus, the method uses network information to fill in the gaps of entity information alone and vice versa while facilitating explanation for a test case. This method is expected to significantly improve the ability to detect FWA and pave ways for multi Billion dollars savings, call out IOT-based medical anomaly in advance to improve health outcome and build trust in the predictions for the decision makers through the explanations provided. The team intends to deliver not only the accuracy boost with explainability, but a fully operational system with automated data pipeline, parallel and distributed algorithmic processing framework which can be deployed on a SaaS basis or an enterprise solution.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on using analytics and technology to benefit patients who require additional care to fully recover - or simply to maintain their health - after being discharged from the hospital. Whether subacute or community-based care, significant opportunity exists to leverage machine learning, decision science, and advance data mining techniques to better support patients. State and federal budgets cover the costs of care for millions of Americans every year. This expenditure is growing faster than inflation, prompting the development of both optional and mandatory payment reform efforts that stand to simultaneously reduce costs and improve care outcomes. If successful, this project will help reduce costs of care for healthcare providers, payers, and government/society.

    The proposed project aims to incorporate and improve upon user-centered decision science in healthcare. The proposed platform will combine advanced machine learning techniques with a patient/family-centered business model. The innovation will harness multiple streams of healthcare data, such as claims/billing data from acute, subacute, and community care settings. If successful, this research will impact the state-of-the-art in healthcare analytics and outcomes measurement.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will continually refine and move towards production of this project's Creative Maker Tool, an augmented reality experience where the act of playing is inherently inventing. The system uses modern technology to avoid digital screens. Throughout this experience, learners tap into their natural proclivities to make and shape ideas in the non-digital world, and develop the ability to fluently construct new ideas in a technical medium. The commercialization of this project will address two, nationally important issues. First, by scaffolding young learners through progressively bringing their ideas into reality, this project will foster creative confidence: the natural ability to come up with ideas and the courage to act on them. Next, there is a gender gap in innovation and entrepreneurship in the United States. Women patent at 40% the rate of men, only 9% of information technology related patents have one or more female inventors, and only 8% of the beneficiaries of incubators meant to commercialize innovations were women. This project will address gender equity issues in the maker community (currently 80% male) and by widening pathways to engage in making.


    The system is composed of a projection system that allows real-time programmable interactions between everyday and virtual objects without a computer screen. Throughout this research, we will create and refine STEM (Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics) Apps, which are built-in augmented activities where users create small inventions with everyday objects to code interactions and affect program flow or gameplay, develop Augmented Tutorials, bridge seamlessly to existing STEM tools through real-time interfacing, as well as manufacture and prepare the system.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is that if successful, the results of this project will revolutionize large area LED array assembly manufacturing, leading to unprecedented growth of the direct view LED display market. Direct view LED displays, or video walls, are becoming more ubiquitous in everyday life. First only appearing in sports stadiums, they have gradually started appearing in retail advertising, and now are starting to appear in cinemas and control rooms. These types of displays are much brighter, have better contrast ratios, faster refresh rates, and are more energy efficient than other competing display technologies. Despite these advantages, rate of adoption is very slow, limited by the cost and time required to make these displays. Current manufacturing tools are facing a bottleneck as display resolutions increase. A massively parallel assembly technology could drastically increase production speeds while reducing cost-of-goods. Additionally, the knowledge gained by the research into this self-assembly technology has the potential to unlock new opportunities in semiconductor packaging including lighting and concentrated solar.

    The proposed project seeks to speed-up the LED placement process by leveraging the parallel nature of directed self-assembly. Rather than placing individual LEDs into a grid-array as it is done today, this technology utilizes confining magnetic fields to quickly and simply arrange hundreds or thousands of LEDs into a neat and ordered grid-array. The objective is to achieve assembly speeds at least 5 times faster than conventional tools. The research will focus on the effects of LED size and geometry on accuracy, rate, and yield. Additionally,  new magnetic field stages to enhance assembly precision will be developed. The key anticipated results are (1) a system that will be able to rapidly assemble thousands of LED die with the precision necessary for high-resolution displays and (2) a fully operational LED display panel constructed with this technology to demonstrate the manufacturing potential of this technology.

    This SBIR Phase II Project aims to tackle the two greatest barriers to technology adoption associated with metal additive manufacturing (AM) - cost and quantities. Current metal AM platforms use expensive core components and consumable materials in high-priced machines that produce 99.9% dense parts. The proposed project calls into question the performance requirements that most American manufacturers have for industrial grade stainless steel parts. While these manufacturers require high performance, they cannot currently afford to take advantage of AM benefits due to the high capital expenditure, maintenance, and operating costs associated with current commercial technologies. This proposal re-examines the material performance, machine cost and reliability requirements necessary for a novel metal AM system to satisfy most American manufacturers' needs. In developing a low-cost AM alternative, the goal of the proposal is to allow an estimated over 50,000 American manufacturers to capitalize on the benefits of AM and simultaneously compete in an ultra-competitive, highly globalized manufacturing industry. In addition, procurement for low to medium volume order quantities (1000 - 20,000 pieces) is incredibly challenging with respect to high cost and long lead times. The proposed invention of a low-cost machine allows for never seen scalability in metal AM, allowing for smaller manufacturers to scale by taking advantage of meaningful order quantities and compete with the resources of large conglomerates. This research has broad implications in many industries and could be fundamentally enabling for the growth and prosperity of American manufacturing.


    The proposed project re-examines the need for high technology, high cost core components in currently available commercial metallic AM machines. Through an innovative deconstruction of the inkjet print head-based, binder jetting process, a method for producing metal end-use parts has been created. The 3DEO process is based on a novel combination of two low-tech and low cost, established technologies. The creation of a robust prototype with this novel method is a highly challenging, multi-faceted project involving key advances in materials science trough the development of a novel binder system compatible with the new process as well as a fundamental evaluation and improvement of material properties of the as-built parts. In addition, completely re-designed sintering cycles and a lengthy evaluation of shrinkage characteristics will be core challenges to overcome to achieve the tight tolerances manufacturing partners require. As such, these challenges will require tight cross-disciplinary collaboration for a meaningful outcome. The goal of the proposed research is to fabricate powder metallurgy parts of adequate structural integrity to satisfy industrial end-use requirements.

    This SBIR Phase II project will create an industrial process for bonding ceramics to metals at the molecular level. Attempts thus far have not been successful in creating robust bonds due to incongruities of the materials being bonded. The objective of this project is to develop a sophisticated, computer controlled, automated bonding machine that will rapidly and safely impact-bond net-shaped ceramic carbides to tool steel in configurations that were previously not available. An automated bonding machine will allow for a cost-effective way to rapidly produce high quality near-net or net-shaped parts. It is expected that as this simple method is popularized, new opportunities for design configurations will be realized in multiple industries; as single parts can take advantage of the properties multiple material, such as the strength and wear resistance of ceramics, with the properties of another, such as the light weight properties of aluminum. Engineers may incorporate cheaper, lighter, stronger, and multipurpose material parts into new product designs. For instance, many new ceramic and metal bonded parts may be fabricated for the automotive, aerospace, chemical, defense, excavation, and nuclear industries. This project will ultimately result in the creation of U.S. manufacturing, sales, and engineering jobs as the mass production of ceramic and metal bonded parts become commercially available.


    The impact-bonding occurs within a bonding machine and uses a portable and very powerful cartridge technology recently developed by the PI, an expert in aluminum/water reactions. The cartridges are initiated in an enclosed chamber with a low voltage, which causes the disassociation of water molecules and rapid oxidization of aluminum that generates very high-pressure hydrogen in a safe and controlled manner and without the use of high voltage, explosives or flammable gun propellants. Key technological subjects of this research include the impact-energy, generated hydrogen propulsion, and the post-bond impact-energy absorption. The goal is a manufacturing process that will produce dissimilar material composite parts with superior joint strength that will survive impact-fatigue-cycles in harsh environments such as mining, demolition, excavation, construction, oil gas drilling, and many more potential industries. Other mechanical methods of joining ceramics and metals, such as brazing and adhesives, have not sustained impact fatigue cycling. The superior products are wear resistant and will benefit several industries to include the cutting tool market, electrical and thermally insulated components, ballistic armor, and others. This project aims to produce pioneering publications on impact bonding ceramics and metals and will also further enhance the knowledge of high-velocity impact bonding systems.

    This SBIR Phase II effort will create transformative open tools to enable affordable access at scale to high quality assessments (problems & questions) for foundational subjects in secondary and post-secondary education. The explosion of online student audiences, rapid growth of Open Educational Resources (OER), and the need to support individual learners are creating an unprecedented demand for digital assessments. Assessment authoring tools today are controlled by large organizations, require advanced skills and proprietary assessment delivery platforms with restrictive collaboration features. This inequity is particularly pronounced with respect to technology-enabled assessments (TEAs) which are sophisticated, digital assessments that enable deeper learning. This effort will democratize the process of authoring and sharing TEAs through the creation of intuitive end user tools that will enable educators without advanced technical skills to author and share TEAs. This has the potential to disrupt the status quo by empowering educators to take charge of the assessment creation and distribution landscape with ground-breaking tools that enable easy authoring and distribution of sophisticated TEAs without being restricted by a proprietary assessment system. Eventually, this will empower educators at scale by triggering the evolution of a peer-to-peer marketplace around the need for assessments, and impact hundreds of thousands of learners in secondary and tertiary education settings.


    This project will follow through on two principal innovations. The first is an end-user tool that will dramatically reduce the time and expertise required to author technology-enhanced assessments. The tool will facilitate intuitive authoring of TEAs by using symbolic representation of programming constructs. The second innovation is a new standard for representation of technology-enhanced assessments that makes them usable in any delivery platform, thus making the assessments platform-neutral. This effort will also advance the frontiers of authoring beyond individual assessments to the creation of adaptive assessment pathways that will provide personalization for diverse learners. It will explore novel technologies including the representation of TEAs as intelligent and portable objects that are interoperable with disparate assessment platforms through application programming interfaces. The research studies will provide insight into how the proposed innovations can make authoring of TEAs more efficient while lowering the skills barrier for educators, and the degree to which such TEAs are effective in eliciting student reasoning and thinking processes in foundational subjects. This will be achieved through a combination of usability and validation studies in partnership with secondary and post-secondary educators drawn from different institutions.

    Transfer (STTR) will be to develop a platform to accelerate the engineering of

    Cell-free systems can catalyze reactions without cellular complexity and without

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project are numerous and include commercial, societal, environmental, and educational impacts. Commercially, an innovation of this magnitude would enable flexible design illumination, with great control over light placement, beam shape, stray light, and light pollution, all while decreasing the size and complexity of the optics and fixtures required. This will impact the amount of electricity used for lighting, helping to reduce global energy consumption, preserve our environment, and create economic and societal benefits. This project will also result in the employment several technical personnel to carry out the project's technical goals. Educational outreach will continue to impact the local community, students and researchers at nearby institutions, as well as visitors through seminars and workshops on solid-state lighting, materials research, and entrepreneurship. Furthermore, the technical results may also inform future materials research in the development of robust materials, components, and device architectures with optimal properties to advance other areas of solid-state lighting research.

    The proposed project is aimed at achieving deployment of laser-stimulated phosphor technology for illumination in the commercial marketplace. Research in the field of solid-state lighting is advancing towards the goal of ultra-efficient and smart lighting. Exploring laser-stimulated phosphor emission could lead to next generation, energy-efficient light sources, surpassing the limitations of current lighting technologies. Optical modeling and thermal simulations will be used to optimize the optics, phosphor materials, and device architectures to achieve narrow-beam angle, low-etendue, and high color-quality white light sources, while maintaining efficient operating temperature. Secondary components will be designed, including the electronics, packaging, heat sinks; compatibility tested with fixtures and manufacturing processes; and implementation into a light engine compatible in design and functionality with customer-specific applications. Regulatory, safety, and performance testing will be completed to achieve industry-specific standards, by working with regulatory bodies to test lifetime and durability in operating conditions, implementation of safety mechanisms, and photometric testing to ensure performance metrics. Lastly, planning, partnerships, execution, data collection, and reporting of field trail testing of products in real life conditions will result in a fully deployed and tested product, ready for implementation.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop and commercialize MRA arrays for
    use in 802.11ac/ax WLAN systems and 5G mm-wave systems based on new radio specifications.
    5G systems require exploitation of massive multiple input multiple output (MIMO)
    technology with a large number of antennas to attain significantly improved spectral
    efficiency, thereby achieving required network capacities and enhanced connectivity.
    Massive MIMO is also needed to overcome severe propagation losses in mm-wave bands,
    where large swaths of spectrum is available. If a MIMO system uses legacy dumb
    antennas with fixed properties, the resulting complexity and cost figures, and
    the power consumption associated with a large number of RF front ends render them
    commercially prohibitive. The MRA array technology delivers 3-10 dB higher array
    gain compared to legacy arrays. Such gains can be used to improve RF coverage,
    increase user throughput, and reduce network costs by lowering the number of RF
    nodes or reduce the cost, size and power consumption of access point equipment
    by lowering the number of antenna elements. This project will deliver the beta
    prototypes of two MRA array modules containing the hardware and control algorithm
    that can be seamlessly integrated with WLAN and 5G small-cell modems.\n\nThis

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will research and develop new functional materials for advanced additive manufacturing. The goal of this project is to develop high performance materials for light activated 3D printers. If successful, this will enable new tools for manufacturing and research. Applications of this project would enable affordable, waste-free, and energy-efficient manufacturing with the goal of lowering barriers to innovation. Specifically, this project has the potential to improve the quality of healthcare around the world, by dramatically lowering the costs of designing and manufacturing biomedical devices.

    polySpectra has developed a new class of modular 3D printing resins, capable of manufacturing production-quality parts with tailored geometry and chemical functionality in a single step. This process is called ?functional lithography,? and it unlocks the ability to simultaneously define the form and function of advanced materials. The application of functional lithography to additive manufacturing enables production-ready parts to be directly 3D-printed, whereas existing materials can only make prototypes, mock-ups or toys.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to develop low-power, low-cost and small
    form factor wireless connectivity solutions, facilitating the deployment of inexpensive and long-lived
    wireless sensors and devices for a diverse set of applications. For instance, it is infeasible to place
    conventional sensors or wireless connectivity on low-cost or disposable items due to the high cost and
    short battery life of wireless communication devices. With the successful completion of this project,
    items ranging from consumer packaged goods to medical consumables and pill bottles could be

    which more closely fit their needs. By enabling new use cases for wireless connectivity, this technology
    can prompt innovation across many industries.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project introduces a new long-range
    backscatter-based communication technology based on Chirp Spread Spectrum, a wireless protocol
    which can be detected at extremely low signal levels. The low-power wireless system prior to this
    project is comprised of three elements: A passive backscatter-based radio, a first gateway device which
    provides an illumination signal, and a second gateway device which receives the resulting
    backscattered data and forwards data to the Internet. In this project, the passive backscatter-based
    radio will be implemented in an integrated circuit form, realizing the low power and low cost possible
    with this technology. The two gateway devices will be combined into one full-duplex radio device, to
    address the needs of the majority of deployment scenarios. Techniques to localize the backscatter
    radios within the field of the gateway device will be explored. Finally, security challenges will be
    addressed and the system will undergo extensive evaluation and testing.

    Transfer (STTR) Phase II project will focus on the design of the first completely
    automated radio frequency ablation (RFA) system for breast tissue. Of the  approximately
    200,000 breast cancer patients in the US who elect lumpectomy annually, over 20%
    must undergo re-operation due to lack of clear margins. Furthermore, many breast
    cancer patients who are treated with lumpectomy require expensive adjuvant radiation
    therapy that can last up to 7 weeks causing time away from work and family. Fortunately,
    performing intraoperative RFA of the lumpectomy cavity has been shown to decrease
    the need for re-operations and radiation therapy by sterilizing tumor margins.
    However, no RFA devices are designed for post-lumpectomy breast cavities or breast
    tissue. The RFA system being developed in this project will automate post-lumpectomy
    RFA, accurately and precisely delivering energy based on local tissue properties
    and desired ablation depth in three dimensions thus customizing treatment for
    each patient. Eventual commercialization of this system could provide early stage
    breast cancer patients new treatment options that improve quality of life, reduce
    burdens of care, and costs while providing breast cancer recurrence control.   \n\nThe
    proposed project aims to develop a system (control unit and device) for optimal
    post-lumpectomy RFA. The proposed device is designed to mechanically fit the post-lumpectomy
    cavity for near-perfect tissue contact. The control unit includes advanced algorithms
    that utilize machine learning to create a three-dimensional ablation status map
    of each margin (ablation vs in-ablated) for controlling ablation. The combined
    system allows the surgeon to customize and monitor the three-dimensional ablation
    profile and automates therapy delivery to ensure accurate, precise ablation results.
    The objectives propose gathering device requirements, identifying critical tasks
    of an automated RFA procedure, and improving the system algorithm by collecting
    training data in cadaveric and prophylactic mastectomy specimens. The intellectual
    merits proposed are: (1) an automated ablation system implemented on an embedded
    microprocessor and co?]processor FPGA capable of ablation shape estimation and

- abstractText: "The broader impact and commercial potential of this Small Business
    Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to treat chronic back and lower
    limb pain more effectively using a high-resolution stimulation technology.  Lower
    back pain affects more than 100M Americans.  While spinal cord neuro-modulation
    is successful for about 60% of patients, many people remain untreated and suffer
    from chronic pain.  Low-back pain is the most difficult to treat due as conventional
    electrode technology cannot selectively deliver energy to these fibers due to
    the bulky paddle electrode volume associated with the legacy manufacturing processes.
    \ Furthermore, to achieve maximal pain relief, neurosurgeons must wake the subjects
    during an operation to verify if the patient senses pain relief as the electrode
    is positioned.  Many subjects undergo multiple operations due to inaccurate electrode
    alignment or movement of the electrode over time due to physical activity.  The
    proposed active grid electrode technology seeks to double the size of therapeutic
    surface area, including providing therapy to low-back fibers which are not accessible
    by conventional electrodes.  The technology is expected to improve low-back pain
    relief, as well as use wireless programming to alter the therapy in the event
    of electrode movement, avoiding the need for re-operation.  \n\nThe proposed project
    seeks to double the area of the spinal cord which can receive therapeutic benefit,
    by developing an active stimulation-grid electrode grid technology.  By positioning
    a very small electronic circuit within the paddle electrode, the team is expected
    to create a 64 contact therapy array to deliver precision therapy.   To accomplish
    these goals, the project includes three critical tasks including:  (1) develop
    a medical-grade design of the implantable electronics, package, and lead array,
    (2) perform mechanical aging and stretch testing, and (3) prepare prototypes for
    subsequent ISO 14708 validation testing.  The goal of the project is to accelerate
    the medical-grade hardware development effort to enable future therapies to treat
    low-back pain.  Eventual validation after this project is completed will be performed
    in humans by selectively applying stimulation and recording if the patient feels
    therapy in the low-back area."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project on hospital service robots is improving the quality of care in hospital systems that are under increased pressure to provide high-quality patient-centric care while functioning as profitable businesses. Hospitals face a shortage of qualified nurses and high rates of nurse turnover. Nurses play a critical role in communicating care plans, educating patients, and guarding against medical errors. The amount of time they spend in direct care activities is a key determinant of patient satisfaction, better patient outcomes, fewer errors, and shorter lengths of stay. In the face of nursing shortages across the U.S., it is increasingly important to have nurses performing at the 'top of their license'. Reducing the amount of time they spend on non-nursing tasks is crucial to this goal. Automation could address these challenges and labor shortage by allowing clinical staff to focus on providing skilled care. The proposed project aims to develop technology that is general-purpose enough to transfer to other markets, such as long term care facilities and, eventually, individual consumers. Robots that perform assistive tasks in homes could increase the feasibility of independent living for many older adults.


    The proposed project will establish the technical and commercial feasibility of developing hospital service robots that act as assistants on acute care units, enabling nurses to spend more time at the bedside with patients. This project will make technical advances along three dimensions: the ability of the proposed robot to autonomously navigate within nursing units and across the hospital (navigation capabilities); to easily adapt its manipulation skills to specific tasks and to physical characteristics of a particular hospital/unit (adaptive learning of manipulation skills); and to work alongside humans in a socially acceptable manner, including appropriate navigation in crowded hallways, speech, and eye gaze behaviors that communicate the robot's intentions (socially intelligent interoperability). The team intends to collaborate closely with a single partner hospital to iteratively improve the reliability and robustness of the artificial intelligence software suite developed with NSF funding and to deploy production-quality versions of the three core competencies. The final 6 months will involve a long-term deployment, with the robot autonomously working on an acute care unit of the partner hospital. The impact of the robot on unit staff and workflows will be documented, with the ultimate goal of developing a service robot that hospital staff view as a competent member of the care team.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to enable and support the future development, approval, and clinical use of new therapeutics the cure HIV-1 infection.  HIV-1 infection can be controlled by available antiretroviral therapy, but cannot be cured due to the persistence of the virus in a quiescent, or latent state.  This latent HIV-1 is the barrier to curing infection.  While latent HIV-1 can be found in all infected individuals, it is present in very low frequencies.  To cure HIV-1 infection, new therapeutics that eliminate latent HIV-1 must be developed.  This development is hindered by current lack of a sensitive, accurate, and scalable test to measure latent HIV-1 in infected individuals.

    The proposed project seeks to develop and optimize a sensitive, accurate, and scalable test to measure latent HIV-1 in the blood of infected individuals.  Current tests used in research laboratories to measure latent HIV-1 are either non-specific or require large volumes of blood and many days to complete.  This project is focused on developing a new molecular test that specifically measures latent HIV-1 from a minimal volume of blood in hours.  Specifically, the project is focused on defining initial test performance and developing critical assay controls needed for robust performance of this new molecular test for latent HIV-1.  Successful completion of this project will yield a latent HIV-1 test prototype that can be advanced to market to support research and early-stage clinical trials.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is the development of a user-friendly asthma management solution. The asthma management tool consists of a portable medical device and mobile app combination that measures lung function with the consistency and accuracy of a trained lab technician, displaying current asthma status, and providing health insights to act upon. During the 2-year duration of this proposal, the applicant will further develop a machine-learning algorithm that obtains the same level of consistency and accuracy as if a trained lab technician were coaching and correcting the asthmatic patient on proper usage. Steps will be taken to establish the efficacy of such technology through verification of classification by pulmonologists. In order to engage users to continue using the product over several months, gamification elements will be implemented into the mobile app. By expanding on the machine-model through a longitudinal study, earlier detection of asthma exacerbations may be identified. Early detection leads to improved self-management as measured by the reduction of severe asthma attacks, the use of systemic corticosteroids, hospitalizations, emergency department or urgent care visits related to asthma.

    The proposed project aims to develop an asthma management tool that provides parents a simple way to reliably monitor their child's lung health, eliminating the guesswork associated with relying on symptoms alone. The rate of asthma continues to rise, with an increasing amount of healthcare utilization among asthmatic individuals. Effective technologies for proper management remain trapped within the hospital due to high costs and requirement of a skilled lab technician for proper measurement collection. This proposal aims to develop an algorithm alongside UCSF pediatric pulmonologists to gain consistent and accurate spirometry measurements, so that only proper measurements are acted upon. Our machine-learning algorithm will determine the cause of failure and prompt the user on corrective action to achieve a good quality measurement on a subsequent effort. By the end of this proposal period, the applicant will have a mobile app algorithm that is able to achieve the consistency of a trained lab technician, provide effective corrective feedback, engage users over the span of months for consistent lung monitoring, and potentially predict the onset of an asthma attack.

    This SBIR Phase II project should increase the adoption of pedagogically validated educational games that facilitate retention and effective use of business concepts taught and relevant to managing organizations. Start-ups, for-profit and nonprofit companies all need managers who can make effective decisions in the face of complexity and uncertainty. It is of the utmost importance to society, therefore, that the next generation of business leaders is equipped with relevant frameworks and tools that supplement traditional teaching methods and enable effective use of knowledge on the job. Hence, this project has the potential to empower the U.S. workforce to be more productive and innovative, which will improve existing business outcomes and thus drive U.S. job and economic growth. Improved business operations will also lead to more profitable business in general and potentially larger tax revenues for the U.S. government. Eventually opening the GDL to third-party authors in the $18.6 billion global game-based learning market will accelerate game innovation and usage in other business and engineering disciplines at a lower cost, which will both enhance the effectiveness of the STEM workforce and encourage more economic activity in the game development market.

    This project is based on three innovations that differentiate this solution from others: (1) a scientific Game Research and Development (GR&D) process designs games containing pedagogical learning objectives; (2) a Game Design Language (GDL) accelerates implementation of game concepts as automatically validated, domain specific language while eliminating runtime errors; and (3) an innovative web Game Distribution Platform (GDP) minimizes the effort to setup and manage games in the classroom. Typical educational game development in languages such as JavaScript is time-consuming, involves professional software engineers and requires debugging of runtime errors, while usage of game technology in the class is disruptive to the flow of instruction. Such challenges are therefore prohibitive for non-professional programmers and game administrators such as professors. To mitigate the problem of runtime errors, this project employs methods of video game development, which typically use domain-specific languages based on non-Turing-complete models of computation to solve these issues. Games created with GDL will enable rapid new game development and have a guaranteed level of technical quality, allowing professors to focus on pedagogical relevance during instruction. The main technical hurdle is to tailor these methods to result in GDL capable of expressing the Operations Management (OM) games conceived during the scientific GR&D process and playable via the GDP that enables seamless class integration.

    This SBIR Phase II project continues previous development of an invention disclosure tool that allows users to draft a United States Patent and Trademark Office compliant patent applications by using an intuitive interface and game-based educational tools to draft patent applications. Inventors and small companies having no background in patent law and patent-application drafting strategies struggle with properly describing their inventions.  Overcoming this lack of understanding on the part of the inventor requires a great deal of one-on-one educational training with a patent professional in order to draft a quality patent application. However, engaging a patent professional is costly and time consuming. This project expands the capacity of the invention disclosure software by allowing users to configure and customize the software for specific types of inventions and arts.

    Specifically, this project proposes a new customization tool for integration with the existing invention disclosure tool to allow for widespread adoption into varied technology arts. The customization tool comprises software modules that allow end users to identify and create narrative goals, design software interfaces by configuring display rules, design text output state configurations based on logical operators, design natural language output, design the natural language generated output that is desired for that product type and configure template text, token input, and grammar associations, and determine the position of natural language output into an overall document structure. This customization tool will allow for rapid, scalable distribution of the product to be driven by end users rather than through a traditional software development process, e.g., 1) researching, 2) market testing, and 3) designing and implementing each new version of a product for different technology arts.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project lies in the development of a novel cost-effective 3D printing process to manufacture footwear. Currently most footwear is mass manufactured, typically overseas, using fixed molds that do not meet the specific needs of an individual. 3D printing of footwear offers the promise of providing individual customization tailored not just to fit, style, and colors, but also to individual biomechanics and/or medical needs. However, a number of technical challenges exist to make 3D printing of footwear sufficiently cost-effective that it can be provided beyond just a select few individuals. This project develops a novel and cost-effective 3D printing process to manufacture the critical components of footwear, using readily available and recyclable thermoplastic pellets. This novel 3D printing process will enable the manufacture of new, innovative footwear designs that cannot be made with any other manufacturing process. Additionally, it will make mass customization of footwear a reality, providing access to healthy customizable footwear for many individuals. Unlike traditional manufacturing processes currently being done overseas, this novel manufacturing technology is very amenable to implementing in the United States on a local level. Thus, this project will not only help move footwear manufacturing back to the United States, generating income for tax revenue, it will create entirely new clean, safe jobs in manufacturing.


    This project, led by a woman physician-scientist with a unique combination of expertise in both biomechanics and manufacturing, develops a novel and cost-effective 3D printing technology to print a proprietary mix of elastomeric material into a novel sole design that was developed on the basis of over twenty years of biomechanics research. The primary innovation that is being developed in this project is a specialized plasticizing screw-based extruder mounted on a 3D printer, specifically designed to make footwear, that uniquely and reliably extrudes a recyclable, thermo-elastomeric material that is most suitable for footwear, from its most cost-effective raw form: pellets. This project also develops a novel healthy and customizable sole design, based on the principal investigator's biomechanical research, which can only be made with this manufacturing technology innovation. Finally, this project develops a biomechanically research-based algorithm for customizing footwear made with this technology based on an individual's specific biomechanical profile and/or specific medical need. This project will allow for a novel, cost-effective manufacturing process where a bank of 3D printers operate simultaneously, each producing their own made-to-order pair of footwear and/or footwear components customized not only to fit but to an individual's specific biomechanical profile and/or medical need.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to demonstrate the feasibility of Battery Resourcers recycling process on a scale that has commercial significance. This will further allow Battery Resourcers to scale its process such that it can be a player in the lithium ion battery recycling market place. Battery Resourcers' ultimate goal is into increase recycling rates of spent Li-ion batteries by providing an economically viable domestic recycling option.  Additionally, Battery Resourcers process produces low cost cathode materials for the battery industry which may ultimately further enable green technologies like solar, wind and electric vehicles.

    This SBIR Phase 1 award proposes to scale the Battery Resourcers recycling process from 50kg to 0.5 tons of spent Li-ion batteries. The proposed research focuses on process speed, safety and the quality of the recovered materials. Rate limiting steps in Battery Resourcers recycling process will be studied with an effort to improve process speed. Specifically, Battery Resourcers will look at new filtering methods for the solutions generated in its process. A method to safety shred Li-ion batteries is examined by controlling the atmosphere and removing the batteries' stored energy. Finally, the production of quality cathode materials from spent Li-ion batteries is scaled from 50kg to 0.5 tons.  Battery Resourcers' goal is to produce commercial quality cathode powder on a scale that matters to industry.

    research into the US math crisis and the complexity of the problem. As a nation,
    we must invest resources directly into the breaking point: the mid school math
    cliff. The US shows the greatest decline worldwide from 4th to 10th grade on International
    tests in math. This project is designed to address all 146 Common Core State Standards
    (and all other state math standards) from 5th to 8th grade, providing a virtual
    reality context for each standard, embedded in an engaging, interactive 3-Act
    math story problem. The theoretical foundation of the project stems from Productive
    Failure, the concept that students perform better when they encounter productive
    failure prior to direct instruction in contrast to the reverse, where instruction
    is given first. Additionally, each simulator directly links student input to functional
    output to show how the math works, specifically allowing students to persist in
    exploring solutions. This project supports the NSF mission to support education
    for all fields fundamental to science and engineering, and holds the potential
    to positively impact a critical problem in U.S. education through broad commercial
    acceptance in schools throughout the US. \n\nThis project is designed to provide
    simulations in a virtual reality context for all standards from 5th to 8th grade,
    using a core software platform for delivery that can be ubiquitously used in classrooms
    throughout the United States. This high-risk technical innovation uniquely embeds
    math content in such a way that input leads to functional output such that students
    can see how the math actually works. Students watch the outcomes of their solutions,
    both the successes and the failures so they can try again. Math problems have
    context and meaning. Students experience the direct results of their mathematical
    abilities, while teachers have the ability to deploy specific problems and receive
    real-time metrics to further respond and support student comprehension. Underlying
    the advanced classroom technology is the pedagogical framework based on Productive
    Failure and the intentional withholding of instruction and information prior to
    direct experience with grappling with a difficult problem with trial and error
    repetition. The goal of the research is to illustrate that math simulations show
    the highest achievement in comparison to other methodologies and that Productive
    Failure is a viable tenant of learning that can be applied to all fields supporting
    higher math applications and scientific discovery."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be in development of Ultrasonic Nanocoining - a new platform technology that is used to generate plastic films or glass panels that are anti-reflective, self-cleaning, or colored through structure. Such nano-structured surfaces can provide benefits for a wide array of commercial applications, ranging from consumer electronics to automotive and aerospace. These surfaces can save energy by preventing internal reflections in OLED displays and cover-glass reflections on the surface of solar panels. What?s more, these surfaces enable better use of available space by adding functionality to surfaces without adding any appreciable volume. Nanocoining is a low-temperature, chemical-free process that does not rely on chemical etching or nano-particles, which have recently come under scrutiny from the EPA because of unknown health and environment effects. The science contained within the project spans several disciplines, and Nanocoining would ultimately contribute to low-cost, scalable manufacturing for a wide array of industries.


    Ultrasonic Nanocoining enables low-cost, high volume reproduction of surface textures comprised of nano-structures that are smaller than the wavelength of visible light. This is done by creating a cylindrical mold with a nano-structured surface, then imprinting that mold into plastics using roll-to-roll processing. The objectives of the current project are to use Nanocoining to indent billions of sub-wavelength features into both flat and cylindrical Nickel-plated molds in a continuous pattern, then use these molds to replicate the structure into a variety of polymer materials using roll-to-roll processing. The research will study each step of the mold fabrication process, including focused ion beam machining of the diamond die, controlling a dual-mode ultrasonic resonant actuator and registering millions of indents side-by-side without leaving a significant seam between them. Replicated film surfaces will be tested for optical and wetting properties, and the final result will be functionalized transparent film samples that prove commercial potential. In the future the process may be used to create meter-scale nano-structured metal molds for production-scale imprinting.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to revolutionize the efficiency of electric motors in the heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) market. The innovation technology area is a new class of electric motor and control hardware and software that is based on switched reluctance technology, exhibiting very high efficiencies of 90%+ across a broad range of speeds. This innovation will enhance scientific understanding by showing how this new class of electric motors can be optimized to minimize noise and vibration, while allowing variable speed control and Internet connectivity. The potential societal impacts of such a technology are significant: more than half the new motors purchased each year in the United States are 1-5 horsepower motors (1.024M of 1.792M), and they collectively account for nearly 25% of the United States electricity consumption. As such, if commercialized this technology could save retail and commercial organizations millions of dollars a year in electricity savings due to efficiency improvements. The benefits for an adoption rate of just 5% of available applications are $500M / year in electricity savings and 1M tons / year of carbon savings.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project aims to research a new type of electric motor with a high rotor pole switched reluctance (HRSRM) design. This HRSRM motor has a simplified physical construction with no permanent magnets but complex electronics that manage the torque and speed in the motor through carefully timed generation of magnetic fields. This class of motors have proven extremely difficult to research because of highly nonlinear response characteristics, and sensitivity to very small changes in timing, electromagnetics, and physical setup. This project will research methods for adapting dynamic control algorithms to increase the speed and sensitivity of the power electronics to manage these characteristics. Research will also examine physical elements of the design and build a generalized simulation model combining both finite element analysis as well as structural modeling, constrained mode analysis and vibration models to reduce and optimize noise, vibration and harshness measures. Finally this project will optimize the ~600 key parameters associated with an HRSRM motor, allowing the rapid design and prototyping of new motor designs in minutes rather than months.

    injury is compounded by risk factors, such as obesity, which limit the surgeon's
    ability to visualize and navigate vasculature. Therefore, there is a critical
    need to identify and assess hidden vasculature in real time. The proposed technology
    helps identify blood vessel before a cut is made. Importantly, this system will
    be designed for seamless integration into a suite of surgical instruments for
    multiple applications. Long term, the company will provide surgeons with the preeminent
    imaging platform to view, assess, and characterize a range of vessels (i.e. arteries/veins,
    ureters and bile ducts) in real-time for improved surgical guidance and outcomes.
    \n\nThe proposed project will develop a novel blood vessel detection and visualization
    platform using low-cost optical imaging sensors and light-emitting diodes (LEDs).
    The proposed technology will provide visual and quantitative information about
    vessel presence and size in real-time that can supplement a surgeon's technique.
    This system will be simple, cost-effective, easy to employ, and highly accurate.
    Traditionally, the avoidance of blood vessels during minimally invasive surgery
    is accomplished by visualization or costly intraoperative imaging. The proposed
    technology will use pulsatile light absorption characteristics of blood vessels
    to provide quantitative information about vessel presence and size in real-time,
    supplementing a surgeon's technique. This project will also add significant value
    to the body of research conducted in the areas of signal processing and image
    analysis. In addition, the proposed technology will remove the risk of data loss
    due to artifacts in general and motion artifacts in particular. The proposed technology
    will be validated ex vivo and in vivo using a porcine animal model."

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project has the objective of demonstrating that discrete, belt mounted internet-connected wearable devices used by industrial workers can detect high risk lifting activities, promote safe lifting practices and behavior change, and predict the risk of musculoskeletal injuries due to unsafe lifting. Each year over 600,000 workers suffer a musculoskeletal injury due to lifting related activities, which cost US companies over $15bn annually. Worker injuries affect employee morale, absenteeism, productivity loss and employee turnover, all of which are challenges to the efficient running of a company and are a unnecessary cause of human suffering. By developing a wearable device that can detect high risk lifting activity and provide immediate feedback to workers, safer lifting practices can be promoted and a reduction in the number of unsafe lifts registered, leading to a reduction in injuries.

    The project includes three main technical objectives: i) the development of machine learning algorithms to detect lifting events from sensor data, and to measure risk related metrics associated to those lifting events. When a lift is considered high risk, real-time feedback will be provided to the worker; ii) the deployment of the device in an industrial setting at several customer sites for 12 months, with the number of high risk lifts performed by workers quantified over time to measure the ability of the system to drive behavior change in the workforce; and ii) the development of a model that can predict the likelihood of musculoskeletal injures based on the risk metrics measured. It is expected that the outcomes of the project demonstrate a significant reduction in the risk of suffering musculoskeletal injuries, paving the way for a clear return on investment value proposition for the industrial companies and their insurance carriers who are potential customers.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to enable
    continuous sensing applications in a wide range of energy-constrained sensor-enabled
    devices. Without dramatic innovations in the development of ultralow power sensory
    processing, continuous and accurate sensing will remain a niche application limited
    to environments with a stable and plentiful power source and significant computing
    resources. The technology described in this proposal will demonstrate the viability
    and potential widespread deployment of continuous sensing devices in mobile or
    remote environments with strict energy constraints. An important immediate market
    for the proposed technology with significant customer base is the smartphone and
    wearables market, where many new and emerging end user applications could leverage
    environmental sensing to trigger context-based and anticipatory actions. The proposed
    technology is broadly applicable to a number of other markets and domains, including
    medical, health, and safety monitoring of critical patient sensors, personal fitness
    devices, military applications, and environmental monitors. The ability to flexibly
    deploy continuous sensing for these and other applications has the potential to
    revolutionize these markets and create entirely new and unforeseen application
    domains. \n\t\nThis Small Business Innovation Research Phase 2 Project plans to
    research and develop algorithms based on the properties of biological spiking
    neurons and the sensory processing capabilities of the human brain. The human
    brain is truly unique in its ability to use a basic computational element, the
    spiking neuron, and perform a broad variety of tasks. The brain has the ability
    to accurately classify sensory patterns from multiple modalities (touch, sight,
    etc.), to interpret the outside world, and to recognize the current context. A
    key intellectual merit of this project is a demonstration of how these novel neural
    algorithms can perform accurate, robust, and low power sensory analysis across
    multiple sensory domains. Just as the brain is capable of processing data from
    very different sensors. Researching and developing these neural algorithms will
    provide insight as to how the human brain learns to recognize important sensory
    information, how it is able to integrate information from such different sense
    modalities, and how it is able to perform complex analysis so efficiently."

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in the effort to bring our biomimetic rotor
    design to the marine hydrokinetic (MHK) market. MHK energy is a socially and environmentally
    friendly alternative to hydroelectric power, which harnesses energy from rivers,
    tides, ocean currents and manmade waterways without the use of a dam. This market
    is potentially large but still nascent due to high technology costs, concerns
    over turbine survivability, fish friendliness, and difficulty in permitting deployments.
    Our rotor's small, flexible configuration is a unique approach that addresses
    many MHK challenges with the mission of reaching the largest set of individuals
    underserved by current energy technologies. Our rotor seeks to displace diesel
    generation and complement intermittent renewable energy sources by providing an
    affordable, baseload clean energy solution for any individual or community; with
    the objective of scaling up to larger deployments by leveraging the scalable rotor
    design. This R&D Project will expand the body of knowledge for the rapidly emerging
    field of biomimicry by developing a flexible micro-hydro solution that enables
    energy generation from flowing water by allowing fluids to move over the surfaces
    of the rotor in their naturally preferred way. \n\n\n\nThis project will transform
    our promising proprietary rotor design into an optimized MHK turbine to be incorporated
    as the key component of a flexible micro-hydro system that addresses many of the
    challenges faced by the MHK market. The rotor is based on biomimicry and was designed
    using streamlines found in moving bodies of water with a deep profile to maximize
    the power transfer from low speed flows. The logarithmic design with receding
    edges results in a turbine that avoids damaging impacts with debris and marine
    life. The design is stable in variable flow conditions, which allows for a flexible
    power takeoff configuration with both the generator and power electronics housed
    above the water for improved affordability. During the project, computational
    fluid dynamic modeling will be used to simulate design changes and drive performance
    improvements. The most promising designs will be prototyped and integrated with
    multiple generator and tether combinations to determine the most efficient flexible
    power takeoff system. Conversion to power output for 12V battery charging will
    also be tested and optimized resulting in a complete power conversion chain. The
    performance of the rotor and system will be characterized by full scale testing
    locally and with The University of Washington."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in its ability to improve healthcare in fundamental ways, such as (1) low volume draws that will enable diagnostics in low-resource settings like drug stores, at home, or in developing countries, (2) higher quality small-volume samples to make Point-of-Care (POC) diagnostics more competitive with lab tests, enabling faster results in critical care/outpatient environments, and (3) low draw volumes, coupled with small volume diagnostic tests, that will enable improved care for patients at risk for hospital-acquired anemia, including neonates and patients with bone marrow damage caused by cancers or suppressed bone marrow due to cancer drugs. Our technology will enable medical testing from a small amount of blood, which could significantly impact global neonatal and pediatric healthcare, particularly in developing countries, and expand the market for blood containers.


    This project aims to design a microliter-scale blood container that offers the same analytic stability and consistency as blood samples obtained by larger volume tubes.  Critical to specimen stability is the ability to rapidly and uniformly distribute an anticoagulant in a blood specimen.  In larger containers, mixing is achieved by shaking a collection tube, creating turbulent flow wherein eddies and vortices mix the blood with the stabilizing reagent.  In low volume containers, fluid flow is laminar and shaking does not produce mixing.  Typical low volume containers rely on diffusion driven mixing.  This process is slow, and frequently results in the formation of micro-clots prior to complete specimen stabilization.  We will use our proprietary actuated, surface-attached posts (ASAP) to rapidly and thoroughly distribute anticoagulant in blood, increasing the accuracy and the reproducibility of results obtained from small volume draws.  This project will begin with an assessment of the biocompatibility of materials and specimen processing procedures.  We will test a number of ASAP configurations in order to minimize the time required for specimen stabilization.  The project will culminate with the production of a fully functional prototype that will be validated via comparison against blood stabilized in a larger volume specimen tube.

    on developing compact camera modules with lower noise and improved contrast using
    a submicron pixel imaging sensor array. The commercial potential of this project
    centers on developing compact cameras for endoscopes, navigational and robotic
    surgical systems and more. Embedding these cameras in endoscope systems, and even
    the surgical tools themselves, permits new treatments across a broad range of
    medical specialties that otherwise are not possible. Switching to the minimally
    invasive forms of some common surgeries could save an estimated $14 billion in
    healthcare spending. Oncology, urology, gastroenterology, women's health and pediatric
    medicine are just some of the specialties that will significantly benefit from
    these ultra-compact cameras. A broader impact will ultimately come from utilizing
    submicron pixels in unique ways in high density arrays. The sensor?s small size
    and fast response times offer unique opportunities for spatial and temporal oversampling.
    The resulting large numbers of pixels can be employed in a compact multi-aperture
    arrangement to deliver significantly enhanced color mapping over traditional semiconductor
    imaging arrays, multispectral imaging, 3-dimensional image reconstruction, motion
    free auto-focusing, or some combination of the above, providing unique applications
    in medical imaging, defense, robotics, and consumer electronics.  \n\nThe miniaturization
    of camera systems calls for the continuous shrinking of pixel sizes. At a certain
    point, however, the maximum photo-electrons a pixel can hold becomes limited,
    yielding low signal-to-noise ratios and poor dynamic range. This project develops
    a novel optical sensor that maintains sensitivity down to hundreds of nanometers.
    As the size of this sensor decreases, the maximum measurable light intensity can
    remain constant and the signal-to-noise increases, bringing significant improvements
    to images? dynamic range and color/feature rendition. This result stands in stark
    contrast to the behavior of conventional pixels where maximum intensity threshold
    scales down with pixel size and noise increases with decreasing pixel size. Reducing
    these image sensors to practice requires transitioning from gallium arsenide based
    devices to silicon.  The work focuses on 1) finalizing design parameters, fabrication,
    and characterization of the electrical properties and optical response of the
    system and 2) fabrication and characterization of a linear photodetector array
    for the creation of both linear images and 2-D images assembled from linear images
    to characterize the noise, contrast and other image quality parameters of the
    prototype."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in providing manufactured concrete blocks that can be used to build arches, including roofs.  This feature has never been done with manufactured concrete block, and holds the potential to greatly expand the uses, benefits and capabilities of concrete block to an entirely new market segment.  The structures expected to be made possible with this novel masonry system include inexpensive, high-performance, energy efficient buildings with increased fire safety ratings, resistance to termites, increased safety for tornadoes, hurricanes, tsunamis and other sever weather events, and greatly increased building life cycle time. This technology could have a large positive economic impact on masonry construction and on the concrete block manufacturing industry in particular, both across the US and around the globe.  This work is expected to provide a greater understanding of the anisotropic strength of manufactured concrete block, and how this anisotropic strength is to be maximized within a given structure; this scientific understanding is expected to benefit the catenary thrust-line analysis of masonry arches.  This technology is expected to make superior construction available to homeowners, businesses, government buildings and public works (including bridges) at greatly reduced cost.


    This project will create a design for a building which will utilize as many of the common features made available by this masonry system which the average user (homeowner, building owner, business, government agency, etc.) is expected to want to use.  This building will be designed as a planetarium for Alfred University's Stull Observatory, and will include a twenty-four foot diameter planetarium room, as a domed hemisphere, made as a third frequency truncated icosahedron.  This building will also include a separate meeting room and a separate office.  This building will include Gothic windows, arched roofs, and flying buttresses which will create an outdoor porch which rings the outside of this building.  This building will be designed with a Professional Engineer and a Registered Design Professional (architect) to show all the equations, stress analyses, free body diagrams, etc., which were used to arrive at the final design.  Once completed, this building will serve as a test or sample building used to obtain an Evaluation Report by the International Code Council - Evaluation Services (ICC-ES).  A positive Evaluation Report from ICC-ES will allow this technology to be sold globally in accordance with the International Building Code (IBC).

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve the quality of care for anterior ocular wounds. To accomplish this, the project is focused on the development of a novel, hand-held, point-of-care device that can be used to evaluate the ocular surface in post-trauma or post-surgical patients. The device should be able to provide an accurate, objective measurement of a tear film biomarker that can be used by medical professionals to identify dangerous fluid leaks in the front of the eye which can save vision. Currently, this evaluation is only performed by trained eye doctors and requires positioning the patient at an expensive, immobile machine called a slit lamp to evaluate their eye. This cannot be done on patients who are unconscious or uncooperative and availability of this machine is limited. The lack of adequate tools for evaluation results in limited access to care, costly hospital transfers and missed diagnosis of wound leaks which can cause severe ocular infections and permanent vision loss. Successful commercialization of this product is expected to improve the accuracy of ocular examinations in 3.8 million Americans annually and may introduce a new frontier of tear film testing.


    The proposed project is focused on developing the device for direct use for patient care. The technological aim of the research is on the creation of a sophisticated biosensor that can accurately and noninvasively evaluate the tear film concentration of a specific biomarker. This work is expected to include the development of the electrical circuitry, the chemical composition and the channels for connection to the base unit. The plan is to also design the model for the handheld device. In order to make the device safe for patient use, the device can then be tested for its shelf-life stability and develop the proper sterilization. The next steps of testing can include clinical patients to evaluate the ability of the device to record the findings from the tear film. This information can then be used to refine the exact testing parameters for the device. The anticipated result of this research is a final prototype of the device that can be used for regulatory approval and clinical trials. The goal of the project is to transform the current standard of care for eye professionals and enable physicians to have an objective measure that can warn them about possible wound leaks and potentially save vision.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is to overcome limitations that prevent effective treatment of wound infections. There is a large potential market for this product as the U.S. spends over $50 billion per year on wound care and current wound care products have a high risk of rejection, scarring, and antibiotic resistance. The proposed novel wound care product will reduce the costs to treat infected wounds and limit the number of medical procedures required to restore tissue function. The product consists of a patented human extracellular matrix (hECM) coupled to a novel antimicrobial peptide (AMP). The main innovation of the proposed product, compared to current treatments, is that it is designed to be toxic to infective bacteria and other pathogens, without harming human tissue. The hECM has regenerative and anti-inflammatory activity to enhance wound healing and improve treatment outcomes. In addition to creating a transformative product in a global market, achievement of AMP extracellular matrix tethering will lead to a broader understanding of AMP activity and unlock their commercial utility. The product can be used as a temporary wound dressing, a tissue restoring implant, or an implant coating.


    The proposed project will utilize a patented recombinant protein with an antimicrobial peptide, combined with a human extracellular matrix (hECM) material. The patented antimicrobial protein (AMP) is designed to bind collagen in the hECM. The combination of hECM and AMP will result in an antimicrobial regenerative matrix that will reduce the incidence of infection and improve wound healing. The objectives of the project are to scale-up hECM and AMP manufacturing processes, establish methods for assessing product characteristics and performance for manufacturing quality assurance and release criteria, and evaluate the shelf-life and in vivo performance of the scaled-up manufactured AMP-hECM product in a clinically relevant infectious wound healing model.  The AMP-hECM will be evaluated using biochemical, antimicrobial, mechanical and cell growth performance assays.  Scale-up of the bioengineered AMP and hECM will be achieved by optimizing the in vitro manufacturing bioreactor growth parameters and processing methods to improve overall product yield.  The anticipated outcome of the project is to have defined the large-scale manufacturing protocols and release criteria for the AMP-hECM product. This milestone will enable the execution of validation production runs, and advance the regulatory and commercialization pathways for the product.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is in the improvement of atmospheric state observations from various platforms. This compact, integrated and ?plug and play? receiver design will make the existing observations more available, more economical, and will also enable previously unattainable observations of water vapor distributions within the atmosphere. This environmental sensor?s small size and low power requirements enables its deployment on various airborne, spaceborne or ground-based platforms, such as unmanned aerial aircraft, nanosatellites, ocean buoys, and remotely located ground-based instruments. One promising commercial application is private weather observing satellite constellations. It has been estimated that around 400 remote sensing nano/microsatellites will be launched worldwide between the years of 2016-2018. Water vapor and cloud observations are among the most important observations promising further understanding of weather events and to better synoptic or mesoscale forecasts. Improved atmospheric observations are directly related to increasingly accurate and useful weather forecasts. The benefits are expected to extend widely across the economy. Meteorologists point to more accurate and rapidly refreshed atmospheric observations as one of the necessities for the continuous improvements in weather forecasting, understanding of the atmospheric physics and climate.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project will complete the design and build a fully functional prototype of a very compact, direct detection radiometer receiver, operating in the vicinity of the 183 GHz water vapor absorption line. All the receiver components will be designed and evaluated, including a noise source, detectors, filters, Monolithic Microwave Integrated circuits and others, first as individual parts and then within the assembly. A novel receiver architecture and integration of all components into one assembly allow for a drastic reduction in the receiver size and reduction of its power consumption, while improving its observational capabilities and stability. There are several aspects of the proposed effort that are unique and would provide profound advances in ultra-compact microwave radiometry. The receiver is expected to consume less than 0.5 Watt of power and weigh around 100 grams, with a continuous two-point calibration capability at its input.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will address a pressing need for more environmentally responsible coating alternatives in the anti-corrosion market through the commercialization of a novel aluminum-based coating.   If successfully commercialized, the aluminum electroplating process will displace multiple existing anti-corrosion coatings, which are based on toxic metals.  The current market for these coatings is valued at $10 billion annually.  The replacement of the toxic metals with aluminum will eliminate their release into the environment.  The process is also expected to be less expensive than the incumbent technologies.  The reduction in cost arises from decreases in plating solution, waste treatment, and metal costs.  By decreasing the cost of corrosion-resistant coatings, it may also be possible to reduce the flow of plating jobs to less environmentally responsible areas overseas.  For the aerospace industry, which is the initial target market, the availability of the process will mean safer conditions for workers, less environmental impact, and lower costs. In the process of addressing these needs in the coatings market, the research will elucidate a variety of interesting phenomena associated with electroplating of highly active metal species.

    The intellectual merit of this project is associated with its exploration of aqueous electroplating of highly active metals in the presence of atmospheric moisture and oxygen.  Typically, electroplating of aluminum has taken place from organic solvents such as toluene at elevated temperatures under an inert purge.  The expense and difficulty in scaling this technology has prevented its adoption for many applications, which might make good use of aluminum coatings.  The goal of the project will be to overcome the technical challenges in scaling-up an aqueous aluminum electroplating process for producing aluminum coatings.  Challenges to be addressed include mass transfer, current distribution, and coating quality control in industrial-scale plating baths.  To address these challenges, the project team will work closely with partners in the electroplating industry, ultimately demonstrating the technology at scale in a working commercial plating shop.

    revise a video game. Emerging technologies, such as educational videogames, have
    the potential to increase the accessibility of learning materials, promote readiness
    and knowledge of employment options, and improve students' attitudes toward full-time
    employment. Unfortunately, the lack of an accessible, coherent career planning
    system in the United States has left many high school students unprepared to meet
    the rigorous demands associated with being college and career ready. This project
    will teach critical life, social, and academic skills related to a career in Science,
    Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). This project is designed to enhance
    student learning, reduce school costs, and increase the efficacy of transition
    plans, which are mandated for every student with a disability under Federal law.
    The game aligns with Common Core Standards and the Universal Design for Learning
    framework. While this project will be designed for students with disabilities,
    it is assumed the highly accessible career preparation software will also meet
    a critical need for other students at risk of learning failure or students without
    disabilities. \n\nThis project is a critical component of a comprehensive product
    line that will provide adolescents with virtual career training. During the project,
    participants will experience mini-games related to their daily living skills,
    a \"day in the life\" of a person in a STEM career, and social skills that those
    allow individuals to interpret different cultures in a STEM environment. A virtual
    mentor coaches the student to make choices that will lead to career advancement
    and explains the hierarchy of jobs within the chosen career. The virtual mentor
    also provides financial advice throughout the daily living games, modeling exemplary
    fiscal management and reinforcing decisions that have a high likelihood of leading
    to financial stability. The project team will build, test, analyze, and revise
    the mini-games and then compile the revisions into a beta version of the game.
    Initial friends and family tests of the alpha builds will include qualitative
    evaluation using observations and interviews. This will be followed with beta
    testing in public schools using a mixed methods design. Beta testing will include
    students with and without disabilities in grades six through nine, special education
    and general education teachers, counselors and parents."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop a hormone-free treatment alternative for women suffering from vaginal atrophy. Vaginal atrophy is a condition in which the vaginal tissue is thin, dry, and inelastic. Women with vaginal atrophy experience day-to-day vaginal dryness and pain with intercourse. This SBIR project catalyzes the development of a technology platform that will enable a novel home-use, hormone-free medical device to treat vaginal atrophy. This project represents a medical device treatment for vaginal atrophy developed specifically for women wishing to avoid hormone-based therapies. Currently available treatment options fall in two categories: over-the-counter products and hormone-replacement therapies. Over-the-counter products, like lubricants, are available at drugstores, but these products are often limited in their efficacy relative to the severity of symptoms many women experience. Hormone-replacement therapies on the other hand, such as estrogen creams, can be effective for women; however they are contraindicated for large market segments of women (e.g. breast cancer survivors and women with cardiovascular risk factors). Therefore, this SBIR project is critical to the development of a safe treatment alternative for women and represents a chance to significantly improve their quality of life.

    The proposed project supports the technical work required to develop this medical device treatment and addresses a major unmet need for breast cancer survivors and post-menopausal women. The work supported by this SBIR grant will complete necessary device improvements and prepare the technology platform for commercialization. The main objectives of this project are to 1) optimize the device for safety and usability, 2) execute specific design enhancements to ensure cost-effective manufacturability, and 3) complete all necessary quality system testing to meet FDA (Food and Drug Administration) requirements. To achieve the first objective, the company will complete all prescribed activities under the company's quality management system. User interviews will also be completed with device prototypes to explore features that enable and encourage appropriate device use. This work will be completed in cooperation between the company's engineering team and an outside industrial design firm. The second objective will require design for manufacturing activities, which will also be completed in a partnership with an outside firm. The third objective will be executed again by following the company's quality management system policies, processes, and procedures. All of these activities, once complete, will ensure the company's device is ready for commercialization.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the result of introducing a new generation of low-power wireless sensors for detecting Acoustic Emission events and detecting fatigue damage in structures. According to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), the US transportation infrastructure has 605,102 operational bridges, of which 66,561 are structurally deficient. In particular, the fatigue damage monitoring technology of the project will initially target the more than 18,000 US highway bridges that are categorized as ?fracture critical? by the Federal Highway Administration. The technique?s ultra-low energy consumption will enable its use in low-power wireless sensors and make it an ideal response to this challenging problem. The anticipated benefits and commercial applications of this project are (1) a low-cost, easy-to-use mechanism for effective monitoring, allowing for early detection and timely repair of fracture and fatigue damage in infrastructure systems such as highway bridges; (2) improved public safety, with reduced maintenance costs and extension of the service life of critical and high-valued infrastructure systems; and (3) additional commercial applications in monitoring the structural health and integrity of other structures, including aircraft, oil and gas pipelines, machinery, cargo cranes, ships, etc.

    Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project addresses distributed structural health monitoring (SHM) of infrastructure systems, particularly highway bridges. Because the creation of fatigue cracks in a structure is accompanied by the propagation of acoustic emission (AE) waves, wireless AE sensors can be used to detect such cracks. However, a challenge of AE detection sensors is high energy consumption, significantly more than the energy available in a battery-operated wireless device. As a result, conventional AE detection methods cannot be used with low-power wireless sensors. This project uses a novel and ultra-low power technique for long term monitoring of strain.  Then, AE monitoring is activated only if history of tensile strain in the structure under monitoring suggests likelihood of fatigue damage. In addition, using history and pattern of AE events, the method estimates the severity of fatigue damage in a material. Moreover, the method uses a variety of techniques to eliminate the effects of mechanical noise on AE measurements and achieve a high reliability in fatigue damage assessment. After development, the method is planned to be evaluated on highway bridges, airframes, and pipelines.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to a wide range of electronics in the areas of communications, Internet, portable electronics, and power electronics. Although magnetic based transformers have been the industry standard for over a century they have many negatives including miniaturization difficulties, electromagnetic interference issues, and issues with larger voltage step-up applications. The main goal of the research is to develop a ceramic replacement for magnetic transformers that is both conducive to miniaturization, provides higher power densities, provides a large increase in safe operating temperatures, and that is cost competitive with standard magnetic devices. This technology will provide important advantages for many applications; the ability to produce at low cost also opens up large new markets that are not easily reached using conventional magnetics.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase 2 project aims to develop new low temperature sintering processes and transformer structures that enable the use of base metal electrodes to replace very expensive platinum. This drastically reduces costs of ceramic transformers and substantially improves performance due to the fact that a poor electrical/thermal conductor, Platinum, is now replaced with base metal (Copper) that is a high performance electrical/thermal conductor. This translates into both higher power throughput in devices that are lighter weight and lower profile and also a new ability to now match the high temperature range of wide bandgap power devices. The success of this program immediately leads to a revolutionary next step of being able to insert power management/conversion electronics directly within integrated circuits such as in application specific integrated circuits (ASIC) and field programmable gate arrays (FPGA).

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research, Phase II project is to help make therapy more consistent with patient preferences, beliefs, and values to maximize engagement in therapy and improve patient outcomes. Therapy for mental health problems is highly effective, yet many patients drop out before getting the full benefit because they are not satisfied or engaged in the therapy. The proposed project involves collecting data on all of patients actions in the online treatment system along with their ratings of each activity and their symptom improvement over time. The research and development team will use this data to create a machine learning system that will make suggestions for best next steps in therapy based on what thousands of other users experienced. This is the intelligent counseling system. It will work very similarly to movie streaming services or online book sellers who recommend movies or books to you based on your past preferences and the preferences of thousands of other users.

    The proposed project will develop a feedback and recommendation system based on advanced analytics and machine learning techniques to provide personalized treatments to customize and individualize online mental health treatment, the Intelligent Counseling System (ICS). This personalized system will contain a number of alternative treatment items from several theoretical perspectives, using a variety of patient interactive activities, varying in format, length, pace, and other characteristics. In such a setting, a recommendation system can predict the users' preferences and recommend the subsequent treatment component. In addition, to achieve maximum adherence and to decrease the attrition rate, the platform will enable personalized motivational interventions and supportive messaging. The delivery times and the content of supportive messaging will adapt and vary depending on the projected treatment progress. Our machine learning based system will be trained incrementally as more data becomes available over time, thus it will benefit from improved accuracy over time. We will extract local, semi-local, and global temporal features at multiple temporal resolutions and will use feature selection techniques to identify which factors contribute to the success of treatments for patients, and to predict if a user is improving or is deteriorating. This will result in adaptive motivational messages and recommendation for tailoring treatment in term of important identified treatment features.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is the development of a portable, low cost blood typing and anemia screening device for use in blood donation centers, hospitals, humanitarian efforts and the military.   This helps society because every two seconds in United States someone needs blood, yet less than 4% of Americans donate blood.  Unfortunately, 15-20% of blood collected is wasted due to over collection of unneeded blood types and related blood type logistics.  12 million units of blood are collected annually in US with 108 million units worldwide.   U.S. blood centers are under significant economic pressures to reduce per unit blood costs and thus waste reduction tools and strategies are in demand.  Blood unit costs approach $200 per pint of blood, so this device provides the ability to pre-screen donors by blood type and selectively direct the donation process (i.e. plasma, red cells) to reduce blood product waste and better match supply with hospital demand.   This portable technology could also be translated to remote geographical locations for disaster relief applications. The potential economic savings has the potential to be $400M and will contribute to reducing the overall cost of U.S. health care.

    The proposed project will advance knowledge across multiple fields.  It adapts knowledge in microfluidics and the use of electric fields to characterize cells to identify the molecular expression on blood cells responsible for ABO-Rh blood type.  This project advances the use of electric fields to rapidly measure cell concentration.  This project develops software for real time tracking of cell population motion, which is highly valuable in many cell microscopy applications.  This project also adapts advanced pattern recognition tools like machine learning to extract even more information from the cell behaviors. This work also extends statistical analysis from static population means to analysis of functional data - a field in its infancy - via a critical application.   Finally, the device and electronics engineering will advance under the principle that "simple is best", leading to fewer potential failure points and less costly manufacture. This work advances scientific knowledge and will be published and widely disseminated after securing additional IP. It is also a powerful alternative to expensive antigen/antibody molecular recognition reactions (i.e. traditional blood typing) for medical screening and diagnosis for future point of care diagnostic applications.

- abstractText: "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project intends
    to meet the need for low cost dose-on-demand production of Carbon-11 isotope for
    biomarker and radiotracer applications in nuclear medicine.  Biomarkers and radiotracers
    are commonly used for Positron Emission Tomography and Computed Tomography (PET/CT)
    metabolic imaging, in support of research, drug discovery, and detection of cancer
    and other illnesses.  They are also used for therapy staging of cancer, to determine
    if treatment is effective.  Common examples include myocardial perfusion imaging
    of the heart to visualize blood flow and function, PET scanning of the brain to
    detect early onset Alzheimer's and brain tumors, and Choline PET/CT for the diagnosis
    and staging of prostate cancer. Carbon-11 is an important radiotracer/radiopharmaceutical
    that offers unique advantages due to its ability to be easily incorporated into
    many molecules without impacting biological activity.  Carbon-11 is currently
    produced by using specialized targets on high-energy commercial cyclotrons.  These
    cyclotrons cost millions of dollars to install, and existing targets are inefficient.
    \ Low energy cyclotrons are significantly less expensive, and are currently under
    development by multiple commercial companies.  This project seeks to develop a
    novel cyclotron target methodology for producing Carbon-11 at low energies using
    unique nanomaterials, resulting in significantly lower costs.  \n\nThe intellectual
    merit of this project is in the use of novel nanomaterials to produce Carbon-11
    more efficiently and at lower cost, through development of recoil escape targets.
    \ It is challenging to find a good target material suitable for both efficient
    production of Carbon-11, by one of several available nuclear reactions, and efficient
    recovery of the produced radiotracer in a usable form.  The produced Carbon-11
    can be difficult to recover, as it is easily trapped in many conventional target
    materials, resulting in low yields.  Recent advances in nanoscience and technology
    allow for production of novel materials with unique characteristics.  Boron nitride
    nanotubes (BNNT) are composed of fibers with single atomic thickness, or at most
    a few atoms thick, allowing Carbon-11 to be efficiently produced and recovered
    in the form of carbon dioxide gas using low energy cyclotrons.  Prototype production
    targets will be developed and tested at commercial cyclotron sites.  The process
    for collecting the produced Carbon-11 gas will be optimized to achieve the highest
    yields of usable radiotracer material.  Efforts will be made to further develop
    BNNT materials with ideal characteristics, including high purity and optimal density."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is the reduction of deaths and long-term disabilities in people suffering from bleeding in the brain caused by intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) or traumatic brain injury. Currently, physicians detect worsening bleeding through a clinical exam where a patient shows outward signs of deterioration in their neurological status. By the time these signs of additional bleeding appear, much of the damage to the brain has already occurred. About a third of people who suffer a severe traumatic brain injury either die or are left disabled. For hemorrhagic stroke, 60% die and 70% of survivors are left with significant disabilities. A device which transmits and receives very low power radiofrequency signals has been created that can be put on a patients head. The presence of blood outside of the brain's vessels and arteries creates a characteristic change in the radio signal used by the device. Using radio waves to non-invasively detect brain bleeds will allow treatment to start sooner, which will save lives, reduce disabilities and lower the cost of treating severe brain injuries.

    The proposed project tests (i) the ability of the device to detect and characterize small changes in ICH size and location over time and (ii) the ability to display changes in the bleed in a meaningful way to physicians. An algorithm for determining the size and location of the hemorrhage will be tested using both a phantom model that mimics the human brain and an IACUC-approved pig ICH model. Multiple hemorrhage volumes and locations will be used to test the algorithm's ability to detect hemorrhage volume changes within 1 mL, location within 1 cm, and distinguish changes due to the hemorrhage from physiological changes in a living pig's brain. Signal measurements taken before, during, and after infusion of blood will be captured at each time point to test the accuracy of the algorithm. Software will be developed to display the information from the algorithm in three-dimensions while giving doctors and nurses control over thresholds for triggering an alarm and how often the device scans. To test the software, the data collected during the pig experiments will be used to determine how accurate the display matches the location and size of the hemorrhage from CT images collected during testing.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is very significant. Suboptimal operational decision-making in emergency departments and hospitals leads to inefficiencies that result in excessive patient wait-times, the diversion of ambulances to other emergency departments, wasted resources and patients who either leave before being treated or against medical advice. By connecting modern analytical approaches, including statistical modeling and systems engineering methods, to real-time data routinely collected by hospitals, the proposed project promises to result in a tremendously valuable analytics platform that will assist administrators in making dozens of operational and staffing decisions each day. This informed decision-making will not only improve hospital efficiency, it will lead to both healthier and more satisfied patients and simultaneous dramatic increases in revenue and profit. The technology proposed will have the potential to add significant value to the approximately 5,000 hospitals in the U.S., often on the order of millions of dollars annually. Hospitals and health systems now realize the value of effective analytics, and the analytics platform proposed here will be an obvious investment for any emergency department or hospital whose goal is to provide the best care to its patients at lower costs.

    The proposed project promises to yield a set of decision-support applications upon which emergency departments and hospitals will base their decisions each day. Substantial investments by hospitals and health systems on information technology, and in particular, electronic health records, have set the stage for evidence-based, data-driven decisions. These decisions will effectively leverage real-time data along with analytical methods such as statistical forecasting and event-simulation modeling. In particular, this proposed project will develop software applications, based on these analytical methods and linking to real-time data sources, tailored to emergency departments and hospitals. This project will involve 1) addressing the real-time needs of hospital operational decision-makers, 2) further developing a statistical and simulation modeling platform to inform these real-time needs, specifically reflecting emergency departments and whole hospitals, and 3) ultimately ensuring that actionable insights are delivered in a timely and intuitive manner to key stakeholders. These actionable insights that derive from the data and sophisticated methods must be delivered to the right decision-maker at the right time and in the right format, but will then have the capacity to substantially improve both the quality and efficiency of care-delivery throughout the hospital.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project includes the reduction in severe patient morbidity and elimination of hundreds of millions of dollars of expenditures by the U.S. healthcare system each year on revision surgeries and unnecessary procedures associated with late detection of post-surgical blood clots. Surgeons have the ability to prevent these catastrophic events, but only if the onset of the clot can be detected in a timely manner. Currently, of the patients who form clots after the targeted surgeries, half will suffer from a surgical failure due to the shortcomings of current modalities. This technology gives clinicians the ability to non-invasively track changes in blood flow within critical vessels to enable intervention prior to any compromise in health and prevent a majority of these catastrophic incidents. Beyond significant decreases in patient suffering and morbidity, such interventions will have an enormous positive economic impact on the health care system. This technology can also substantially improve clinical understanding of the clotting process and possibly enable non-invasive therapeutic treatments for these patients who otherwise would receive surgery.

    The proposed project offers significant intellectual and scientific merit associated with new methods of ultrasound flow analysis. The objective of this work is to develop a system that is able to collect a 3D volume of ultrasound data and automatically extract the blood flow data in the region of interest by detecting an implantable component. This novel approach to measuring vascular flow will be the first to enable detection of localized post-operative clot formation rather than detecting clot-related issues via delayed and indirect methods that leave patients at risk for surgical failures. This technique can allow for intervention earlier than all other available methods, thus improving patient outcomes and reducing hospital costs. Furthermore, this method enables automatic detection of critical changes in blood flow, eliminating the risk of human error. Lastly, dissemination of the technology developed in this proposal represents an important milestone towards the creation of simpler, more automated ultrasound systems that can place this non-invasive, non-ionizing modality in the hands of non-expert clinicians for use in a broader spectrum of medical applications.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to enable
    wireless industry carriers and equipment providers with an affordable technology
    solution to meet the continuing explosive societal/customer demands for data access.
    The telecommunication market sector has been increasingly consolidating to Asia
    and Europe where foreign governments are making strategic investments to encourage
    work in their respective countries. In a long-term, the proposed interference
    elimination technology can lead to increased investment in the telecom equipment
    sector and efficient use of the finite radio frequency (RF) spectrum in the United
    States.   The expected technical and commercial outcome from the project is an
    active interference mitigation capability with product features including a significantly
    improved quality of service, simplified network equipment design and installation,
    and reduced requirements for many components such as antenna and filters. This
    in turn will reduce the overall cost per data link, as well as reducing the size,
    weight, and power requirements of the system. \n\nThis Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project addresses the critical need for disruptive RF
    interference mitigation solutions. As networks are moving toward higher performance
    to accommodate larger capacity than ever seen before, the network operators, industry
    organizations, and equipment providers are looking into innovative technologies
    for next generation 5G wireless networks.  There are two advantages offered by
    the proposed interference elimination technology. One advantage is extreme wide
    instantaneous bandwidth and the other is flexible tunability over GHz of operating
    frequency.  These advantages help to consolidate and reduce front-end hardware.
    The focus of this program will be first on developing an optical system-on-chip
    version of the interference cancellation system with monolithically photonic integrated
    circuits. With a complete and fully function development board, the second focus
    will be on demonstrating the application in in-band interference mitigation for
    wireless backhaul networks, and showing improvement in 2x spectral efficiency
    and potential 1000x increase in capacity."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to create a suite of consumer hardware and software products that provide realistic tactile feedback to users who are touching objects in virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR). As evidenced by the current proliferation of low-cost head-mounted displays and motion tracking systems, three-dimensional interaction technologies are revolutionizing how people interact with computers, media, and each other. Since they are currently limited to vision and audio, endowing consumer-level human-computer interfaces with high-fidelity tactile feedback will vastly increase user immersion, making games more fun, online interactions more effective, and tools more efficient. Consequently, this project has the potential to expand the commercial reach of the burgeoning VR/AR market, opening up myriad opportunities for companies particularly in the gaming, entertainment, and e-commerce sectors. The innovation of this project also promises to enhance scientific and technological understanding of haptic human-computer interaction by establishing a new paradigm that blends minimal wearable hardware with sophisticated software algorithms. Finally, commercializing novel interactive technology also has the potential to help inspire a diverse array of young people to pursue a career in the critical areas of science, technology, engineering, and math.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project aims to advance knowledge of low-cost technology that can provide realistic tactile feedback to a user touching objects in VR or AR: the project?s intellectual merits center on testing a new approach that combines minimal haptic hardware and sophisticated software algorithms. The research objective is to create a fully functional industrial prototype of a wearable fingertip thimble and custom software that embody the proposed approach. When the user's finger moves to touch a virtual object, a platform inside the thimble will initiate contact with the fingerpad and press with a force that varies with penetration distance, to render surface softness. A thermal actuator will convey the object?s thermal conductivity and temperature. When the finger slides along a virtual object, the user will feel its texture via carefully designed platform vibrations. Specific research tasks to be addressed include exploring haptic actuator options, building a library of haptic object properties (HOPs) that can be applied to virtual objects, and creating a communication protocol for exchanging haptic signals among devices. This project is expected to yield a fully functional industrial prototype and developer kits for the wearable fingertip thimble.

- abstractText: "This Phase II project impacts the way engineering design is taught
    in design courses and contributes to the training of a strong workforce in areas
    related to science, technology and engineering. The Ecosystem is a software tool
    that automatically verifies designs against the requirements, to uncover oversights
    early in the process, but also fosters engineering judgement and creativity, allows
    for assessment of designs with less subjectivity, and facilitates smooth communication
    among team members. This results in productivity enhancements, higher quality
    designs and shorter time-to-market, but also in societal benefits (safer products,
    less risk of catastrophic accidents and more competitive design organizations).
    The target market consists of (1) educational institutions teaching engineering
    design, and (2) design companies striving to ensure compliance with the design
    specifications.  The core innovation is three-fold.  First, it consists of an
    e-design assessment engine that is being developed to a high degree of sophistication.
    \ Second, design repositories are investigated and developed for integration.
    \ Third, holistic (big data) analysis of design content and metadata is implemented.
    \n\nThe project seeks to develop an innovative design decision (learning) support
    system addressing problems related to the high cost of design oversights. Such
    oversights can result in catastrophic failures, product recalls, or simply in
    budget or schedule over-runs (due to rework).  The Ecosystem offers a flexible,
    yet systematic and generic, framework, for guiding designers through the design
    process, and for automatically assessing design activities, from each stage in
    the design process, against the product design specification (PDS). At the center
    of the Ecosystem is the e-design assessment engine, which decomposes the PDS,
    correlates the design activities against individual requirements, and provides
    real-time advisories in case of design oversights. The assessment engine automatically
    configures popular development tools for engineering design, determines relevant
    analyses, and interprets the outputs. The Ecosystem interfaces with these development
    tools, but does not replace. The Ecosystem can translate qualitative customer
    requirements into solid engineering requirements, and verify the relevance of
    the design content provided through seamless interfaces with industry databases.
    The Ecosystem improves designers' productivity through automation of many administrative
    tasks (e.g., generation of project reports). Despite the automation, the learning
    experience is not diminished. The Ecosystem prompts for, captures, and preserves
    the rationale for relevant engineering decisions. It also supports accredited,
    generic learning objectives for engineering design."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to provide wireless technology for economic high-speed internet connectivity in under-served rural regions, addressing the needs of 40 million Americans and over 50% of the global population. The technological developments in this project will pave the way for adoption of Massive, or Many-Antenna MIMO technologies in next-generation wireless systems by addressing scalability bottlenecks with innovative hardware and protocol design. The result of this project will be a revolutionary new wireless system for internet service providers addressing an $80 billion fixed wireless systems market and connecting under-served global communities to high-speed internet commerce, communications, education, and entertainment.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project will develop a production-ready Television White Space (TVWS) Massive MU-MIMO wireless system for IP data traffic, then use it to characterize for the first time diverse, large-scale multi-user TVWS channels. This project will demonstrate the first economically-viable Massive MIMO system, as well as the first point-to-multipoint wireless system capable of non-line-of-sight ranges over 10s of miles with over 2 Gbps of aggregate capacity. The system will be used to measure and characterize TVWS channels at scale in various rural environments, with large beamforming arrays serving tens of clients tens of miles away. In particular, these measurements will explore the effect of range, environment, user separation, and polarization on real-world achievable capacity. The results will be used to guide the design, optimization, and deployment of rural TVWS broadband networks across the world.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project lies in its ability to implement multiple-input
    multiple-output (MIMO) detectors of any size. This, in turn, impacts the broad needs of wireless
    communications industry that is always in search of more efficient use of the scarce spectral resources.
    Since its invention 15 years ago, MIMO has been included in all wireless standards, e.g. WiFi,
    WiMAX, and LTE. As of today, MIMO products of sizes up to 4x4 (i.e. 4 transmit and 4 receive
    antennas) have appeared in the market, while the most recent standards, such as IEEE 802.11ac WiFi
    and LTE-Advanced cellular, have specified MIMO sizes as large as 8x8. For WiFi this can mean more
    effective hot-spots in public and workplace settings. For cellular this can mean improved connectivity
    in rural areas with fewer base-station towers, having a positive economic impact. Industry activities
    that attempt to build larger MIMO systems such as 16x16 are occurring. Massive MIMO networks with
    more than 100 antennas at the base stations have recently been proposed for 5G cellular and beyond.
    These trends indicate a large market opportunity for the scalable MIMO technology that this project
    builds upon.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase 2 project plans to develop and
    commercialize a set of intellectual property (IP) software-codes/IP-cores related to multiple-input
    multiple-output (MIMO) communications. These cores address the needs of wireless chipset
    manufacturers. The main hurdle in the design and implementation of MIMO systems is their
    complexity which drives cost and power consumption. The complexity of an optimal MIMO detector
    grows exponentially with the number of transmit antennas. The same is true for most of the near
    optimal MIMO detectors that have been suggested in the literature and adopted by industry. This
    limitation has been the main impediment in developing commercial MIMO systems that support larger
    array sizes with increased range and data rate. This project adopts a novel technology that achieves near
    optimal performance having complexity that only grows linearly with the number of transmit antennas.
    It thus can be used to implement MIMO systems of any size, at an affordable complexity.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will revolutionize the treatment of individuals with autism. One of every sixty-eight US children has autism (over 1.1 million). The estimated cost of providing Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) therapy to those who could benefit is $7.5 billion dollars annually. Societal impacts include: 1) more individuals with autism across the globe will receive treatment regimens that will enable them to live more fulfilled lives and reach their full potential; 2) families whose children are good candidates for treatment and receive it will experience reduced stress and better family life; and 3) the additional lifetime cost of not effectively treating children with autism, which is approximately ten-fold the cost of treatment, will be reduced. Because high-quality, contextually rich ABA performance data will be collected for the first time, efforts to apply data analytics will contribute in two important ways: a) patterns may be discerned across individuals with autism to better understand variations in autism and create therapies to target these differences; b) expansion of the frontiers of data mining to provide guidance in real time will contribute to a number of areas within and beyond ABA therapy.

    The proposed project will optimize therapy outcomes for individuals with autism by transforming agent-based guiding technology into an adaptive and intelligent ABA therapy assistant for supervisors and instructors. The project pushes the boundaries in providing cost-effective, adaptable, intelligent, real-time guidance and data-collection support to instructors that integrates naturally into the instructional process and is easy to learn and use. ABA therapy experts, supervisors and instructors will verify the analyses and resulting guidance incorporated into the technology.  Advanced theories of usability engineering, including some developed by the project team, will be used to build interfaces that supervisors and instructors can intuit without the need for learning new concepts and syntax. The project will utilize the collected logs from multiple sessions with multiple therapy recipients and multiple therapy providers to uncover hidden patterns and assist supervisors in selecting appropriate therapy steps personalized for the individual with autism. The project will build on a large body of recent work in visualization, machine learning on temporal predictive modeling and sequential pattern mining, including some of the previous results of the project team. Special attention will be paid to the recent work in educational data mining and intelligent tutoring.

    This Phase II project is to the first personalized learning platform for hands-on education that works with the billions of mobile devices already in people's hands worldwide. Because the technology works on any mobile device and requires little instructor facilitation, it will be commercially successful in home settings when parents are busy and school settings where budget restrictions limit the number of facilitators. Beyond commercial impact, this project will help address the nation's need to prepare citizens for the 21st century economy, improve science literacy and help provide equal opportunities to underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). This project is an effective teaching tool because it employs personalized learning, where the content and pace of learning are optimized for the individual learner. Personalized learning has already been shown to result in higher learner engagement and increased retention of concepts in educational software. Through the use of proprietary augmented reality and adaptive learning technology, this project brings personalized learning to hands-on STEM education, enabling learners to develop problem solving skills in a more effective, engaging and lower cost way.

    The key innovation in this project is a single software framework combining advanced augmented reality  (AR) and adaptive learning (AL) techniques to capture learners? interactions with real world objects (for example, circuit blocks, fraction bricks or chemistry models) via a mobile device camera, analyze the significance of the interactions and automatically provide personalized guidance to each learner.  The system will be the first to provide a high level API above the complexity of AR and AL, allowing designers of learning experience modules to focus solely on content and user experience instead of hundreds of thousands of lines of complex code associated with AR and AL. The methods employed will be the research, design and development of the augmented reality and adaptive learning engine, its integration with three learning experience modules: circuits, fractions, basic geometry, and an evaluation of the modules. To guide the development, pilot studies utilizing A/B testing with competing approaches, pre and post assessments, and behavioral analysis of users interacting with the system will be conducted periodically.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is improvement in cost-efficiency, energy-efficiency, and quality in manufacturing automation, increasing worker productivity and reducing repetitive motion injuries. This integrated visual-tactile system will be 3-4 times more inexpensive ($20,000 purchase cost vs. existing $65,000-80,000 vision system), improve the speed and accuracy of current robotic handling systems, and facilitate the automation of repetitive, injury-prone manual tasks. By enabling new robotic applications and increasing productivity in current automation, this solution will help the U.S. maintain a competitive domestic manufacturing sector.  In 2009 there were 36,190 logged repetitive motion injuries in the U.S.; the median missed work time from these injuries was 21 days (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics).  This innovative solution will facilitate the automation of repetitive, injury-prone manual tasks and greatly improve the speed, accuracy, and cost-efficiency of current robotic handling systems.  The immediate commercial applications are in industrial robotics, specifically robotics in agile manufacturing. In the long term, the technology will be applied in personal, healthcare, and military robots. The current market potential for tactile sensors for industrial robots is estimated as $576 million - $1.15 billion and expected to more than double by 2025.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project will result in a combined visual-tactile system that will give robots an integrated sense of touch and vision, much like the hand-eye coordination of humans. It incorporates a technically novel compliant tactile sensing solution?a rubber ?skin? that can be molded into any form factor and is inexpensive and durable.  This advanced skin technology can resolve object shape, contact/slip events, and forces of contacted objects.  It will uniquely fuse visual and tactile information for object handling and pose estimation resulting in flexible robotic system that handles objects more like humans do.  This approach addresses key weaknesses in vision-based robotic manufacturing, such as occlusion and dislodging when parts are grasped.  Current industrial robots are restricted in their ability to handle small, irregularly shaped, soft, or fragile parts. Existing solutions rely on expensive and complex 3D-vision systems or repetitive manual labor. This solution is two-fold: (1) A new flexible tactile sensor that can be tailored to a wide variety of form factors; (2) Software to fuse the tactile data with a vision system to estimate pose of objects in pick-and-place tasks.

    the advancement of telerobotic control technology for subsea operations. As humans
    deploy and maintain ever more complex underwater hardware, conduct subsea scientific
    sampling and exploration and develop natural resources in hostile, deep and remote
    locations, the need for ROVs (Remotely Operated Vehicles) is increasing. ROVs
    have transitioned from basic transport and inspection tools to mission critical
    machines for construction, maintenance and intervention. Despite advances in sensing
    and machinery, significant challenges persist which have plagued the industry
    with high costs and unacceptable downtime, as well as safety risks. Limited situational
    awareness, data deluge and inadequate manual operator controls combine to create
    high rates of equipment breakage, unpredictable and inefficient task completion
    and high mission overhead. This work is developing innovative products for 3-dimensional
    visual awareness and computer assisted control systems for subsea teleoperated
    robots. Divers can be replaced in hazardous situations by telerobots using this
    technology. The rate of untoward incidents and their severity will be reduced
    for a large range of subsea activities. Economic benefits include reduced costs,
    new employment opportunities, competitive advantages and contributions to the
    national technological infrastructure in subsea operations. \n\nThis Small Business
    Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project will address fundamental challenges
    of connecting higher-dimensional data from remote environments to intuitive controls.
    Its intellectual merit is the refinement of a collaborative approach to command
    and control allowing ROV pilots to communicate seamlessly with each other and
    the robotic system. This will be done by developing several foundational innovations
    that, separately, enhance capabilities (and may become individual products), and
    that together derive immense value to the customer. These technologies are in
    the areas of: (1) Pilot Interface/Control room software; (2) Sensor fusion and
    processing; (3) Task assistance and workflow management; and (4) Manipulator and
    vehicle control. Successful implementation of visualization, sensor fusion, control
    methods, and haptic virtual fixtures serves as an excellent demonstration example
    of these technologies. With these technologies combined into a single software
    platform and integrated with a robotic system, increased performance, predictability,
    and safety can be achieved in a way that surpasses what is currently possible
    for purely automated or manual robotic systems. Although this work is focused
    on underwater operations, it can also be extended to terrestrial applications,
    such as industrial assembly, welding and machining, nuclear maintenance and robotic
    dredging and excavation."

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be to
    change the fundamental economics of the recycling process. Although it is estimated
    that up to 95% of the waste stream could be recycled, only a third of the 250
    million tons of municipal solid waste that are generated each year in the United
    States is currently diverted. Greater diversion would provide immense savings
    in landfill and processing costs, and benefit the environment as well. Tens of
    millions of pounds of greenhouse gas emissions from virgin material mining may
    be eliminated, and pollution from landfill waste reduced. The existing sorting
    process is expensive and unprofitable, requiring human workers to manually sort
    debris, an extremely dull, dirty, and dangerous profession. This innovation has
    the potential to eliminate these trade-offs between cost and environmental damage.
    \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project will create
    a scalable, integrated robotic system that autonomously sorts material for recycling.
    This advance in autonomous systems is made possible by a series of innovations
    in robotics: (1) tremendous improvements in both computer vision and robotic manipulation,
    allowing for the system to be deployed with virtually zero retrofitting in existing
    facilities; (2) new motion planning techniques that allow for trajectories to
    be generated in real time, customized for the characteristics of the waste, safety,
    and any uncertainty in individual objects? position;&#8232; and (3) modern machine
    learning techniques that allow the system to classify waste at levels approaching
    human performance, with a continual training signal obtained via human supervision.
    These innovations pave the way for a new era in recycling, where waste is sorted
    cheaply, safely, and reliably on a universal scale."

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in bringing epoxy based conductive polymer
    anticorrosion paint system to the market. Corrosion will cost the US economy over
    $1 trillion in 2015. It is highly desirable to develop more effective anticorrosion
    technologies to reduce this huge economic cost of corrosion. The most effective
    anticorrosion pigments in use today are based on heavy metal pigments, such as
    chromates, lead compounds, and zinc/zinc compounds. Environmental, health, and
    safety concerns are driving the elimination of heavy metal pigments. The proposed
    new product will not only reduce toxicity introduced by current heavy-metal based
    anti-corrosion pigments, but also provide much improved corrosion protection.
    The project is especially targeting replacement of the epoxy based zinc-rich primer
    coating systems that are widely used on highway, marine, and energy infrastructures.
    Solving the poor processibility of environmentally friendly conductive polymers
    should enable open up a range of new applications beyond anti-corrosion coatings
    such as electrostatic dissipation, electromagnetic interference shielding, static
    resistant fibers, conductive inks, toners, and adhesives, etc. \n\n\nThe intellectual
    merit of the proposed project lies in using advanced knowledge and understanding
    of anticorrosion coatings. It is generally assumed that organic coatings act as
    barriers to water and oxygen at the coating - environment interface. But corrosion
    of metals is an electrochemical reaction process that relates to both cations
    and anions. The present proposal suggests developing an ion barrier anticorrosion
    coating system: conductive polymer nanoparticle pigmented epoxy primer with a
    topcoat. The combination of the primer and topcoat constructs a barrier to both
    anions and cations, that inhibits the electrochemical corrosion reaction, therefore,
    provides efficient corrosion protection to the metal. This system will not use
    heavy metal anticorrosion pigments any more. If present proposed research succeeds,
    it will demonstrate how an ion barrier coating provides corrosion protection to
    a metal substrate, and how to formulate an ion barrier anticorrosion coating,
    and lead to the next generation of anticorrosion coating."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to provide a new tool revealing important information regarding skeletal muscle strength and health. Muscle weakness is a pervasive problem across our society, including people with joint disease, aging people, obese people, and people with neuromuscular disorders. All of these problems affect muscles across the body in different and non-intuitive ways; however, to date there has not been marketed technology that allows for quantitative measurement of muscle size on a muscle-by-muscle basis and specific analysis to address the muscle weakness problem. Due to the current high cost, the initial targeted customers will be elite athlete organizations, with the goal of using the technology to improve performance as well as to provide more quantitative metrics for predicting injury susceptibility and make return-to-sport decisions. However, with research and development to bring down the cost, the ultimate goal is to make a broadly used clinical tool for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of health conditions related to musculoskeletal disease and mobility, which will have broad societal impact.

    The proposed project will provide a major advancement in image-based modeling and data analysis tools in order to allow high-throughput imaging, rapid and accurate segmentation of muscles and efficient data analysis. Currently, physical therapists, athletic trainers and strength and conditioning coaches only have very blunt tools to assess each individual?s strength and very limited information about the optimal muscle profile. Therefore, training and rehabilitative approaches are developed via experience and trial and error. The technology proposed here solves these problems by making using of an image-to-model pipeline to quantify muscle size and provide valuable and actionable information based on the quantification. However, the obstacles for a wide adoption of this technology include specific magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocols and lengthy image segmentation process. In the previous funding cycle these two problems have been addressed with substantial technology advancements. The proposed activities in this funding cycle will continue the technical development process to further bring down the cost with improved image segmentation process and provide additional value with advanced data analysis. It will ultimately be a revolutionary tool to improve muscle health.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be accomplished through a proprietary technology
    with its extraordinary capability to enable a large number of high-value, hard-to-formulate
    active ingredients for pharmaceutical, food, and personal care products. In the
    pharmaceutical and personal care industries, this technology is able to solubilize
    and enable poorly water-soluble drug substances to achieve enhanced therapeutic
    effect, improved safety profile, and reduced cost. In addition, it may strongly
    support the long-term activities of drug discovery and development through activating

    non-healthy or even hazardous additives, such as artificial colors and preservatives,
    with natural and healthy alternatives, thus greatly contribute to long-term food
    safety and security as well as public health. To achieve commercialization success,
    a solid portfolio of intellectual properties has been established. Seasoned business
    leaders will work with renowned scientists to incorporate cutting-edge technologies
    into drug, food & nutrition, and personal care products.  \n\nThe proposed project
    will substantially support the development of this new technology. The core problem/opportunity
    this technology targets is a large number of high-value whereas poorly water-soluble
    active ingredients that have been challenging the drug and food industry for a
    long time. For example, around 80% of drug candidates identified by modern drug
    discovery technologies are poorly water-soluble. For food, a large number of vitamins,
    nutrients, antioxidants, and natural colors are poorly water-soluble. Overall,
    poorly water-soluble compounds constitute an enormous formulation challenge. To
    address this need, this team has created a platform technology that is highly
    effective and non-specific. The goal of this project is to further develop the
    technology, scale up the synthesis of a core material, obtain the data on its
    safety profile, and advance the commercialization activities by providing prototypes
    to potential customers. This project will be conducted through close collaborations
    among the start-up company, a major university, and a number of major pharmaceutical,
    ingredients, food, and personal care companies. The deliverables of this project
    include the specifications of core material, initial safety evaluations, and prototypes
    provided to customers. This project will support the start-up company to form
    a solid foundation for commercialization and long-term growth."

    This SBIR Phase II project will develop a computer-based tutoring platform that adapts its teaching strategy to each student by monitoring their brain activity.  Access to individualized instruction by teachers or qualified tutors is limited for a vast number of students, particularly in disadvantaged areas and for science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) subjects.  Computer-based teaching technology could meet this demand, but currently relies on indirect inferences of a student's state, and therefore lacks some of the key abilities of human teachers to assess a student during a lesson.  This project will address this challenge by enabling the tutoring system to determine how hard students are thinking and their level of focus. This will be accomplished by measuring a student's brain electrical activity using a newly-developed headset designed specifically for school-aged children.  Information derived from brain activity patterns will be used to guide tutorial topic selection, difficulty of the content and the level of interactivity.  This project could lead to a significant advance in education technology by enhancing the adaptability of computer-based tutoring platforms and expanding the depth of information on student performance available to teachers and parents.  Adaptive computer-based education is now a rapidly growing market, and the technology developed in this project aims to provide companies with a unique capability to improve their products and to meet the need for truly scalable individualized tutoring.

    The unique innovation of this project is to create a tutoring platform that closes the loop with the student by adapting its teaching strategy to the student?s cognitive state.  To overcome the limitations of current adaptive tutoring systems, this product will measure the student's cognitive workload and engagement, and use this information to adapt aspects of the instructional strategy such as topic selection, content difficulty and interactivity in a closed-loop fashion.  The goals of this project are to modify current brain-wave measurement systems for use by children and young adults, extend associated computational algorithms and validate them to an industry standard, and evaluate the effect of adding brain-based metrics to student models that are at the core of adaptive technologies.  To meet these objectives, we will perform research and development to advance technologies for brain-activity monitoring, and conduct studies with students in grades 6 through 12 who will be tutored in subjects such as math, biology and history while their brain activity is recorded.  The results will be used to determine the effects of using brain activity data to improve the adaptability of computer-based tutors and expand the depth of information available to educational data analytics platforms.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to create a medical device capable of rapidly guiding treatment to stop bleeding in trauma patients. Trauma can affect the body's ability to form clots to stop bleeding. Of the more than 2 million severe cases of trauma in the U.S., approximately one third will develop a condition: trauma-induced coagulopathy (TIC), which increases mortality 4-fold. TIC can be corrected; however, current tests to identify TIC take too long to effectively guide treatment. This leads to sub-optimal care and increased mortality and morbidity. The current standard-of-care to correct TIC is the transfusion of blood products. A patient should only be transfused if necessary because unnecessary transfusions can lead to complications resulting in longer hospital stays and even death. A rapid assay that can evaluate a trauma patient's coagulation status can help guide treatment of their injuries, resulting in improved standard-of-care that can both save lives and healthcare dollars. Yearly trauma rates unfortunately remain stable, and with an addressable market of more than $400M per year in the U.S., the commercial impact for such an assay is significant.

    The proposed project is to develop a rapid assay that provides an individualized assessment of a trauma patient's coagulation status. A significant subset of trauma patients develop impairment to the normal coagulation process as a result of their injuries. Current assays to identify this impairment take too long to effectively guide treatment. Therefore, successful completion of this project will yield a disposable microfluidic card (microcard) that has multiple advantages over current assays, which are slow and non-specific. The microcard will measure clot characteristics currently used by emergency room physicians to guide treatment, but will do so in less than five minutes. This is a critical feature as it quickly guides treatment, meaning that there is time for re-evaluation to determine if treatment is effective. The microcard will also include on-board positive and negative controls that indicate a patient?s individual coagulation profile. This will result in personalized and more accurate treatments that can reduce complications and mortality. The rapid and specific microcard assay will significantly improve care of injured patients while conserving resources and time, ultimately saving money for the U.S. healthcare system.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the assistive use by blind people of thermal imaging. The resulting product provides a person who is blind or visually impaired with the relevant information about the layout of an unfamiliar public space in order to assist blind users in everyday activities. Thermal imaging can differentiate people and objects from their background without the need for complex image analysis. The shape and the temperature of the human body allows the location of people to be easily determined. The societal impact will be assisting users in navigation of complex public spaces. A blind person can use a smartphone?s haptic touchscreen display to examine the thermal image to determine the location of people in front of them. Information about the layout of an unfamiliar public space can be learned from the heat and shape of materials. Examples would be locating vending machines like ATMs and train passes. The market sector for this technology will likely extend beyond assisting blind users, to include additional commercial opportunities as well.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase 2 project will leverage past National Science Foundation Funded research to develop a product that a blind/low vision user can use to receive practical navigation and interaction information about their environment from a multimodal thermogram (thermal image) interface on a smartphone. There are no practical assistive technologies for blind or low vision users that allow them to locate people, objects, and the layout information of their surroundings other than exploring with a cane. This development will address the objective of creating an interface that provides both practical utility and will be accepted by the target demographic of blind users. This project represents an excellent translational path from NSF-sponsored research programs to a product that is built from the ground up on solid theoretical underpinnings and empirical findings from multimodal human information processing. This development will use thermal radiation from people, machines, lighting and heat retention differences in building materials and convert this data into a user interface to facilitate blind navigation and environment interaction. The product resulting will be a multimodal (kinesthetic, vibro-tactile, and auditory) interface for blind users of a smartphone to interpret and gain useful value from thermal image information.

    The broader impact/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in promoting the protection of human health, the environment, and our nation's natural resources by providing new sensors that enable fast, accurate, cost-effective sampling and analysis tools to monitor pollution and exposure. The innovations developed here will allow for the rapid identification and detection of hazardous compounds in water at substantially reduced cost. These technological innovations will translate into triple bottom-line savings of companies by enhancing our ability to protect people and the planet, while simultaneously providing cost and time savings to the business. The technology embodies the concepts of sustainability and ease of use, and will achieve broad commercial appeal by saving businesses money, time, and effort while also giving them more data on potential sources of pollution. Scientifically, this technology will enable more precise assessment of environmental pollution by providing more rapid measurement capability at a larger scale than is currently possible.


    This project will develop an innovative, market-disruptive technology for measuring toxic metals in water. This technology is inexpensive, portable, and does not require any power or external reading equipment. Furthermore, it can be adapted to a wide range of toxic compounds after initial commercialization around metals analysis. The system costs an order of magnitude less than the current "point of need" technologies capable of quantitative determination of toxic metals in water, and two orders of magnitude less than the traditional laboratory tests. Access Sensor Technologies is a new startup, but the core team has a strong track record in the field of microfluidic paper-based analytical devices for environmental analysis where the proposed system represents a major innovation in the field. The proposal has four technical objectives: (1) Expand the palette of applicable chemistry to include additional metals: cadmium, lead, manganese, and both chromium 3+ and 6+; (2) Test the prototype system in a relevant laboratory environment or in a simulated operational environment; (3) Achieve a successful customer-driven demonstration of the system in the field; and (4) Identify key elements of manufacturability that define the roadmap to production of the system at market scale.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes peak demand relief for utilities, reduced
    freezer operating costs for retail stores, and natural refrigerants for regulators. Unfortunately, no state-ofthe-
    art system simultaneously addresses all these issues. Industrial/commercial batteries remain
    unaffordable, refrigeration costs account for 60% of a retail store?s electricity bills and equipment
    manufacturers are only realizing incremental efficiency improvements with new vapor compression
    architectures. This project introduces an energy storage technology, embedded in a natural refrigerant
    cooling cycle, that provides load-shifting services and a 40% reduction in commercial freezer electrical
    purchases. More importantly, it achieves this at a 3-year payback without government incentives using
    natural, near ambient, materials.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will investigate an energy storage
    technique utilizing water as the storage material in a time delayed, freeze-point-suppression refrigeration
    cycle. The project will focus on the internal testing, third party validation and commercial demonstration
    of a 10kWth system. Successful integration within low temperature refrigeration architectures requires
    industrial design focused on skid/waste heat integration, validation testing to inform required part count
    reductions/system revisions and demonstration to monitor, learn and revise the technology in preparation
    for scale up.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to provide a new standard of quantifying touch for industries currently relying on qualitative data from expert sensory panels (the tactile equivalent of professional wine tasters). Advancing the understanding of the role and function of tactile sensing in perception and manipulation is also essential if robots are to behave like humans. Studies have demonstrated that humans who cannot feel due to permanent disease or temporary anesthesia perform poorly in fine manipulation tasks (similar to even the best robotic systems without touch). The research proposed in this project is the next step to bring tactile sensing and sensory-motor intelligence to the next generation of robotics. The successful demonstration of a tactile sensor with perceptual similarity to the human fingertip would mark substantial progress in the field of telemanipulation, bringing the world one step closer to remote haptic perception.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project seeks to develop the world's first standard of human tactile perception. It has been proposed that tactile recognition presents a more difficult problem than vision and hearing, requiring not only intelligent sensory processing, but also intelligent algorithms to select and control movements, which have a tremendous influence on what is sensed. Artificial sensors that mimic the mechanical properties and sensitivity of the human fingertip have not existed until recently. The research proposed herein will test hypotheses that a biologically inspired robotic system can measure properties that correspond to subjective percepts, descriptors and associations that humans use to characterize objects by touch.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to provide a safe and effective cure for fungal
    nail infections. In addition, the technology developed in this project could be
    utilized in other healthcare treatments such as skin and wound disinfection, decontamination
    of teeth and gums (oral hygiene), and the sterilization of medical instruments
    and implanted devices.  Fungal nail infection rates are growing at an estimated
    7% annually following both the general aging of the population and the rise in
    the incidence of diabetes. 50% of elderly over the age of 70 and 30% of all diabetics
    are affected. For many people, their infected nails are painful and embarrassing.
    Worst of all, diabetics with fungal nail infections are at increased risk for
    foot ulcerations, gangrene, and amputation. 38 million Americans suffer from nail
    fungal infections and spend over $3 billion dollars each year on treatments that
    are ineffective and sometimes unsafe. People suffering with nail fungal infections
    express widespread dissatisfaction with the limited success, side effects, high
    cost and inconvenience of current treatments.  \n\nThe proposed project will complete
    prototype development of a novel, safe, and effective treatment option for onychomycosis
    (nail fungal infection).  The medical device will allow a doctor to fumigate the
    infected nail with gas because gas can penetrate the nail and kill the fungus
    where all other treatments cannot reach. The human toe nail lacks a blood supply
    to deliver optimal immune system protection to fight off fungal infections. This
    project will develop a device that converts the air above the surface of the toe
    nail into the same gases used by the immune system to fight infection. Hence,
    the gas treatment would safely mimic the normal blood supply of anti-microbial
    chemicals. This SBIR project will reduce technical development risks, improve
    the device usability by doctors, and establish the manufacturability of the device.
    Device prototypes will be validated in the laboratory and with users (Podiatrists).
    The clinical-ready prototypes developed during this project will be used in future
    clinical trials that will prove the efficacy and safety of the device needed to
    sell the product. The device promises to fulfill the unmet medical need for a
    safe and effective treatment option for the millions of Americans suffering with
    fungal infected nails."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development and commercialization of a new technology for non-invasive preclinical imaging.  This platform technology will be used in studies of disease or in in drug development.  The project will further develop and validate an imaging platform based on three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound, which is a low cost, high-throughput alternative to existing whole-body imaging modalities, and will provide more sensitivity and field of view than current two-dimensional (2D) ultrasound approaches.   The technology developed will reduce costs of whole-body preclinical imaging, and enable access to this technology to smaller research organizations.  Increased availability of a low-cost imaging tool for preclinical disease and drug development studies could accelerate progress in improving human health while reducing cost burdens on life science labs.

    The proposed project addresses the problem that 2D ultrasound is a preferred imaging modality in preclinical studies due to the adequate resolution, high throughput, and low cost; however, it suffers from user variability and inadequate field of view.  The research objectives will be to continue the development and validation of a 3D ultrasound system which overcomes challenges of user variability and inadequate field of view.  Specific technical goals will be to improve both the hardware and software of the system for increased throughput, integrating the system components into a cohesive customer-facing product, and calibrating and validating the system for its intended preclinical imaging application. Expected results will be a novel technology ? an automated 3D preclinical ultrasound system, which will substantially improve the performance and capabilities of preclinical ultrasound imaging, yet will retain the low-cost and high throughput characteristics of ultrasound imaging.  This new technology will fill a need present in nearly every academic research institution as well as pharmaceutical and contract research organizations worldwide.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in the automated manufacture of lightweight high-strength carbon fiber composite materials. Experts agree that composite manufacturers must lead innovations in sustainability, price reduction, and cycle-time reduction to meet end-market needs. The innovations proposed in this project, coupled with Vistex Composites' cutting edge Specialized Elastomeric Tooling process, directly address these needs by significantly advancing the state-of-the-art in composites manufacturing equipment. The prevailing motivation for short automated cycles is posed by the automotive industry, where lightweighting delivers major benefits for fuel consumption but where current processes cannot affordably and quickly produce carbon fiber automotive parts in large numbers. The equipment innovations proposed will not only enhance the automotive market but will have substantial commercial value across all composite markets as they allow the manufacture of equivalent quality products, faster, with less waste, significant energy savings, and at lower cost. Furthermore, the proposed automated process will enable Vistex in its aggressive path towards not only broader adoption of its Specialized Elastomeric Tooling process technology but also broader adoption of composite materials. This will directly drive manufacturing job creation, for Vistex and its customers, as composites displace foreign produced goods.


    This project addresses the design, fabrication, and analysis of an automated composite manufacturing cell using Vistex's patented Specialized Elastomeric Tooling process as the central technology. The standard composite manufacturing process, the autoclave, has long cycle times (hours), requires significant manual labor, and is expensive. Vistex's proposed manufacturing cell addresses these concerns. In the proposal manufacturing cell will be designed and fabricated to make a composite product using Specialized Elastomeric Tooling but where parts (1) can be moved rapidly and accurately using automation, (2) rapidly cured using Specialized Elastomeric Tooling, and (3) rapidly ejected/removed from the tooling, all while creating an equivalent or superior product to with significant cycle time savings over the industry's standard autoclave process. Through the use of material testing, cost analysis, and other metrics, each stage of the proposed manufacturing cell will be benchmarked against industry standard processes. The anticipated result will be a prototype turnkey rapid automated manufacturing cell and commercially usable products for project partners.

    This SBIR Phase II project represents a revolutionary advance in adaptive educational technology systems by using data collected from previous exercises to automatically generate hints and feedback for students. This work addresses the SBIR Educational Technologies and Applications subtopic EA5 - Learning and Assessment by making adaptive learning widely available and by providing tools to assess student performance in order to make interventions as early as possible and help students succeed. While it is well known that adaptive Computer Based Training (CBT) is more efficient and more effective, it has traditionally been cost prohibitive to produce in most domains. By leveraging the latest research in Big Data analytics and Educational Data Mining (EDM), this project will produce adaptive capabilities automatically, dramatically reducing the costs of producing more effective training and making such training widely available. The core customers for this technology will be providers of training systems. This includes publishing organizations, developers of software tools for education, and providers of corporate and government training. Institutions that are struggling to educate students, particularly across STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) fields, will be able to use this technology in their existing teaching systems and thus improve student engagement and performance.

    The final outcome of this project will be an integrated set of software tools that collect data from existing computer/web based training software, and automatically generate adaptive capabilities to create a personalized learning environment for students. It does this by using novel EDM and machine learning techniques to build and organize student and problem models that improve over time as more data is collected. It also provides for the tracking of student progress on specific concepts or skills (knowledge tracing), allowing for easy assessment at any point in time. The system also dynamically selects the students' next problems to maximize student learning and minimize time needed to master a set of skills (problem selection). For complex multi-step problems, this system will provide context-specific, just-in-time hints to help students as they learn. The final product will include data adapters that allow developers of existing software to seamlessly connect with this system. Finally, a main differentiator of this system is the transparent process of data curation and the related visualization tools that expose the problem- and student-model generation process. This combination of human input and machine learning will provide researchers, developers, and educators tools to explore student data and allow for new insights into how students learn.

    is associated with known risks, such as inadvertent extubation, laryngo-tracheal
    trauma, and, most significantly, ventilator-associated pneumonia. Alternatively,
    agitated patients can do physical harm to themselves by dislodging vital life
    support and monitoring devices with excessive musculoskeletal activity. \n\nUndersedation
    and oversedation result in excessive economic burden on the healthcare system.
    The annual cost of oversedation in the US is $400 million, whereas reducing mechanical
    ventilation in oversedated patients by just one day can result in an annual savings
    of $4 billion in the US alone. Current clinical practice in patient critical care
    requires the nursing staff to assess the patient?s agitation and sedation state

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to significantly improve the care of cancer patients by providing an integrated platform for clinical data and image analytics to their care providers for better clinical decision making. Tight integration of clinical data with radiology images will enable evidence-based approaches to be used by care providers in oncology. The tools being developed in this project will enable accelerated transition of comprehensive data-driven cancer research into clinical practice for decision making related to diagnosis and treatment of cancer. Recent trends, such as wide adoption of electronic medical records and radiological images and availability of powerful computing at reasonable prices have made it possible to improve the prognostic and diagnostic power of data, in particular imaging data analysis in healthcare.  The integrated analytics platform being developed will streamline treatment monitoring by imaging and reduce diagnostic errors; hence increasing the quality to cancer care.

    The proposed project aims to develop an integrated, minable, clinical and imaging data analytics platform for oncology. The platform combines recent advances in data mining, context search, image segmentation and deformable registration into an imaging system deployed at the point of care. The diagnostic potential of clinical and image data will be enhanced by the ability to compare lesion characteristics of the current case to a large repository of lesions from other studies with known diagnosis. The proposed search tool will generate patient cohorts with a given set of diagnosis and treatment conditions and present the related images to the diagnostician. Additional technology will locate and track tumors and provide detailed characterization such as size, shape, location and texture with detailed analytics. A large, minable database of segmented tumors and detailed metrics will advance research into identifying ?imaging biomarkers?. The embedded imaging platform will allow clinicians to access these decision support tools across a wide spectrum of devices from powerful personal computers to tablets and other mobile devices.

    and they can face an ever-widening gap to their peers. Formative assessment (FA)
    practices have been well established as effective in closing these gaps and informing

    suggestions. More broadly, the data will yield opportunities to research and model
    student understanding and to analyze the learning process, enabling additional
    research into effective practices for the teaching and learning of mathematics.
    With its strong customer value propositions and innovations that will enable new
    forms of software-enhanced teaching and learning, this project will also create
    significant commercial value within the educational market. \n\nThis project will

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project aims to develop a system to dramatically simplify how course content is shared, discovered, curated and managed in educational institutions. The vast majority of content in educational institutions is in multiple silo-ed repositories. Hence, compliance tracking, aligning curricula with competencies and course authoring are manual and expensive processes. This project aims to unlock these silos and make it simple to search, tag and curate courseware at topic-level across multiple platforms. The technology also extracts student feedback and assessment information and maps it against granular learning objectives to provide new insights to track and improve learning outcomes. By unlocking courseware stuck in silo-ed college systems, this project facilitates a cross-institutional marketplace that enables any institution to share and/or monetize curated high quality content, and conversely have access to curated course packs that may be taught by adjunct faculty, a $2B market opportunity. Simplifying faculty access to Open Educational Resources and curated learning content from other colleges will help drive down student course-pack costs significantly.

    The key technical innovation in this project is seamless extraction of learning content from multiple educational repositories coupled with a syllabus-driven semantically intelligent search and recommendation engine woven into the course curation process. Developing an abstracted mechanism to interface with different types of learning management systems and other repositories, and making it portable without requiring a common content format is a significant innovation. Natural Language Processing techniques combined with curated controlled vocabularies and taxonomies are applied to simplify curation of a course, notably automatic topic identification and instructional tagging. The curation data is leveraged in the semantic search engine to improve recommendation of courseware during course authoring. The goal of the adaptive recommendation engine is to improve discovery and usage of both open educational resources and courseware developed in other colleges, without requiring expensive professional services. Another goal of the project is to extract student feedback seamlessly using IMS defined standards regardless of which learning management system is used to deliver the content. The student feedback, assessment data, grades and other information pulled from various college systems are then correlated to provide rich analytics and visibility of student outcomes and alignment of courseware with competencies.

    in the Common Core Standards, teachers are expected to target students? ability
    to conduct short as well as more sustained research projects. The Internet is
    not only the obvious go-to place for teaching these skills but one of the reasons
    for mandating them. It is the easy access to vast amounts of information that
    has made it possible for everyone to conduct research, analyze data and build

    reliable and catalogued information that can be searched by topic and, in school
    libraries, by reading level. The development of the proposed technology, a personalized

    for learners of all ages to engage in inquiry, it enables differentiated learning
    and gives learners a life-long tool to help them understand and critically engage
    with digital information. The target market is not limited to the U.S. The developed

    sites that are relevant to the curriculum. The developed technology analyzes the
    reading difficulty and thematic content of websites automatically in real time
    search. The purpose of the system is to make adaptive individualized recommendations
    that match the student's reading level and are appropriate for her current familiarity
    with the topic. The patent pending adaptive component is built using machine learning
    and collaborative filtering methods. The resulting research tool, a personalized
    web curator, is based on novel methods for modeling the student's familiarity
    with the topic of web resources. These methods are extended to include novel analysis
    of video content. Unlike other adaptive educational products, the system's adaptive
    recommendations do not rely on obtaining test scores from the user and corresponding
    them to  pre-labeled, leveled data. The complete solution includes an integrated
    gamified experience that helps the students acquire basic and advanced research
    skills and develop the habit of applying them consistently. The project team includes
    educational technology experts from academia and schools and conducts extensive
    studies evaluating learning benefits by the afforded differentiation in instruction,
    including special education programs and English Language Learners."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to accelerate the pace
    of research and development to enable more rapid deployment of technologies
    into commercial / industrial contexts. In many fields, information is expanding at
    such an exponential rate that finding relevant results to technical knowledge
    searches is increasingly difficult. Further, content is expanding so fast that most
    fields are rapidly forming sub-disciplines, leading to the ?silo-ing? of different
    knowledge sub-domains, a clear challenge to both academia and industry. We
    need ever better ways to organize and present information to users. There are
    disadvantages of the current search engines, mostly relating to excessive
    similarity in search results. Further, while these engines present information
    relating to a known search target, they are less effective at presenting
    unexpected results for information that a user has never heard of but that would
    be useful. What is therefore needed is an exploration system giving searchers a
    strong serendipitous element with a maximum likelihood of results from diverse,
    unexpected, and potentially provocative sources. This will break down silos by
    providing a rapid, relevant means for knowledge-transfer between different
    disciplines, fostering interdisciplinary innovation. This system has been designed
    to provide a means for systematic, automated discovery.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project is focused on
    optimizing and scaling a serendipitous document search system for repurposing
    technologies by analogy into lateral fields. Both by sub-parsing discrete content
    into ontologically separable entities, such as capability, characteristic, and
    composition, and by comparatively assessing certain of these attributes between
    such entities, the attribute relatedness of these entities can be used to drive their
    self-assembly into related attribute networks. This approach provides a
    significant value proposition for drug repurposing, which is the current focus of
    this project. To scale the pair-wise comparison and network assembly of millions
    of documents, a map-reduce based text-processing framework will be developed
    so that massively parallel computations can be carried out in a time- and costefficient
    manner. A distributed search engine technology will be deployed to
    enable rapid querying of the emerging document relationship network. A series of
    machine learning algorithms will then be used to determine potentially hidden
    structural architectural features within the document relationship network.
    Machine learning will elucidate the nature of the relationships in drug networks
    through analyses of inter-node relationships and sub-graph motifs (termed
    ?innovation motifs?). Documents including U.S. patents and scientific papers will
    be processed in the system.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is that more patients will benefit from minimally
    invasive surgery, in which operations are completed through tiny incisions.  In
    addition to patient benefits of less postsurgical pain, less scarring, and quicker
    recovery, minimally invasive surgery also reduces healthcare cost due to shorter
    hospital stays and lower risk of post-operative complications. Minimally invasive
    surgery impacts all surgical specialties, including gynecology, general, bariatric,
    urologic, and cardiothoracic. Although more than 1.5 million such procedures are
    performed in the US each year, wider adoption is limited by the high cost of current
    surgical robots, training burden of traditional hand-held instruments, and complexity
    of certain minimally invasive procedures. The technology developed via this project
    will enable surgeons to perform complex minimally invasive procedures such as
    hysterectomy with minimal training and at a fraction of the cost of surgical robots.
    Surgeons will benefit from this ergonomic design that will significantly reduce
    the incidence of workplace related injury associated with many laparoscopic instruments.
    This development effort will lead to a versatile platform technology that can
    impact nearly all kinds of surgeries enabling a wider adoption of minimally invasive
    surgery. \n\nThe proposed project aims to complete the design, development, verification,
    validation, regulatory clearance and commercial launch of a laparoscopic articulating
    needle driver. This novel low-cost minimally invasive surgery technology provides
    enhanced dexterity and intuitive control that is seen only in multi-million dollar
    surgical robots. Minimally invasive surgery is performed through small holes on
    a patient?s body to minimize trauma, blood loss, and recovery time, and generally
    involves suturing, knot-tying, and fine dissection, all of which would benefit
    from enhanced dexterity in the surgical instrument. Currently available low-cost
    mechanical (non-robotic) instruments either lack dexterity or are counter-intuitive
    to operate, resulting in surgeon fatigue and significant training requirements.
    Robotic instruments provide exceptional dexterity and intuitive control, but are
    costly and beyond the reach of many hospitals and patients. The proposal minimally
    invasive surgery technology platform overcomes this affordability versus functionality
    tradeoff via a novel forearm mounted tool configuration and innovations in parallel-kinematic
    virtual center mechanisms that makes the tool input joint coincident with the
    surgeon?s wrist. This results in a natural and intuitive motion transmission from
    the surgeon?s hand to the tool end-effector via a low-cost design that does not
    require any sensors, actuators, or computer-control."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is significant. The proposed technology could drastically improve the overall effectiveness of pest management programs in various agricultural industries. The proposed system not only eliminates one of the most laborious and dreaded activities of manually inspecting insect traps, but also provides unprecedented access to accurate, real-time insect population information to make more effective pest management decisions. This leads to reduced, spatially-restricted pesticide applications, better understanding of insect pest behaviors, and enhanced biological control. The automated trap?s ability to monitor more than one species of insect not only achieves a higher level of efficiency in pest monitoring but also multiplies the technology?s value to the end users. The potential market for the proposed technology is quite broad. In fact, the technology can benefit any industry that requires regular monitoring of insect populations. Furthermore, the proposed technology could be used for various state and federal pest monitoring programs, such as the Slow the Spread (STS) Project administered by USDA to monitor gypsy moths.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project proposes to develop a multi-modal sensor platform for robust detection and classification of multiple insect pest species for automated monitoring of insect populations in production agriculture. The main goal of this project is two-fold: First is to demonstrate that bio-impedance sensor alone provides useful data to classify multiple insect species. A linear support vector machine classifier using mel-frequency cepstral coefficients extracted from bio-impedance data will be implemented on an embedded platform for detection and classification of two insect pest species. These bio-impedance based electronic traps will undergo large-scale field trials and be prepared for full commercialization. The second objective is to develop a multi-modal electronic trap with ultrasound, infrared and bio-impedance sensors that can simultaneously monitor four or more insect pest species. Measurement signals generated by the sensors will be analyzed to determine a set distinct features that can be computed on an embedded platform for real-time processing. These features will then be used in multi-modal sensor fusion algorithms for robust detection and classification. Different sensor fusion strategies will be investigated and the performance of each fusion algorithm will be evaluated both in controlled and field conditions.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project can strongly influence the healthcare system. The technology of the proposed project has the potential to make a broader impact by decreasing the risk of performing the bone graft harvesting procedure compared to current methods and consequently increase the number of surgeons who choose to collect a patient?s own bone graft in lieu of using inferior bone graft alternatives/substitutes. Furthermore, whereas fewer new, inexperienced surgeons are currently being trained to utilize the patient?s own bone graft because of the risks of current harvesting methods, these surgeons may be encouraged to perform the harvesting procedure with the introduction of the proposed concept. The increase in use of the patient?s own bone will benefit patients because of the widely accepted clinical benefits of autogenous bone graft compared to synthetic or exogenous alternative solutions. The proposed technology may also have a significant commercial impact to hospitals because of potential decreases in operating room time and post-operative patient hospitalization time (compared to the standard harvesting procedure) as well as decreased per-procedure product costs (compared to substitute bone graft products).

    The proposed project addresses the important unmet clinical need of enabling orthopaedic surgeons to collect bone graft from the patient?s pelvic bone in a minimally invasive manner without the patient morbidity and added surgical time intrinsic to the current standard bone graft harvesting methods. The research objectives of the proposed project are to explore various design enhancements to the minimum viable product and assess the impact of these changes on the value proposition; and to explore adjustments to the minimum viable product and assess their fit for use in additional surgical procedures not accessible by the minimum viable product. These objectives will be completed by investigating various new product features and manufacturing processes as well as testing these concepts in various pre-clinical settings. This project has strong intellectual merit because this transformative technological concept has the potential to disrupt the current methods that surgeons employ for harvesting bone graft by introducing a novel solution that improves patient outcomes, surgical time, and hospital costs.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is multi-fold: First, the proposed tripolar concentric
    ring electrode and instrumentation for acquiring brain signals, tripolar electroencephalography
    (tEEG), is a platform technology that has a variety of medical and commercial
    applications. By providing significantly clearer brain signals, tEEG will resolve
    conventional EEG?s major drawback of poor signal quality that clinicians and researchers
    have been struggling with for decades. tEEG can advance diagnosis and fill unmet
    clinical and research needs such as detection of biomarkers to quantify various
    neurological disorders. Second, commercially, tEEG can transform the market landscape
    and set a new standard for EEG equipment. The fundamental improvement promised
    by tEEG and its non-invasive nature are particularly appealing. tEEG could greatly
    simplify and advance the diagnosis of a wide spectrum of neurological disorders
    (epilepsy, sleep disorders, stroke, Parkinson?s, Alzheimer?s, etc.) and more effectively
    guide neurosurgical and other medical procedures. Third, the fundamental improvement
    in spatial resolution and artifacts rejection in EEG signals will help advance
    the understanding of brain activity, leading to new discoveries in the research
    of various brain diseases and neurological disorders. \n\nThe proposed project
    aims to develop a portable tripolar concentric ring electrode (TCRE) electroencephalography
    (tEEG) recording system and perform a comprehensive clinical evaluation to demonstrate
    that tEEG can detect certain important brain EEG signals better than conventional
    EEG. EEG is the primary diagnostic tool for epilepsy, the most common serious
    brain disorder worldwide, but misdiagnosis occurs in up to 50% of the patients.
    Artifact contamination seriously hinders the effectiveness of EEG and is a root
    cause of misdiagnosis. tEEG automatically suppresses artifacts and increases the
    interpretability of EEG through two inventions: (1) a transformative electrode
    configuration - the TCRE; and (2) the proprietary tEEG Interface and digitizer.
    The TCRE, tEEG Interface, and digitizer together comprise a complete, Portable
    tEEG system with the data stored and displayed on a laptop. In this project, clinicians
    will evaluate tEEG against conventional EEG in areas such as usability, ability
    to suppress artifacts, and superiority in seizure detection. If successful, tEEG
    would generate intense interest in the field because of the significant clinical
    and research impact. We expect that comparing tEEG and EEG in a clinical setting
    will demonstrate the superiority of tEEG for diagnosing epilepsy."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the development of a cornerstone for reliable electricity and a modernized grid able to evolve alongside emerging customer demands. Reliable electricity is key component of an industrialized market, critical for the information age, and an enabler for non-industrialized regions evolution and eventual world economic contribution.  The societal benefit therefore of GridBridge's commercially feasible Grid Energy Router is colossal, as it is the step-function change required to truly orchestrate a grid to match this era.  This project will enable numerous hindered technologies and scientific understanding related to energy storage, photovoltaic and other renewable generation, as well as electric vehicles and their correlated fast chargers.  Energy savings are also a monumental aspect and are expected to be in the trillions of dollars.  Society needs electricity to maintain civilization and an updated grid is imperative for supplying that electricity to an evolved consumer base.  GridBridge?s Grid Energy Router will be the crucial component for the modernized grid an enabler for numerous complementary technologies.  GridBridge's GER will eventually replace millions of installed legacy grid technologies throughout the world.  Furthermore, the continued GridBridge-ERC relationship establishes FREEDM ERC's commercialization ecosystem, which includes 200 diverse students.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project combines various research aspects to commercialize the company?s third breakthrough product for electric utilities, the Grid Energy Router (GER).  GridBridge?s Grid Energy Router will be cornerstone for an evolved grid that can integrate renewables and storage, offer dynamic efficiency gains, and intelligently route power.  Although there has been early work with power electronics merely focusing in the area of high-voltage conversion, the approaches thus far limit commercialization and manufacturability.  GridBridge will combine over three years of company market research and utility voice of the customer, a unique product roadmap, and cutting edge research in the areas of feature implementation and voltage conversion.  Keeping in mind the end market, electric utility requirements have been incorporated: highly efficient, cost-competitive, manufacturable within a specific market window, and scalable both to high power and high voltage.  This project facilitates a cost-effective and electrically-efficient product design ready for industrialization and ultimately grid integration, while simultaneously incorporating valuable features that justify utility expenditure and meet a market window of need.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase II project will extend the basic science of linear interference delay effect filters, enabling ultra-wideband tunable RF filters for all types of RF receivers and instrumentation. It will also extend the engineering science of implementing such filters as integrated circuits. And, its distortion filtering aspect will enable enable signal agnostic,adaptive cancellation of wideband, and in-band, interference, for anti-jamming applications as well as to enhance signal quality for the consumer.

    The broader impact/commercial potential is that it will help achieve the national goal of expanding access to RF spectrum by maximizing
    spectral efficiency with its continuous tuning. Second, it reduces filter cost and space requirements while increasing reliability by eliminating increasingly complex filter banks. This will result in smaller, cheaper and more dependable phones for consumers, which will help drive industry growth. Third, the results of this project will deliver Smartphone GPS accuracy rivaling commercial units, as well as enabling protection of GPS-dependent infrastructure against inadvertent or intentional disruption. Fourth, it will enable precise, jamming resistant GPS navigation by aerial drones used by first responders, homeland security and the military, helping prevent crashes that place people at risk.

    This SBIR Phase II project will develop software and a system that enables nearly automatic generation and maintenance of a global database of indoor maps through crowdsourcing and data fusion. The current state of the art in indoor mapping relies on a manual labor-intensive process to create and maintain maps as they change over time, which is difficult to scale. A dynamic map-building system will address the challenge of generating and updating key indoor map navigation data. The developed mapping software will use existing embedded Smartphone sensors to discover building features (such as hallways, elevators, exits, and stairwells) and their connectivity as a user walks through a building while carrying a Smartphone running the mapping application.  Additional building signature information is collected as part of the map. The user's location, which is simultaneously being tracked using the same sensors, is used to identify the location of the discovered building features. The map accuracy and completeness will increase as the number of users increase.  This indoor map database will be used for improved indoor location and routing.

    The broader/commercial impact of the mapping software is that it will enable map coverage to increase beyond high use environments such as malls, airports, and museums.  The dynamic map-building system enables maps to be easily extended to include all commercial buildings and to help address the challenge of maintaining and updating indoor map navigation data as they change over time.  The data produced by the system will complement and integrate with indoor map data being made available by leading indoor map suppliers. Indoor maps can be used to power a wide array of applications, and they are clearly essential for making location-based applications work. These applications include consumer applications as well as critical safety applications. Locating people (including children) in emergency situations becomes possible if the software can both calculate their location and show it on a clear map that includes essential floor plan data that makes it easy to reach them. Navigating out of a building in an emergency is possible if the open pathways, stairwells, entrances, and exits are clearly marked on a map.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will perfect a proprietary batch-scale processing technique for fabricating ultrahard and ultrasharp atomic force microscopy (AFM) tips.  The new process involves two steps.  First, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is used to coat the tips with a chemically inert, highly conductive, and extremely hard material. Second, a patented process that we have developed, field directed sputter sharpening (FDSS), sharpens the probe tip to atomic dimensions (1- 4 nm radius of curvature at the tip apex).  Hard, sharp tips are of considerable scientific and market interest because tip geometry and mechanical properties significantly impact the results of AFM measurements. The current project will carry out research to perfect a batch wafer-scale process able to manufacture hundreds of tips at once.  In order to bring the technique to market, the following research and development tasks will be carried out: (a) optimization of process conditions to reproducibly sharpen arrays of AFM probes fabricated on 4-inch wafers, (b) investigation of the ability to coat and sharpen AFM probes with a variety of hard film materials, and (c) assessment of the performance of batch-fabricated probe tips for market-driven probe microscopy applications.

    The broader/commercial impact of the project arises from the development of robust, reproducible, and durable tips that are more resistant to wear (due to the high hardness) and have favorable characteristics for AFM imaging (small radius of curvature, controlled aspect ratio, and electrically conductive). The project will benefit the academic and industrial communities who use scanning probe microscopy imaging. Although AFM and related probe microscopies have many advantages over electron microscopy (e.g., they can be used under ambient conditions and they can be easily interfaced with optical spectroscopy), one significant drawback is that the probe tips have limited lifetimes owing to wear during use. The development and commercial introduction of probe tips that are ultrasharp, very hard, conductive, and relatively inexpensive will significantly enhance the capabilities of AFM and related techniques such as scanning capacitance microscopy (SCM), a technique of great interest to the microelectronics industry because it is useful for the on-board testing of integrated circuits for delay faults. The research will also be of benefit to those who image insulating surfaces such as polymers and other soft materials where static charge build-up limits efficacy, and to those developing multi-tip probe arrays for lithographic and nanomanufacturing applications.

    This project will enable students to learn difficult science concepts using a collaborative gaming approach that aims to significantly increase student engagement and understanding. This game is being developed to improve the instruction of photosynthesis and cell respiration, which are required curriculum for high school students in life science courses. These processes are largely invisible, comprised of a complex and interdependent set of interactions, and difficult to teach. By creating educationally sound interactive tools to undertake complicated science subjects, the project aims to increase secondary student involvement and interest in STEM, and to help build the core scientific knowledge and higher-order thinking skills they will need to address the challenges of the 21st Century. The app content and design is based on evidence-based pedagogical approaches to effective science instruction. Developing a more immersive and practicable learning method upholds the NSF's mission to promote exceptional science education and will help attract and prepare more students for STEM-based careers. This work will provide teachers with an instructional tool that conveys accurate details of chemically-based biological processes, enable them to deliver differentiated instruction to their classes, and ensure that all their students, whatever their level of pre-existing knowledge and ability, are able to meet the prescribed national and state-level life science standards.

    The project proposes to develop and implement a working simulator that produces scientifically accurate output for a virtual lab learning environment, with which students can quickly build practical understanding of the scientific method through trial and error. This enables a) the introduction of legitimate agency into student learning so that their choices drive the learning, b) the generation of meaningful (non-generic) instructional prompts that respond precisely to how each individual interacts with the game, and c) the establishment of a valuable framework for assessing student learning based on their multiple authentic interactions with the simulator. The simulator will represent biological processes using a mathematical model in order to support an arbitrary range of hypotheses. Additional innovations include a) automated tools that differentiate instruction at the classroom level to help teachers address a range of student proficiencies, from remedial to advanced, b) expanded device-to-device student interactions that utilize collaborative assessments and argumentation games, c) app management tools that enable teachers to organize, monitor and assess individual student participation within these collaborative activities, and d) the integration of relevant geohistorical climate data into each player's "reward garden" in order to build aptitude and foster interest in quantitative analysis activities. Classroom testing will be conducted to validate our approach and demonstrate efficacy.

- abstractText: "This project creates an educational, touchscreen-based software that
    translates visual educational content into accessible, multisensory content for
    students with special needs, and particularly those with blindness and visual
    impairments. Consider the challenge in the educational landscape today: schools
    are increasingly adopting digital tools oriented toward creating a more interactive,
    personalized experience for mainstream students, but at the same time, are struggling
    to accommodate their diverse student population, particularly, the 6 million students
    in special education in the U.S. This problem is exaggerated in Science, Technology,
    Engineering, and Math (STEM), where content is often complex and visual. This
    project addresses these challenges, building on what we already know about human
    information processing and haptic interfaces to create software that will automatically
    convert highly visual content into content that can be seen, heard, and felt in
    real-time in class. This project supports NSF?s mission ensuring that inclusion
    of all students is at the forefront of the digital transformation of U.S. classrooms.
    The societal impacts of this work overcome several barriers impeding students
    with special needs from being independent and active contributors in the STEM
    educational experience and ultimately, many STEM professions. ViTAL projects a
    direct, financial return on investment for taxpayers within three years of operations,
    generating both revenue and new jobs, with plans to multiply this growth year
    over year. \n\n\nThe innovation in this project is the creation of methods and
    algorithms for effective translation of visual content into multimodal content,
    appropriately down sampled for the nonvisual sensory channels yet effective in
    conveying the most meaningful information. Such a conversion currently does not
    exist, which results in high overhead costs to create accessible graphics and
    is a major pain point in special education, particularly for individuals with
    visual impairments or blindness. Further, translating graphical content from the
    visual to the multimodal (visual, auditory, and haptic) space is not a straightforward
    conversion due to the limited bandwidth of human touch compared to vision and
    the complexity of features presented in graphical information. This challenge
    is exaggerated when accounting for the varying types of haptic feedback that can
    be provided from varying platforms (Android and iOS). This project addresses these
    challenges, creating a streamlined solution for generating accessible, multisensory
    content, in real-time, on commercial platforms for K-12 classrooms. The outcomes
    of this project will (1) create the algorithms needed to provide an automated
    conversion from the visual to multimodal space, (2) establish a teacher \"dashboard\"
    to streamline the proposed software?s integration in the classroom, and (3) expand
    the software to the iOS market while simultaneously uncovering novel haptic effects
    that leverage Apple?s unique Taptic feedback. Upon completion of the development,
    the software will be beta tested with partnering schools, and then released on
    both Android and iOS markets."

Despite the expectations placed on math teachers by the Common Core State Standards, most are insufficiently prepared to teach students how to become critical thinkers. Much of this problem is due to limited pedagogical skills of teachers in providing adequate problem solving instruction and supports on top of teachers' own limited problem solving skills. This project remedies this with its integrated modules and powerful analytics engine that suggests learning pathways for both expert and novice teachers. They anchor their research in National Council of Teacher's of Mathematics Principles to Action. It will help teachers develop confidence and skills in planning and evaluating their lessons, as well as understanding student misconceptions and intervening in a timely manner. Teachers who approach problem solving with confidence inspire students to approach difficult math tasks the same way. This has great implications for how many students will continue to enroll in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math programs. In addition, the project sets the stage for educators to develop 21st Century skills including critical thinking, communication and collaboration - essential job skills for the young minds they mentor.

    This effort refines and scales up their product, which is a web and mobile application that works seamlessly in conjunction with our current student-facing platform, to provide teachers with timely supports for improving students' problem-solving skills and math communication. This project will deliver professional development continuously and in-context using virtual peers, rich rubrics, interactive tools and actionable data. The analytics engine leverages adaptive learning models in order to build robust modules. The Data Collector Layer will contain interfaces for users to get recommendations, receive user feedback and provide other analysis reports. The Analytics Core Layer will be implemented using a collection of machine learning algorithms. The Service Layer will calculate recommendations based on user profile, user feedback, pre-stored best practices and other use cases. The Persistence Layer will store and get calculated data to recommendation engine's own database. The company plans to conduct several formative evaluations during the course of the project, as well as two pilot studies at the end of each year with a control and experiment group. The results will enable them to determine the effectiveness of ongoing, just-in-time supports for improving teachers' skills and confidence inside and outside the classroom.

    This project will improve the awareness and perception of careers that require science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) competencies. Advocacy is a critical component of career readiness, yet current advocates (parents, guardians, educators, or members of the community) are often not in the position to inform students of potential career options. Career and workforce readiness programs are resource constrained, don't meet the needs of differing learning styles, have inherent bias, and are largely focused on compliance over student competency building. Many underrepresented youths who would otherwise succeed in STEM are often deterred by a lack of role models. If youth understood the opportunities, they could pursue academic pathways to amass skills that better prepare them to enter the workforce. Furthermore, educators need professional learning experiences and access to insights about their students in order to improve STEM teaching and learning. Helping individuals select rewarding and suitable degrees, training, and careers will increase the likelihood of higher job retention. As more individuals are inspired to pursue and stay in STEM, taxpayers will benefit from increased innovation which in turn will provide tax dollars to invest in such things as healthcare, national security, education, or humanitarian assistance.

    The project will address technical challenges of amassing and distributing massive amounts of 3rd party STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) resource data (both structured and unstructured), developing an information management system for educators and families, developing adaptive learning skill modules, advancing a second generation smart recommendation engine based on big data, machine learning and predictive modeling techniques, and performing database mining and creating data visualizations to derive meaningful workforce development insights. In addition, the project will involve controlled experiments and usability tests whereby a large amount of anonymized and aggregated student data and business/education entity feedback will be collected. The ultimate goals of the R&D and experiments are to validate that the resulting application, predictive models, information management practices, advocacy networks, and data visualizations have the desired outcome of boosting immediate and near-term student outcomes regarding STEM career intentions and actions.

    This project will address the need for accessible, creative music education. Over 90% of Americans believe music education is valuable, but very few people ever learn enough to create their own music. Instrument lessons are a great way for some beginners to learn about music; however, instrument lessons are expensive and difficult, and focus on performance and technique at the expense of creativity. This project uses a simple audiovisual composition interface to empower music learners to create their own original music on mobile devices from the very beginning of their music education. By combining this intuitive composition interface with data tracking and analysis, this project creates the opportunity to provide music makers with personalized, adaptive feedback as they compose. Currently, $3 billion are spent each year in the United States on instrument lessons, even though they are unaffordable for many potential customers. By leveraging the proliferation of mobile devices worldwide, this project will deliver an accessible, low-cost digital music education option, creating a new market that includes customers who are currently priced out. Expanding participation in creative music education will increase the quantity and quality of music composed worldwide, while also building a sustainable, revenue-generating business and creating new jobs.

    Through data-driven agile software development, this project will address the need for accessible music education through the creation of a technology platform that delivers adaptive learning to musical beginners. Because the platform upon which this project is built is already empowering the creation of thousands of songs each week and collecting usage data from live users, this project is uniquely positioned to tackle the complex problem of providing algorithmic feedback on creative work at scale. Research and development will proceed in four stages: (1) expanding internal tools to allow for direct analysis of the thousands of songs being created on the platform each week; (2) developing an algorithmic approach to analyzing songs and reporting the results to users; (3) applying analysis to match users with relevant communities and collaborators; and (4) implementing adaptive learning approaches to help users more effectively learn to create music. This staged development process will result in an innovative and highly differentiated technology that enables beginners with no musical experience to compose their own music, and uses data to actively support their individual needs as they learn.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project aims to engineer microbes for the cost-effective production of specialty chemicals. Currently, engineered microbial strains bear mutations that increase the production of chemicals of interest by inhibiting the cell's ability to produce off pathway chemicals. These "loss-of-function" mutations are critical as they effectively channel the cell's metabolic flux toward the product of interest. This both boosts the production efficiency and eases downstream purification by eliminating the accumulation of undesirable but chemically-similar contaminants. Unfortunately, these mutations may also decrease the fitness of the cells and, as a result, the growth media must be supplemented with costly nutrients. Technical research herein will assess the feasibility of applying novel regulated proteolysis technology to simultaneously direct maximal metabolic flux toward the target chemical of interest while avoiding the need to supplement the growth media. If successful, this technology would provide a great cost savings and enable fermentative production to be applied more broadly in the production of specialty chemicals.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to provide a stable and cost-effective fermentative production route to a specialty chemical.  Fermentative production of chemicals offers many advantages over traditional petrochemical or extraction-based production processes.  Petrochemical production maintains the nation?s reliance on an unsustainable feedstock (oil) and also leads to national security issues as the US is largely dependent on foreign oil sources.  Chemical production via extraction from plant materials also has ecological challenges.  The process often uses toxic solvents, and may rely on unsustainable farming practices for many plants that are not traditional food crops.  Engineered microbes fermented on sugar feedstock produced using high-efficiency agricultural practices offer a stable alternative for producing specialty chemicals, both in terms of supply and price.

    The intellectual merit of this proposal is that this program allows highly educated scientists and engineers to acquire real-life research experience and to bring the latest innovative theories and techniques from the academic community o the country?s entrepreneurial technology sector. By working in a cutting-edge laboratory where research and development are accomplished within a framework of expected business outcomes and business constraints, researchers learn to work in multidisciplinary teams and to apply their academic expertise to the important work of product development and application in a globally competitive environment. The small businesses benefit from the fresh insights and most current technological skills and training that the recent postdoctoral students would bring. The program puts those skills and that training to work at creative and inventive research companies which otherwise would not be able to afford such expertise. These pairings would provide active SBIR Phase II companies the opportunity to enhance innovative collaboration, strengthen scientific rigor, and quicken the pace of technological breakthrough. Fellows are also encouraged to publish their work within the overall publishing guidelines set by each participating company.


    The broader impact of this program is to broaden participation of underrepresented groups such as women, African
    Americans, Hispanic Americans, American Indians, and Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders in small high-tech companies supported by the NSF SBIR/STTR program. ASEE has proposed stronger outreach strategies than implemented in the current grant to increase visibility and diversity by reaching out to institutions that supply a high number of candidates from underrepresented demographic groups. ASEE is strengthening its outreach by attending postdoctoral and professional organizational conferences that typically target women and underrepresented groups in STEM fields and by having a proactive presence in social media.

    This project, from the University of Pennsylvania (Penn), extends its I-Corps Site. Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors. The Penn I-Corps Site supports the translation of research from STEM areas into the marketplace by providing educational programming, financial support, and strategic guidance through offering Site e-teams access to commercialization programs at its innovation hub, the Penn Center for Innovation (PCI). The Site employs a structured process for business model validation following the Lean Launchpad methodology. Within the context of technologies arising from STEM research at Penn, the goals of the Site are to train teams consisting of faculty, staff, and students by providing hands-on experiential entrepreneurial education, and to accelerate startup creation at Penn.

    A direct result of the Penn I-Corps Site is hands-on training in the Customer Discover Methodology of faculty and students, applications to the NSF's I-Corp program, validation of market need for team projects, the creation of new startups and, when appropriate, licensing of technologies originating from Penn research. The ultimate goal is to help transition of research to commercialization. Promoting a hands-on experiential approach the Site's activities integrate education and traditional technology transfer. More than 75 teams have already been trained since the Penn Site started operating in the summer of 2015. From these, 32 companies were launched, which have acquired $7.2 million in funding via grant awards and investments, and 39 jobs created.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    This project, from The National Collegiate Inventors and Innovators Alliance, Inc. (VentureWell), coordinates, convenes, and evaluates the National Innovation Network and its Innovation Corps (I-Corps) programs.

    Through this project, VentureWell connects national programs to form the "National Innovation Network" (NIN). This emerging community of innovators represents a key component of NSF's I-Corps programs. With the NIN, NSF accelerates the development of a national innovation ecosystem that reaches deeply and broadly across the country to engage the most creative and consequential research discoveries and talents in the process of entrepreneurship. The NIN is composed of clusters of universities that support the I-Corps  Nodes -- the primary training group for the I-Corps national course teams; the I-Corps Sites -- that include the individual institutions dedicated to spurring on very early stage teams; the Teams -- that focus on market validation of technology innovations; and organizational stakeholders such as mentors who support the teams, and venture development partners such as angel investors, venture capitalists and other types of investors.

    The role of VentureWell in the advancing of the NIN involves seven primary activities:
         1. Commission teaching teams for eleven NSF I-Corps National Team Trainings
         2. Implement I-Corps Faculty Training
         3. Convene an I-Corps Faculty Summit
         4. Design and implement Teaching Assistant Training
         5. Organize and implement the annual National Innovation Network conference that brings together all of the Nodes and Sites
         6. Prepare, disseminate and archive the curriculum and curate best practices for pedagogical improvements
         7. Conduct Ongoing Course Evaluation

    A particular focus of this project is VentureWell's research and assessment of formative and summative evaluation of I-Corps Team experiences in cohorts as well as related dissemination activity. The formative evaluation is designed to understand participants' satisfaction with the cohort and course and perspective on the course environment, to understand the quality of instruction, and to assess knowledge gains. The evaluation involves the administration, response rate monitoring, data collection, and cleaning of four surveys: (i) pre-course, (ii) after kickoff, (iii) after week-3 of course weekly webinars, and (iv) post-course. The summative evaluation is designed to track individual and team outcomes of interest to NSF and assess the impact of the course at approximately one year and 3.5 years after formal participation in the program ends. Finally, dissemination activities are designed to ensure that key program information is shared with appropriate audiences. In addition, VentureWell is creating public-use datasets. These datasets contain de-identified data from the pre-course, post-course and longitudinal outcomes surveys in order to disseminate information about the program to the I-Corps research community and allow others to use these data in their research.

    This project, from Binghamton University, creates an NSF I-Corps Site at this institution.

    NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

    The Binghamton I-Corps Site strengthens the ecosystem at Binghamton University. By integrating existing innovation support programs and technology transfer with entrepreneurship and business incubation services, technologies stemming from faculty research, student ingenuity, and community innovators are evaluated for commercial viability. Experienced technology transfer professionals, technical experts resident in Binghamton's industry-facing centers, and on-staff entrepreneurship and financial advisers recruit teams and promote promising teams into the program.

    Entrepreneurship and engineering faculty, entrepreneurs-in-residence (EIRs), and community coaches and mentors stimulate ideation and team building, and guide the innovators through theory and practice, and, ultimately, the go / no-go decision. By virtue of a rigorous selection process and hands-on training, the teams with customer-validated, technology- and manufacturing-feasible products and services proceed with commercialization with further support from the university, local businesses, and funders, as well as the I-Corps regional and national nodes. The process creates a growing cadre of entrepreneurs who continue to innovate, build businesses, mentor and invest in others, and overall recharge the entrepreneurial ecosystem, making Binghamton and the University a hub for entrepreneurs, investors, and start-up companies.

    The Binghamton I-Corps Site is meant to transform the mindset of University faculty, staff and students, as well as that of community members and leaders by providing a practical, achievable approach to generating new, sustainable ventures built around technologies. Demonstrating this path forward creates positive and powerful relationships between universities, the local business, professional services and investor communities, industry, and government. Generating trust and interactions between academia-private sector-government has ripple effects far beyond the teams going through the program, and propagate a self-sustaining, entrepreneurial ecosystem driven and replenished by new launches. Furthermore, by bringing together entrepreneurs and intrapreneurs, this Site program blurs lines separating big and small business, manufacturing and service industries, academia and the private sector, and spurs efforts towards the common goal of value and job creation through new ventures. Successful launches of companies inspire Binghamton University researchers, students and graduates, and instill optimism about the prospects for creating wealth and fulfilling jobs in Binghamton, or wherever their careers take them throughout the nation.

    Site is a partnership between UNM's two innovation and entrepreneurial units,
    the Innovation Academy (iA) and STC.UNM (STC). The iA provides students with direct
    experience and real-world skills in entrepreneurship, equipping them with the
    requisite proficiency to transition their original ideas into the marketplace.
    iA offers a suite of courses, a scholars project-based program, a minor in innovation,
    and an entrepreneurial literacy program. STC works with entrepreneurial faculty
    and students at UNM to explore new inventions, commercialize technologies, protect
    intellectual property and create start-up companies based on UNM research innovations.
    iA, STC and their programs and services co-locate at the Lobo Rainforest Building,
    a new structure with spaces to accelerate commercialization of intellectual capital
    and generate successful startup companies. NSF I-Corps Site funding leverages
    these innovation and technology transfer services, physical facilities, expert

These two programs are structured to nurture innovator teams using Lean Startup methodology and embody the notion of nurturing innovators both with deep craft and fresh eyes, that is, people with some who have depth of technical expertise as well as those with a fresh perspective on new markets, communication technologies, and consumer concepts. The TechCelerator Program, established in 2011 seeks to accelerate the commercialization of University technology. The Happy Valley Launchbox, created in 2015, is a community-university accelerator that makes extensive use of Lean Startup principles and Design Thinking to help teams bring their ideas into the marketplace. The I-Corps Site program provides funds to teams that are either selected out of one of these programs or have members combined from both programs to support the translation of university technology. The I-Corps Site also engages the broad network of Penn State Innovation hubs across the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

    The outcomes of this project have the potential for significant broader impacts across the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the region. Initial activity focuses on Penn State's main University Park Campus. However, Invent Penn State operates 13 community innovation hubs throughout the State, affiliated with the University's network of Commonwealth campuses. In addition, the Penn State I-Corps Site, in collaboration with the Upstate New York regional I-Corps Node will run summer programs to train leaders from the commonwealth innovation hubs in Lean startup methodology and will engage their promising teams with the Upstate New York (UNY) regional I-Corps Node.

    This project, at the University of Arkansas (UA), creates an I-Corps Site at this institution that involves participants from three UA campuses.

    NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

    The University of Arkansas I-Corps Site, STEP (STEAM Training in Entrepreneurial Practices), builds on university activities and programs that accelerate the commercialization of research by faculty and students. In addition, several UA Research Centers and Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Sites will involve affiliated faculty and students in STEP, a 10-week summer program that is divided into two phases. Phase I, with 15 teams, will focus on instruction in lean startup principles and initial customer discovery interviews. Phase II, with eight teams that receive additional funding, will further develop the most promising business ideas from Phase I. The STEP site will include undergraduate and graduate student teams and faculty from three UA System campuses: the University of Arkansas (UA), the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS), and the University of Arkansas Little Rock (UALR).

    Although the state of Arkansas has made progress in the development of high-growth businesses based on university research outcomes over the past decade, Arkansas continues to be one of the most economically challenged states in the country. The STEP Site encourages researchers to expand their horizons beyond the research they are doing in their labs and consider how the commercialization of their inventions might help promote economic development in the state. In addition to the broader impact of economic development, the STEP Site enables the university to continue its efforts to improve entrepreneurial education for females and underrepresented populations. The university's successful programs for underrepresented high school through graduate students provide a base upon which to build these efforts.

    This project, from Vanderbilt University, creates an NSF I-Corps Site at this institution.

    NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

    Vanderbilt University is investing in building an innovation ecosystem in the Middle Tennessee region. The institution plays a significant role in providing pathways to commercialization for scientific, technology, engineering, and mathematics related research and new startup endeavors. In 2016, Vanderbilt opened its Wond'ry, a new innovation center that serves its entire community of faculty, students, and staff across all academic disciplines. The Wond?ry provides a facility to host and implement the NSF I-Corps Sites program. Since its opening, the Wond'ry inspired innovation and entrepreneurial interest on campus. Combined with the I-Corps Site it becomes the primary pipeline to commercialization for many aspiring innovators and entrepreneurs. Implementing the I-Corps Site at Vanderbilt makes a positive difference by advancing on-campus activities related to scouting, recruiting, educating supporting and contributing to the National Innovation Network. The two primary outcomes of the I-Corps at Vanderbilt Program are growing a talented diverse and globally competitive workforce of STEM and Life Scientists that are trained to think entrepreneurially about discovery, and nuturing and supporting multiple, local teams to transition their new innovations and research into the marketplace.

    The I-Corps Site at Vanderbilt University goals are twofold: 1) to effectively integrate educational opportunities for both graduate and undergraduate students on innovation and entrepreneurship within the traditional STEM and Life science curriculum, and 2) to motivate scientists to engage further in customer discovery as part of their scientific agenda, in the hopes that they will devote their science to addressing and solving problems and real needs in society. The Site at Vanderbilt helps overcome commercialization challenges by incorporating a for-credit course built heavily on the I-Corps curriculum and through the hosting of workshops that provide an introduction to customer discovery and business canvas development. By providing a proven model of success and more cohesive structure, the program ensures that faculty, staff, and students receive the best possible training and are introduced to a vast array of regional and national entrepreneurial resources.

    The I-Corps Site at Vanderbilt trains participants to 1) create solutions to problems with significant positive impact on communities, 2) focus on research with major economic development opportunities, and 3) develop into globally competitive as STEM entrepreneurs. Society will ultimately benefit via an improvement in quality of life through the solutions created to address real-world issues. Middle Tennessee will benefit by having a cohort of well-trained entrepreneurs who, by completing the I-Corps program, will better understand how to identify a viable commercial opportunity and subsequently oversee its successful operational implementation and launch. This will speed the translation of research into new technologies. The subsequent positive economic impacts will occur via these increases in commercialization activities and the number of useful intellectual property disclosures. Subsequent agreements with commercial partners will then grow the region's entrepreneurial ecosystem and empower STEM-entrepreneurs in larger numbers than ever before, thus increasing self confidence in undertaking entrepreneurial endeavors and thus contributing positively to our nation's overall economic growth and vibrancy.

    This project, from the University of Utah, creates an I-Corps Site at this institution.

    NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

    This is a Type II proposal, requesting a "renewal" of funding for an existing I-Corps Site. There are two types of I-Corps Site proposals. Type I proposals are submitted by institutions that have not had prior funding as an I-Corps Site. These proposals may request $100,000 per year for up to five years. Type II proposals are submitted by institutions that have had prior funding as an I-Corps Site. These proposals may request up to $100,000 per year for up to three years.

    The University of Utah I-Corps Site program encourages and assists students and faculty in transitioning research projects to commercialization by providing education, training, resources and networking required for understanding markets, customers, product-market fit and to answer business and/or technology questions. The I-Corps Site program at the University of Utah is currently in its 3rd year and has trained nearly 90 teams and over 150 participants. The program resulted in successful business and technology go/no-go decisions, successful transition to commercialization, and helped advance five technologies to the commercial start-up stage. This extension focuses on refining the curriculum by implementing lessons learned in the first three years of the program, developing new teams and generating more successful transitions, as well as implementing the new financing model that will assure future program sustainability without further government funding.

    The Utah I-Corps Site enhances and builds upon this institution's existing expertise in medical device innovation, commercialization and entrepreneurship. This Site initiated the development of a model of transitioning from research-based technologies to viable commercial products in academic environment that allows the university to expand their innovation programs, provide more impactful resources to faculty and student innovation teams and improve recruitment of underrepresented participants. This extension further generalizes and disseminates the developed curriculum and implements agreements and procedures to assure its future financial sustainability. Partnership networks within the university support underrepresented student and faculty groups and offer the support and resources needed to help such groups thrive and participate in the process and, as the program becomes self-sustaining, will be extended, through internships and special courses to other colleges and local high schools. Thus, the program helps increase the diversity of the regional business environment leading to enhanced growth and economic prosperity for all citizens in the region.

    the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities,
    training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the
    marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen
    innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network
    of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.\n\nThe objective of USC's
    I-Corps Site is to establish a sustainable innovation ecosystem with strong links
    to the local entrepreneurial community. This Site nurtures science, technology,
    engineering and mathematics (STEM) faculty and students who are engaged in projects
    with potential to be transitioned into the marketplace using an integrated entrepreneurship
    curricula, business mentorship, and assignment of resources to early stage discoveries.
    \n\nThe USC I-Corps Site increases awareness and piques the interest of students
    and faculty in technology, expands the engagement of seasoned entrepreneurs and
    investors with researchers, and advances the translation of discoveries to commercial
    applications. The program encompasses three major tasks: (1) enhances entrepreneurial
    training based on the Lean LaunchPad methodology, (2) expands USC's current engagement
    with seasoned entrepreneurs and investors to foster mentoring of junior entrepreneurs.
    This is accomplished through a three-tier strategy that entails one-on-one mentoring,
    an Expert-in-Residence program, student internships in start-ups, and (3) fosters
    outreach activities by disseminating the program curricular activities and best
    practices, and directing strategies to enhance participation of underrepresented
    groups. \n\nThe USC Site program addresses critical barriers to the growth of
    academic entrepreneurship by providing an experiential learning framework with
    an emphasis on customer discovery, networking, and strategic partnerships. The
    tangible outcomes include new opportunities for research funding, strengthened
    academia-industrial connections, and unique exposure of students to real world
    translational research. A secondary outcome of this program is the evolution of
    academic culture that values entrepreneurship and is more proactive in taking
    risk and finding resources to bring ideas to reality. This transition in academic
    culture enhances USC?s efforts to attract students in STEM fields and strengthens
    its role in economic development and job creation.\n\nThe outreach portion of
    this Site is geared toward improving diversity inclusion and enhancing participation
    of underrepresented groups through a wider dissemination of educational activities.
    The broader impacts are four-fold. First, the educational framework offers an
    immersive experience that prepares students to identify and pursue high impact
    opportunities regardless of their vocation. Second, it fosters the innovation
    ecosystem by promoting collaborations between faculty and business partners. This
    stimulates the commercial translation of fundamental research, and exposes the
    local business community to USC's research capacity. Third, it puts in place a
    robust framework for I-Corps team formation to enhance the chance of success of
    USC entrepreneurs in competing for SBIR/STTR and follow-on funding. Fourth, the
    program facilitates the development of a unique model for an entrepreneurial ecosystem
    that combines the best practices from Silicon Valley with the distinct resources
    and assets available in the Southeast."

    This project, from the University at Buffalo (IB), creates an I-Corps Site at this institution.

    NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

    Through their I-Corps Site, UB improves the way technology is commercialized and entrepreneurship is cultivated. UB receives over eighty invention disclosures annually that result in patents, licenses, and the formation of startup companies. To train participant entrepreneurial teams, UB's Business & Entrepreneur Partnerships in the Office of Economic Development (BEP) offers a unique two-phase, resource-efficient training process in the areas of: Customer Discovery, Lean Startup methods, The Business Model Canvas, Developing a prioritized list of testable hypotheses and open questions, and Assessing the strength of an opportunity. Under Phase I, teams receive workshop instruction, work closely with mentors and practice customer discovery. Phase II training integrates intensive customer engagement. UB views the NSF I-Corps Site program as an important way to: 1) perform more robust technical and commercial assessments of new technologies; 2) increase inventors' entrepreneurial skills leading to system-wide culture change; 3) improve the quality of future research proposals; 4) increase commercialization success; 5) prepare inventors and students for success in the I-Corps Node program; 6) pursue SBIR/STTR funding; and 6) provide graduate students and postdocs with a world class experience that will impact their entire careers.

    The UB I-Corps Site program broader impacts are realized through the creation of a network of strategic partnerships between researchers and engaged commercial interests. These relationships increase: industry-sponsored research funding; competitive SBIR/STTR applications; pivotal student experiences; campus-wide, interdisciplinary collaborations; the level of industry mentorship; the number and quality of invention disclosures; participation of 5-10 teams (annually) in the I-Corps Node Program; and overall culture change (innovative, entrepreneurial, collaborative, multidisciplinary). UB's Technology Transfer Office is joined by a number of other units and strategic partners - an inclusivity that extends the impact of the I-Corps Site award across the campus, into the business community, and supports a greater public mission.

    accelerate the commercialization of student, faculty and regional innovations
    into the marketplace, foster and facilitate the exchange of ideas between the
    university and industry and prepare students to become entrepreneurs. This I-Corps
    Sites project: \n1. Supports and expands an entrepreneurial culture in a region
    where entrepreneurs historically have not had significant assistance; \n2. Expands
    opportunities for undergraduate and graduate business and STEM students so that
    they are able obtain hands-on experience in the implementation of product validation
    activities and to engage in real-world STEM-related business projects; \n3. Assists
    STEM faculty to become more comfortable with the practice of marketing their inventions
    by introducing them to the I-Corps theory and practice of the I-Corps methodology;
    \n4. Integrates the I-Corps methodology throughout the UTRGV infrastructure so
    that the university will be able to carry out its mission of \"transforming Texas
    and the nation through the commercialization of university discoveries\".\n\nThere
    are several advantages to having an I-Corps site at UTRGV: being located directly
    on the U-S.-Mexican border, the UTRGV I-Corps is unique in that it the site is
    both binational and bicultural; and, the region that UTRGV serves is one of the
    fastest growing yet impoverished areas in the country. Promoting support for entrepreneurship
    in such a region demonstrates how well the I-Corps methodology works in a historically
    underserved area of the country.\n\nThis project advances the commercialization
    of ideas that come from the STEM colleges and departments within UTRGV by providing
    STEM faculty and students with a methodology to promote their products and ideas
    in the marketplace. It also broadens the participation of normally underrepresented
    Hispanic students in the commercialization process. Ultimately, it will benefit
    the regional economy of deep-south Texas by providing support for start-up businesses
    and it will enhance the research enterprise at UTRGV through the creation of interdisciplinary
    teams."

    of over $600M per year. This research generates over 150 patents each year and
    more than $15M in licensing income annually. A challenge is to transition research
    outcomes to the commercialization stage. The Rutgers University I-Corps Site cultivates
    this pool of early stage ideas and assists with bringing viable concepts through
    the commercialization pathway to the marketplace. Through the I-Corps Site, with
    targeted training and mentoring, I-Corps teams are sourced from the Rutgers Site
    partners. These include the Office of Research Commercialization, educational
    activities ranging from the Collaboration for Technology Entrepreneurship and
    Commercialization (CTEC) and Professional Science Master's (PSM) programs, senior-year
    \"capstone\" engineering design and Honors College programs, and many other feeder
    programs. Mentors are matched to these teams. Inventors benefit from the larger

    the NYCRIN I-Corps Node. \n\nThe Rutgers I-Corps Site provides training, mentoring,
    and access to a large network of business, technical and financial resources.
    The signature activity of this program is that each year, 30 teams participate
    and test the commercial potential of their products with a broad base of consumers.
    This program promotes the value of commercialization to both faculty and students,
    and reinforces the concept that ideas generated by the academic research process
    can have societal and commercial value.\n\nThe Rutgers I-Corps bridges the gap
    between the lab and the marketplace, enhancing the University's commitment to
    fostering economic development across New Jersey and beyond. As the number of
    spin-outs from the university increases, jobs are created and companies hire students
    as interns and graduates as full-time employees. The program's impact goes beyond
    the University by tapping into local business leaders and entrepreneurs for team
    mentorship as well as expanding programs to support the communities around Rutgers
    campuses and to particularly assist underrepresented inventors and business-owners.
    A key area of focus is to increase I-Corps participation from women in STEM and
    ultimately to increase the number of women-owned businesses in the region/state."

    Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the
    National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.\n\nThis
    I-Corps Type II proposal is to continue the existing NSF I-Corps Site program
    at MIT. There are two types of I-Corps Site proposals. Type I proposals are submitted
    by institutions that have not had prior funding as an I-Corps Site. These proposals
    may request $100,000 per year for up to five years. Type II proposals are submitted
    by institutions that have had prior funding as an I-Corps Site. These proposals
    may request up to $100,000 per year for up to three years.\n\nThis Site will continue
    to support MIT researchers that are working on new, innovative and differentiating
    technologies. To date, over seventy teams have participated in the MIT I-Corps
    Site training programs and the total will be well over 100 by the end of the initial
    award. Ten teams have completed the NSF National Team Program and two more have
    been accepted. Collectively, the graduates have received over $8 million in additional
    grants or awards to continue developing their technologies. Six companies have
    submitted SBIR or STTR proposals and four have been awarded so far. Two companies
    were accepted into accelerator programs. The startups have raised over $6.5 million
    in early stage investment and at least twenty-five new jobs have been created.
    Three of the companies have successfully reached commercialization of their publicly
    funded new technologies. Additional outcomes show that participants learn new
    skills both professionally as well as in entrepreneurship. The training contributes
    to their current research and has affected how they will conduct their future
    research by including commercialization potential as part of their planning. Site
    participants benefit from a Team Mentoring approach through a partnership with
    the MIT Venture Mentoring Service that continues beyond their I-Corps training.
    The mentor team framework increases rates of learning and provides continuity
    in nurturing the teams as they advance their ideas.\n\nMIT's activities are likely
    to have broad impact including: encouraging entrepreneurial aspirations and providing
    researchers with training and activities to understand the entrepreneurial process
    allowing them to greatly increase their future prospects while still within the
    academic environment; attracting and supporting a greater number of students,
    faculty and other researchers to actively explore the possibilities of translating
    their research into future commercial applications, ensuring the supply needed
    to fuel the continuous flow of innovations needed by society; and, encouraging
    more women and other underrepresented participants to become engaged and reach
    successful outcomes, serving as visible role models to accelerate the participation
    of others. Finally, through its existing and active Outreach Program, MIT VMS
    will disseminate both the knowledge and practical techniques to its large and
    growing network of universities that have launched mentoring programs based upon
    the VMS model."

    Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities
    whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their
    technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice,
    resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups
    to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants.
    I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute
    to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and
    investors.\n\nThis Site leverages Northeastern's entrepreneurship ecosystem as
    well as that of the larger Boston innovation ecosystem. The foundation for the
    program is a growing body of funded research which offers untapped opportunities
    for commercialization. To facilitate entrepreneurship, Northeastern created a
    series of entrepreneurship courses for undergraduate and graduate students, as
    well as an on-campus incubator feeding ventures into the local investment community.\n\nThe
    Northeastern I-Corps Site program substantially increases both the quantity and
    quality of STEM-related ventures founded through its Site. The I-Corps Site program
    also leverage Northeastern's technology licensing office as well as its Mentor
    and Investors Networks in support of Site teams. There are 280 active individual
    Mentors supporting Northeastern's startups, as well as a variety of angel and
    venture capital investors who regularly assess Northeastern ventures, fifty of
    which have garnered $70 million in venture finance over the past three years.
    \n\nNortheastern University's entrepreneurship system is based on the meta-process
    of Educate, Incubate, and Launch. The I-Corp Site program is a highly focused
    way to a) better recruit a specific graduate, postdoc, and faculty population
    of potential technological entrepreneurs, and b) provide initial entrepreneurship
    and innovation education and training for them. Northeastern is also conducting
    research to more clearly understand the effect of entrepreneurial learning for
    first time entrepreneurs in its own incubator, focusing on the specific areas
    of developing customer insight, new product and service solutions, and business
    models. Several I-Corp ventures are already part of this study.\n\nNortheastern's
    Site goals are to increase the number and quality of technology ventures emerging
    from laboratories and to feed new ventures into the I-Corps National program.
    Another important impact is that I-Corps offers a complementary pathway for early
    stage ventures to pursue initial funding through I-Corps Node and SBIR/STTR programs.
    Another potential impact is the expansion of this program in subsequent years
    to early stage entrepreneurs working in the numerous research environments within
    one mile of the Northeastern campus. These institutions include the medical schools
    and hospitals affiliated with Harvard, Tufts, and Boston University, as well as
    organizations pursuing research in robotics, cybersecurity, and IoT among other
    STEM areas."

    the extension of funding for an existing I-Corps Site that was first funded in
    2013. There are two types of I-Corps Site proposals. Type I proposals are submitted
    by institutions that have not had prior funding as an I-Corps Site. These proposals
    may request $100,000 per year for up to five years. Type II proposals are submitted
    by institutions that have had prior funding as an I-Corps Site. These proposals
    may request up to $100,000 per year for up to three years.\n\nThe Site extensions
    of the California State University (CSU) Program for Education and Research in
    Biotechnology (CSUPERB) for an additional three years builds on experience as
    an I-Corps Site and grows institutional support for life sciences entrepreneurship
    education and technology transfer. The activities involved in this renewal aim
    to smooth the development path for nascent academic entrepreneurs across the CSU.
    Specifically during Phase II, CSU I-Corps is: recruiting biological sciences researchers
    and funding 30 Site Teams annually, providing opportunities to discover biotechnology
    commercialization pathways; building on CSU I-Corps' growing community of life
    science entrepreneurs, alumni, industry experts and campus-based entrepreneurship
    resources to offer tailored advice for research-based ventures; and developing
    a three-part program for nascent biological sciences entrepreneurs to help them
    escape social and cognitive biases, explore venture ideas, assess technologies
    to solve problems, and discover commercialization pathways. The I-Corps Biological
    Sciences Site nurtures CSU researchers so that they gain confidence in their entrepreneurial
    abilities, greater understanding of biotechnology commercialization pathways,
    and a better calibration of their concepts maturity level. \n\nMore than a quarter
    of the CSU STEM baccalaureates are from underrepresented populations - CSU educates
    more Hispanic, African-American, and American Indian undergraduates than all other
    institutions in the state combined. The CSU diverse student population is engaged
    in immersive learning provided by biological sciences research and entrepreneurial
    activities. Employers and investors value creative students who graduate with
    demonstrated accomplishments in team-based research, the ability to solve real-world
    problems, and experience with the unique challenges of biotechnology commercialization.
    CSU I-Corps gives students and faculty access to mentors, sources of capital,
    business expertise, and leadership opportunities."

    This project, at the University of Georgia, creates an I-Corps Site (I-Corps UGA) at that institution. Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

     I-Corps UGA strengthens entrepreneurship and commercialization in the local and regional ecosystem and supports the growth and diversification of Georgia's economy. I-Corps UGA will increase the participation of women and minority students in the resulting innovation network through active collaboration with other local and regional educational institutions serving minority and underrepresented populations. By leveraging, strengthening, and expanding its existing innovation network at the University of GA, the I-Corps UGA enhances the regional and national capacity to support STEM technology development and commercialization. In doing so I-Corps UGA nurtures and supports faculty and student innovators and increases the number of STEM technologies brought to the market. This project demonstrates a strong existing foundation in Business Model Canvas and Lean Startup methodologies. Partnerships with groups such as the Office of Institutional Diversity, Peach State LSAMP, the UGA Women's Leadership Initiative, Terry College's Women's Initiative and with a HBU will lead to broader inclusion of women and underrepresented groups in the program.

    This project, from New York University (NYU), creates an I-Corps Site at this institution. Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

    NYU Tandon School of Engineering (NYU-SoE) Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship (CIE) will "encourage and support diversity in STEM entrepreneurship, among women in particular, by encouraging social entrepreneurship, an approach that has shown to be attractive to women." Using the Lean LaunchPad approach infused with insights into supporting diversity, teams will receive funding for customer discovery, prototyping, and other resources to support commercialization across multiple academic terms. This approach is supported by a strong network of faculty and mentors who have exhibited an excellent record of previous NSF funding and commercialization successes.

    The intellectual merit of this proposal incorporates the proposition that social entrepreneurship is more attractive to underrepresented groups, particularly women. By pursuing avenues that will increase diversity in both STEM and entrepreneurship, through the training, programs, and mentorship of the site, this project may serve as an exemplar for I-Corps nationally.

    This is a proposal from the University of California - Irvine (UC-Irvine) to create an I-Corps Site. NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

    This project, at UC-Irvine, integrates units across campus, focuses on minorities and is likely to have an impact both on the campus and on the regional ecosystem. The Site is built on an already existing 31K sq. ft. collaborative facility, providing a rich environment for commercialization. The I-Corps Site focuses on research strengths such as photonics, nanotechnology, bioengineering, chemistry, medical and life sciences, and transportation. The institution has a large percentage of low-income students, and ranks first among UC institutions for Latino freshman applications, and second in African-American freshman applications. They have a good plan for accessing these students, as well as STEM students. In addition, the Center has helped create businesses with socially conscious missions.

    This project, from the University of California San Diego (UCSD) creates an extension and expansion of their current I-Corps Site. Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

    This Site is the outcome of a Type II proposal from UCSD. There are two types of I-Corps Site proposals: Type I - Type I proposals are submitted by institutions that have not had prior funding as an I-Corps Site; Type II - Type II proposals are submitted by institutions that have had prior funding as an I-Corps Site. The UCSD Type II project proposed continuation and expansion of USCD's existing I-Corps Site, expanding target teams from 30 to 50 annually, integrating collaboration with the existing StartupXX program to nurture female entrepreneurs, adding leadership and team dynamics workshops in collaboration with an existing center on campus, and extending mentoring for I-Corps teams by six months. The Site also builds on a solid track record of success from first round I-Corps Site funding. The extensions to the existing Site are well-conceived, with clearly defined goals, and push the envelope of programming with the requested new funding. Their Site effectively leverages and integrates complementary existing programs, across disciplines, in a strong campus and regional ecosystem.

    This project, from the University of Toledo, will extend and expand their current Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Site. I-Corps Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

    The University of Toledo is repositioning their site program into one that will directly support commercialization of faculty-led research. This is a shift away from the focus of their prior site grant, which supported interdisciplinary, undergraduate-student entrepreneurship. The goal of their new site program is to send teams to the national I-Corps program and prepare them for applying for SBIR and other external funding. They will hold four short courses each year, for 30+ teams. The Site and their personnel have been active nationally, are producing successful teams, are sending teams to the National program, and are launching companies. They have built a Mentor pool to support their teams. They have strong comprehension of the I-Corps program and close collaboration with their regional I-Corps Node. The existence of a Site in Toledo has already had an impact on the region's ecosystem and also at the state level. Leveraging the two I-Corps Sites in Ohio (at Toledo and Akron), the state of Ohio legislated I-Corps@Ohio to expand the support commercialization. The Toledo Site also collaborates with the Rocket Venture Fund and other incubator facilities.

    This project, from the City University of New York (CUNY) creates an I-Corps Site at this institution.  Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

    This particular Site plan is unusual in that it involves spreading the I-Corps program to the Community College (CC) population, as well as to other affiliated institutions. CUNY has a large CC component overall in its student population. Its approach to serving the CC population is creative and potentially adoptable and is likely to impact a large population. Not only will teams be recruited along traditional channels and through community colleges, eight CUNY campuses currently participate in a coordinated undergraduate research program, a source of additional undergraduate teams.

    The institution (as well as its affiliates) are extremely diverse. For example, 60% of the student population is female. A large portion is economically challenged. Other typically underrepresented cohorts in STEM (Hispanics, racial minorities, etc.) also make up a large portion of the student population. Consequently, the expectation is that entrepreneurial culture changes are likely to be profound for this population. Overall, this Site could serve as a national model for inclusion.

    This proposal from the University of Virginia (UVA) creates and I-Corps Site at this institution. Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

    The UVA I-Corps Site is a natural extension of the entrepreneurship efforts already in place on the campus. UVA has an extensive set of offerings for its students to learn about the basics of entrepreneurship. The University also has resources for proof of concept that fund teams building prototypes and testing product market fit. The UVA Site will provide the opportunity for early-stage support to help nascent teams take the first step toward commercialization. The Site will help fill the gap between a potentially marketable idea developed in one of the academic centers on campus and several existing translational funds that can provide more meaningful support for a promising start-up team, such as the Coulter Translational Research Partnership, the Biomedical Innovation Fund, the LaunchPad for Diabetes, and the LVG Seed Fund. The fit of the I-Corps program into the existing ecosystem makes UVA a very strong candidate for an I-Corps site. The project will have predictable broader impacts through its effect on the local and regional ecosystems - enabling the launch of new ventures to create jobs and improve the economy.

    This is a proposal to create an I-Corps Site at the University of California - Santa Cruz (UC-SC). The proposal outlines a focused summer program of eight weeks targeted at the under-represented population of the university. NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

    Particular strengths of the proposal include: offering the I-Corps curriculum during a summer program that is well articulated; targeting under-served students in a region with potential for significant impact; an unusual mix of social, not-for-profit startups with for-profit ones; a strong collaboration with the Bay Area I-Corps Node; the commitment from the university to support the I-Corps focused activities; and, there is likely to be an impact not only on the region but also on the students, 25% of who are Hispanic. This project could potentially serve as a model for others to replicate.

    This project, from Mississippi State University, establishes an I-Corps Site in the institution's Center for Entrepreneurship and Outreach (CEO).  NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. The Mississippi State CEO coordinates the efforts of the Office of Technology Management (OTM) and the E-Center to administer the I-Corps Site project. The goal is to recruit and manage thirty teams a year, with the objective of creating viable businesses based on university research.

    Mississippi State has combined their entrepreneurship center with outreach under an EDA University Center - creating the potential for better than average connections with regional businesses and recruiting representatives of those businesses to participate in the I-Corps Site activities. MS has already solidified some company connections and recruited an advisory board.

    There are clear goals for the Site and Mississippi State University has already started to translate research into businesses. Their existing entrepreneurship program is in line with I-Corps and this grant will help them scale-up those efforts. They have experience collaborating with the Southwest I-Corps Node and plans to continue that collaboration. They have a way to support teams that develop new ideas as well as an I-Corps-centric curriculum in place. They have a robust tracking/assessment plan for the program and the individual teams, an asset to the proposal and will help them to measure the impact of the program.

    The site has the potential to have high in on economically distressed and minority populations.  30% of this institution's entering freshman class and 16% of their faculty belong to minority groups.  In addition there is a program that provides support for veterans starting a business. This is a well-structured and thought out project that contains all of the elements that are needed to support a successful I-Corps Site.  It is clear from data they have provided that a Site at this institution would have a significant impact on the university and the region as well as the faculty and students at this institution.

    This is a strong project based on a history of success and a demonstrated commitment to the I-Corps process. UA is achieving their goals of preparing teams for the National program and/or I-Corps@Ohio; encouraging collaboration and enhancing understanding of innovation and entrepreneurship as evidenced by the number of teams that are completing the Site program; continuing on with additional training and receiving external funding. There is evidence of a strong network of support from the university and community as well as an experienced leadership team and mentor network. UA has a very strong track record of translating innovative ideas into companies, and the system created I-Corps@Ohio, a statewide I-Corps program. Under-represented participants are encouraged through the Jumpstart inclusion program and the UA Site has been particularly successful in including women in their programs.

    This project is a renewal of the Bay Area Regional I-Corps Node to continue creating a robust and broad-based entrepreneurship infrastructure built on the scientific, technology, and engineering strengths as well as the business thought leadership of three globally recognized universities, the University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley), the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), and Stanford University. This I-Corps Node will continue building on its success of applying and disseminating the Lean Launchpad methodology through classes and training for both new trainers and early-stage startups. These startups will drive creation of sustainable, scalable science and technology-based startups with both regional and national impacts. The I-Corps Node also will raise awareness of the value of entrepreneurship among science and engineering faculty and students, using specialized programs to drive forcing mechanisms for collaboration. The success of the I-Corps Node itself will be the subject of continual evaluation and analysis, consistent with Lean LaunchPad principles, to develop and disseminate best practices for this region and the nation. A central focus of the Node's work will be finding more efficient ways of solving the two-sided market of connecting scientific and technical talent with business talent. A key question that will be elucidated by this I-Corps Node's research is whether structured mechanisms or a more organic approach will achieve the most favorable outcomes.

    The partner schools have been key contributors to the National Innovation Network in the development of new curriculum and advanced tools. The Node will continue to disseminate the Lean LaunchPad classes widely throughout the Node via classes like Hacking For Defense at Stanford. The Node will also create specialized programs for government funded research centers within universities and governmental agencies ,such as NSA, with the ultimate goal of financial sustainability. The training products and programs created by the I-Corps Node will have broad impact through their widespread dissemination throughout the Node network and beyond. All activities and programs at the I-Corps Node will facilitate the inclusion of groups from diverse regions, economic backgrounds, and ethnicities.

    This project by the University of Michigan I-Corps Node, one of the founding NSF I-Corps nodes, will expand the founding Node into a comprehensive regional node called I-Corps Midwest. I-Corps Midwest Node brings together the University of Michigan (UM) as the lead institution, and the University of Illinois Urbana Champagne, and Purdue University as partner institutions. This Node is uniquely suited to serve the Midwest entrepreneurial ecosystem by bridging rural communication gaps that typically lead to an uninformed commercial opportunity around research inventions, difficulty in retaining and accessing talent with sufficient breadth of specific and relevant expertise, and instilling customer discovery memory across I-Corps programs allowing entrepreneurial researchers to leverage learning from previous I-Corps teams.

    This project will create mechanisms to overcome the consequences of low ecosystem density by building on the existing partner university collaborations and create an active and cohesive network that leverages their collective commercialization pipeline, previous experiences, and connections. The Node will form a deeper understanding of the individual motivations and experiences of the faculty and students as they participate in I-Corps programs. This knowledge will help to continue driving culture change at these institutions and create the innovation human capital needed to move research ideas forward into the marketplace. The Node will create measurements of network activity and the resulting outcomes will provide information on which methodologies are effective and should be propagated to other regional clusters and the nation. This project builds on the previous four years of work by NSF to create collaborations that are critically important for institutions that are not located in entrepreneurially dense areas to reach and prepare individuals to compete on a national and international level.

    with regional affiliates. The primary institutions of I-Corps South will leverage
    their extensive industry relationships, partnerships, mentors, and funding connections
    to bring economic development through startup formation, workforce development,
    and entrepreneurial education. The Node will serve its region's research universities
    and HBCUs via a robust affiliates program. The I-Corps South Node's research contribution
    will lead to an understanding of how NSF-funded teams can be better supported
    to commercialize inventions, and uncover why some academics choose to become entrepreneurs,
    while others do not participate in commercialization activities. I-Corps South
    is also creating a pilot program to create an intelligent support system for I-Corps
    instructors, built upon IBM's Watson. \n\nThis project's planned activities will
    expand the I-Corps curriculum repertoire for effective entrepreneurship training,
    creating a long-lasting impact on the region's teams and entrepreneurs. Its geographically
    dispersed collaborative network of Sites and affiliates will accelerate the development
    of the South's entrepreneurial ecosystems, and provide for increased partnership
    opportunities between academia and industry. The recruitment of new national I-Corps
    teams will increase the impact of the federally funded research. Finally, its
    focus on underrepresented minorities through programs at HBCUs and in Puerto Rico
    will increase the participation of those individuals in entrepreneurship, improving
    their well-being and inspiring future generations to pursue research and job creation
    activities, a clear and substantial benefit to society."

    their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. \n\nI-Corps
    Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the
    National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.\n\nThe
    RPI I-Corps Site includes participation from students and faculty from the Accelerate518
    institutions: Siena College, Skidmore College, Albany Law School and Albany Medical
    College. Accelerate518 is a consortium of regional universities with the common
    goal of teaching experiential learning in entrepreneurship and innovation. RPI?s
    I-Corps Site takes advantage of existing Accelerate518 collaborations in the areas
    of co-curricular, curricular, competitions, and research. \n\nRPI brings takes
    advantage of several resources in building their I-Corps Site. The Severino Center
    for Technological Entrepreneurship at RPI has a supports student and faculty teams
    in bringing highly technical solutions to the marketplace. Within RPI, the Center
    for Automated Technology has rapid prototyping capabilities. The Center for Biotechnology
    and Interdisciplinary Studies has resources for biotechnology and medicine innovators.
    And, the Rensselaer Center for Open Source Software is a leader for testing and
    developing software projects. \n\nRPI's I-Corps Site enables increased formalization
    and acceleration of existing programs with a focus on supporting student teams
    directly. Student teams are funded with modest amounts for software for collaboration
    and instruction, infrastructure, transportation and building an MVP to enable
    teams to transition into commercialization or an I-Corps national Team applicant.
    The mentors, expert advice, and networking opportunities are provided by the Accelerate518
    schools for all teams. The I-Corps Site experience directly supports the development
    of formal, active, local innovation ecosystems for faculty and staff that contribute
    to broader national innovation ecosystem, increasing the interest in innovation
    and commercialization as well as increased numbers of educated students in the
    lean startup systems and processes of entrepreneurship.\n\nThe RPI region is experiencing
    growth in a number of high technology areas with Albany, Rensselaer, Saratoga
    and Schenectady counties becoming centers for technology companies and knowledge
    workers. Further strengthening a culture supporting entrepreneurship in the region
    could have a meaningful economic impact and encourage both graduates and recently
    formed companies to stay in the region."

    Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities
    whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their
    technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice,
    resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups

    \nI-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute
    to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and
    investors.\n\nThe NMSU I-Corps Site is housed at NMSU's economic development arm
    Arrowhead Center (Arrowhead). Through the I-Corps Site, Arrowhead created Aggie
    I-Corps, a five-week training program teaching Value Proposition Design and the
    Customer Discovery process. Aggie I-Corps provides teams with training, resources,
    networking opportunities, and seed funding to move their ventures towards the
    market, along with a range of follow-on funding through local competitions, NSF
    I-Corps, SBIR/STTR, and private investors. Aggie I-Corps is offered three times
    annually and serves a total of 30 teams per year. Teams are identified through
    a competitive application process intended to identify innovations across campus
    in areas typically funded by the NSF.\n\nA novel aspect of the Aggie I-Corps program
    is the focus on Value Proposition Design as opposed to Business Model Design,
    which is the subject of most I-Corps and Lean LaunchPad programs. The purpose
    for the shift to Value Proposition Design is to focus on the two most challenging
    segments of Business Model Canvas: Customer Segments and Value Propositions. The
    core hypothesis is that dedicated training using Value Proposition Canvas will
    serve as a better introduction to entrepreneurship and the Lean LaunchPad methodology
    than starting with the full Business Model Canvas. If successful, the Aggie I-Corps
    could serve as a model for introductory entrepreneurship programs and future I-Corps
    Sites preparing teams for the National I-Corps program.\n\nNMSU and Arrowhead
    have been growing a culture of innovation and entrepreneurship on campus, particularly
    through their Studio G, NMSU/Arrowhead's student business accelerator. In the
    past two years, 80 new member startups were added, involving over 150 student
    entrepreneurs. This rapid growth signifies a large demand for entrepreneurship
    training at NMSU. Aggie I-Corps is an opportunity to build on this current momentum
    and offer student entrepreneurs dedicated training and support to pursue their
    own startups. Aggie I-Corps offers the initial capital for participants to pursue
    their projects to the point of raising additional funding by leveraging the training
    and market research gained through the program. Aggie I-Corps positions STEM-based
    entrepreneurs to win follow-on funding through local competitions, federal funding
    applications and private investment solicitations. \n\nAggie I-Corps is having
    a significant impact on the improvement of the culture of entrepreneurship and
    innovation at NMSU, which yields dividends beyond the training and funding of
    Aggie I-Corps participants. The impact goes beyond the university and contributes
    to the regional ecosystem of entrepreneurship."

    Hampshire (UNH).\n\nNSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities
    established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple,
    local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites
    provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training
    and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace
    or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. \n\nUNH's I-Corps Site enables faculty
    researchers and trainees to explore the commercial potential of their discoveries.
    The application of the Lean Launchpad (LLP) curriculum, intellectual networking
    events, access to business and scientific mentors, and funding mechanisms help
    participants in identifying the critical path to commercialization and ways to
    reach the market with innovative ideas more efficiently. UNH Innovation, which
    is the unit primarily responsible for entrepreneurial activities and technology
    commercialization at UNH, hosts the I-Corps Site.\n\nUNH's existing commercialization
    infrastructure is coordinated to increase the likelihood that research can be
    quickly exposed to the I-Corps program. At least 30 I-Corps Teams are trained
    each year and participate in the UNH Flywheel process. Highlights of this innovative
    process include:\n   (1) Exposure to a four-week Lean Launch Pad (LLP) course
    focusing on customer discovery and value proposition; \n   (2) A 10-week LLP course
    with exposure to the entire business model canvas; \n   (3) A demo day to showcase
    ideas; and \n   (4) Twice-yearly Sandpits, where multiple subject matter experts
    are invited to an open discussion on a general topic to promote interdisciplinary
    and trans-disciplinary conversations. \nPromising projects are connected to business
    mentors, are eligible for new translational funding, and are provided access to
    local incubator and angel/venture capital networks to accelerate market entry
    of ideas.\n\nImplementation of this I-Corp Site constitutes a redesign of the
    ecosystem in such a way as to increase interdisciplinary and trans-disciplinary
    collaboration throughout UNH's $110MM research portfolio, and develop connections
    to available resources necessary to ensure that discoveries fulfill their economic
    and social potential. \n\nTo assess the impact of this redesign, this proposal
    contains an innovative approach to program assessment. While tracking well-established
    metrics such as invention disclosures, licenses, and startup activity, UNH also
    tracks qualitative and social network measures to help assess deeper changes in
    UNH?s innovation ecosystem. This more robust measurement approach not only assists
    in future improvements in UNH's innovation ecosystem, but also increases the scalability
    and transferability of lessons learned and insights gained at UNH?' I-Corps Site
    to the national innovation network.\n\nThe UNH Site impacts transcend exposure
    to and access by faculty and students to LLP coursework.  Startup formation and
    job creation are expanded as a direct result of UNH research and an improved culture
    of commercialization on campus. The UNH Flywheel process (1) exposes the regional
    and national business communities to UNH?s research capacity, (2) increases research
    collaborations between faculty and industry; and (3) improves connections between
    graduate students and the local business community. The program works with existing
    organizations on campus like the Society for Women Engineers, Luna Cats, UNH ADVANCE,
    UNH chapter of the National Society of Black Engineers, and the Associate Vice
    President for Community, Equity, and Diversity to ensure recruitment and enrollment
    for programs is well advertised and broadens the participation of underrepresented
    cohorts in commercialization."

    at the University of New Hampshire'
- abstractText: "This project, from Dartmouth College, creates an Innovation Corps
    Site.\n\nNSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established
    at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams
    to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure,
    advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable
    groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps
    Team applicants. \nI-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally
    and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs
    and investors.\n\nDartmouth's I-Corps Site provides intensive entrepreneurial
    training following the Lean LaunchPad curriculum and resources for customer discovery
    and market need analysis to 90-112 teams of students, faculty, researchers, and
    mentors.  The program bridges campus wide research in science, engineering, medicine,
    and student projects, all of which can lead to potential innovations - with Dartmouth's
    suite of entrepreneurial services offered through its Office of Entrepreneurship
    and Technology Transfer (OETT). \n\nThe intellectual merit of Dartmouth's I-Corps
    Site is the creation of a consistent curriculum that helps scientists, engineers,
    and students frame their discoveries in the context of how they can be used outside
    of the academic institution. The program helps a nascent entrepreneurs to place
    their discovery into one of three categories: continued academic exploration,
    pursuit of its use within the market discovered through program participation,
    or reevaluation with the intent of determining whether a market and need exists
    in a completely different area. \n\nThe objective of the Dartmouth I-Corps Site
    is to engage and equip more students and researchers at all levels - undergraduate,
    graduate, post-doctoral, and faculty - to move their discoveries out of academia
    and into the marketplace. Dartmouth I-Corps Lean LaunchPad workshops are held
    twice annually during Dartmouth's interim periods in December and June.  Using
    the workshops as a springboard and seed funding from the grant, teams perform
    customer discovery, form a value proposition, and determine market need and size
    beginning with the workshop and for a three-month period following the workshop.
    After completing the program, participants are prepared to either rethink their
    discovery or move forward with commercialization. If a team concludes that a discovery
    has commercial value, the team will be well positioned to take advantage of the
    support of the OETT, the NSF I-Corps program, Dartmouth's alumni support network,
    local angel investors, and other organizations.\n\nBroader Impacts: \nThe broader
    impacts of this program lie in its objective to create a campus environment that
    fosters innovation and produces graduates who understand and can engage in defining
    value and identifying need as they launch their careers. Dartmouth's enrollment
    of underrepresented minorities and women in its undergraduate and graduate STEM
    programs significantly exceed national averages; women represent 42% and 48%,
    respectively, of the current senior and junior engineering classes, and 30% of
    declared Computer Science majors. Sciences consistently enroll approximately 50%
    women. The engineering school's first-of-its-kind Ph.D. Innovation program, established
    in 2008, has graduated 30% women or underrepresented minorities. Feeders into
    Dartmouth's I-Corps Sites program come from courses and research laboratories
    from across Dartmouth's college of Arts & Sciences and three professional schools
    and all levels and engage these traditionally underrepresented populations in
    innovation as a natural outcome of the project activities. In order to broaden
    impact to the years beyond the I-Corps grant, investigators will use project outcomes
    to seek alumni support for offering of the Site curriculum and seed funding programs
    semi-annually."

    ecosystem and entrepreneurial community in the TN region through the delivery
    of the I-Corps curriculum and support to 30+ teams per year. This activity will
    leverage existing partnerships between Tennessee Technological University (TTU),
    ORNL and the Biz Foundry to accelerate commercialization through training, enhanced
    education, and support of innovative research, while capitalizing on the existing
    university research infrastructure and the Launch Tennessee (LaunchTN) accelerator
    network. The TTU Site builds on the existing research experience at TTU by adding
    specific commercialization training and experience for teams that are composed
    of various combinations of students, faculty, members of industry and scientists.
    The TTU I-Corps Site expands the innovation and technical commercialization infrastructure
    at TTU by:\n     1) Building skill sets among students, faculty, engineers and
    community startups, and\n     2) Moving technology from academia, government,
    and industry toward commercialization. \nThis project achieves the goals of the
    Innovation Corps Sites Program by facilitating the translation of research, encouraging
    collaboration between academia and industry, and training students to understand
    innovation and entrepreneurship (I&E). This funding allows TTU to support teams
    whose projects are likely candidates for commercialization.\n\nThe innovation
    Site at TTU is built around the national I-Corps model, and its focused training
    experience, and consists of three stages to recruit, immerse and support technical
    entrepreneurs in the innovation and entrepreneurship lifecycle. The stages are:\n
    \    1) Team origination and recruitment \n     2) Formal I-Corps training\n     3)
    Post-training support\nThese stages are designed to improve the pathway to successful
    commercialization and develop the participants as better innovators and contributors
    to the NSF I-Corps network. \n\nTennessee (TN) state entrepreneurial startups,
    as exemplified by SBIR/STTR funding, fall in the 3rd quartile ranking with a 37%
    decrease in the past two decades. Until recently, most TN entrepreneurs have had
    limited or no access to training or opportunities to grow their startup. The TTU
    Site participates in and contributes to the broader knowledge of entrepreneurship
    research and its impact on engineering education and adds to the database of innovators
    in the NSF I-Corps network. In particular, this Site aids in understanding the
    role of entrepreneurship and innovation engineering education and its potential
    impact on: critical thinking; the network of emerging entrepreneurs and mentors;
    and, the addition of business students into the I-Corps model. The Site will investigate
    the early implementation of a quantitative, nationalized assessment model, based
    on the existing Critical Thinking Assessment (CAT) tool, appropriate for the I-Corps
    model that could be extended to train the larger innovation community."

    across the entire organization.\n\nThe main objectives of Pitt I-Corps include
    the following:\n-Increase the number of entrepreneurial minded individuals by
    education, training and outreach to disciplines and individuals underrepresented
    in current commercialization processes;\n-Enhance a recently deployed commercialization
    process focused on supplementing viable innovations from the laboratory with key
    steps required to move them to the market; and\n-Improve connection to the regional
    entrepreneurial ecosystem for enhanced integration of Pitt opportunities into
    the local early-stage environment and similar networks beyond Pittsburgh.\n\nPitt
    Ventures is a new multi-step program that was created in the Innovation Institute
    to provide an experiential learning program enhancing the rate of commercial outcomes
    of Pitt discoveries. It is a lean launchpad engaging faculty, students, and local
    mentors in idea discovery and entrepreneurship as a means of turning concepts
    into products.\n\nThrough support provided in an I-Corps program, Pitt Ventures
    will be enhanced through a focus on disciplines and individuals that have been
    underrepresented in current innovation activities. With this outreach, the breadth
    of commercialized University innovations will be increased as its pipeline will
    contain a more diversified set of opportunities from a broader group of individuals.
    \ \n\nGiven Pitt's collection of resources and opportunities, Pitt I-Corps will
    play an important role in strengthening the entrepreneurial ecosystem in the Mid-West
    by providing more inventions for the region to work on. Through enhanced engagement
    with this network, the University will be better positioned to utilize the set
    of capabilities resident in the region that can help to convert Pitt ideas to
    marketed products. As such, the proposed I-Corps effort will aid the University
    in more effectively converting intellectual value conceived by its innovators
    into economic value realized through commercialization. The end result is more
    new job creation, increased local investment, enhanced economic growth and more
    products benefiting society reaching the market."

    potential customers and product-market fit. \n\nNJIT's support for entrepreneurs
    has four main anchors: the Enterprise Development Center, a 100,000-sq.-foot high
    technology and life sciences business incubator; the newly established NJ Innovation
    Institute; the NJ Innovation Acceleration Center, an initiative of School of Management
    and the Office of Technology Development; and the NJIT Undergraduate Research
    and Innovation initiative where students form interdisciplinary teams and participate
    in experiential research activities that can solve societal problems.  An NSF
    I-Corps Site at NJIT will help bridge one of the roadblocks to the commercialization
    of research by providing funds for the development of risky early-stage prototypes.
    Faculty/Student teams seeking financial support will be required to participate
    in Lean Startup training and entrepreneurial networking that will help them to
    transition from researchers to potential innovators and entrepreneurs. \n\nAn
    NSF I-Corps Site at NJIT will establish a robust pathway to market for original
    research and new technologies by cross-fertilizing academic, entrepreneurial,
    and corporate participation. The grant will further enhance NJIT's relationship
    with the entrepreneurial and corporate communities as we bring community members
    onto campus as mentors for the I-Corps Site teams. \n\nAn I-Corps Site at NJIT
    will create pathway for underrepresented teams to participate in the NSF I-Corps
    program and support the mission of promoting science and technology to advance
    the national health. By combining academic research activities with commercialization
    activities, the I-Corp Site at NJIT will foster experiential teaching, training,
    and learning for students and faculty. Students and faculty who learn to discover
    the path to commercialization will be able to view research discoveries with greater
    understanding.\n\nThe Kauffman Foundation has recognized that minorities are underrepresented
    among entrepreneurs. All entrepreneurs face resource constraints but the barriers
    to entrepreneurship may be insurmountable for economically disadvantaged students
    and students who don't have a strong network from which to derive resources. An
    NSF I-Corp Site at NJIT will draw students from one of the most diverse campuses
    within the US and will provide early stage funding to women, minorities, and economically
    disadvantaged participants on a meritocratic basis. \n\nLeveling the playing field
    will broaden participation from underrepresented groups and create a new class
    of technology entrepreneurs and will benefit society by helping to move ideas
    out of academic silos. Nearly all net new job growth in the US has come from the
    formation of new companies and the subset of new companies that have grown most
    rapidly has been technology-based companies, the sorts of technology startups
    that would be fostered at NJIT."

    at Charlotte creates an I-Corps Site.\n\nNSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites
    are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture
    and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into
    the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities,
    training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the
    marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen
    innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network
    of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.\n\nThe UNC Charlotte I-Corp
    Site, the Ventureprise Charlotte Launch Program, enables a substantial expansion
    of faculty and student customer discovery and startup participation by building
    upon programs and resources that are underway at the University. UNC Charlotte,
    through its Charlotte Research Institute and Ventureprise organizations, offers
    an integrated series of programs that directly address early idea identification,
    customer discovery, startup and growth stage guidance. \n\nThe I-Corps Site funding
    at UNC improves visibility of entrepreneurship, incent broad student and faculty
    participation, and drives commercialization opportunities that leverage the University's
    major investment in innovation and entrepreneurship personnel and infrastructure.
    \ The Ventureprise Charlotte Launch Program is likely to yield insights into best
    practices applicable to a public university with a diverse student population
    that includes many first generation college students. The program operates in
    a region with strong corporate operations and modest venture capital presence
    and is designed to engage corporate partners in team evaluation and guidance.
    \n\nBroader Impacts:\nUNC Charlotte serves more than 26,000 students with a substantial
    population of underrepresented minorities (23% African-American and Hispanic)
    and numerous students from modest economic circumstances. The UNC I-Corps Site
    focuses on this population and on reducing the barriers to STEM entrepreneurial
    participation by all motivated and qualified UNC Charlotte students.\n\nThe rapidly
    growing Charlotte region with 2.6 million residents and strong corporate presence
    participate in the Ventureprise Charlotte Launch Program through mentor engagement
    and community entrepreneur involvement. This creates linkages between the diverse
    student population and community resources, strengthening student network access.
    The I-Corps evidence-based customer discovery methodologies have broader economic
    impact as they infuse the region's innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystem.
    The I-Corps Site funding increases engagement of University faculty and students
    with corporate innovation executives located in the Carolinas. This program strengthens
    and expands partnerships among the University, industry, and the entrepreneurial
    community. These partnerships directly affect commercialization and are likely
    to lead to additional collaborative research and other positive outcomes."

    or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation
    locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors,
    researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.\n\nThe University of Iowa's (UI) I-Corps
    Site accelerates commercialization of technologies developed by UI faculty, students
    and community-based entrepreneurs and has invested in campus-wide infrastructure
    to foster innovation and technology commercialization. Core university entrepreneurship
    and technology commercialization operating units are closely aligned to ensure
    effective and rapid implementation of the UI I-Corps program. The UI has strong
    working relationships with external stakeholders for identifying experienced entrepreneurial
    leaders and mentors and securing financial capital from angel investors, venture
    capitalists and public sector programs to support UI I-Corps teams. \n\nThe establishment
    of a UI I-Corps program significantly improves the campus' entrepreneurial eco-system
    by providing funding for new strategic investments in entrepreneurship education
    and support while leveraging existing commercialization activities.\n\nAt the
    core of the UI I-Corps program is entrepreneurial training; UI Venture School
    is an entrepreneurial training program based on the LeanLaunch Pad and Business
    Model Canvas. The UI offers 6-8 entrepreneurial educational programs annually,
    serving a minimum of 30 commercialization teams. In addition to training, the
    university launches 1) several business and technical support initiatives for
    I-Corps teams including the Summer Accelerator-a 90-day new venture launch program,
    2) UI ProtoLabs-a prototype development program, 3) UI Ventures-a comprehensive
    technical and business development initiative, 4) UI Mentoring-a mentoring program
    connecting UI faculty and students to entrepreneurs, investors and technical experts,
    and 5) a SBIR/STTR grant development assistance program.  \n\nBroader Impacts:\nThe
    UI I-Corps program incorporates mechanisms that may demonstrate the potential
    for how universities can successfully build a campus-wide, interconnected entrepreneurial
    ecosystem through interdisciplinary education and innovation, collaboration with
    colleges, centers, and research units, and partnerships with the private sector.
    UI I-Corps program is expected to: increase the number of UI startup companies;
    intensify interdisciplinary collaborations among faculty, students, entrepreneurs,
    investors and private sector companies; expand the entrepreneurial management
    talent of UI faculty and student entrepreneurs; and support the development and
    commercialization of new technologies designed to solve significant societal challenges.
    \ \n\nIn addition, female entrepreneurs and female led startup companies is the
    focus of the UI I-Corps project. Startup companies led by female CEOs and CTOs
    represent a small fraction of entrepreneurs. The goal of the BI is to increase
    the number of female entrepreneurs on campus to be equal to their male counterpart
    within 5 years. Key elements of the BI approach include: 1) targeted grant funding
    for Gap and startup activities for female entrepreneurs, 2) one-on-one mentoring
    that pairs successful female entrepreneurs with each new female led startup, 3)
    formal recognition of accomplishments, grants and awards by female entrepreneurs,
    4) bringing successful hi-tech female entrepreneurs to campus for publicized seminars
    and one-on-one sessions, 5) developing a network of female entrepreneurs for support,
    feedback and social connections, and 6) instituting an entrepreneurial leave of
    absence with special emphasis for female entrepreneurs."

    by developing the commercialization and entrepreneurial skills of faculty, postdocs,
    and graduate students through the resources and infrastructure provided by Purdue's
    Burton D. Morgan Center for Entrepreneurship (BDMCE) and their Foundry program.
    These activities are supported through the involvement of key researchers and
    mentors who help create and support I-Corps teams in the areas of biomedical technology
    and engineering technologies. The objectives of Purdue?s Sites include: 1) Increase
    the level of customer development activity by I-Corps Site teams by providing
    support through the BDMCE's Foundry; 2) Develop the commercialization and entrepreneurial
    skills of graduate students in life sciences/health care, engineering technologies

    I-Corps Site serves students and faculty members by providing funds to encourage
    greater technology commercialization activity. Through this project, the BYU I-Corps
    Site brings together and builds on successful programs in three diverse colleges
    and two major entrepreneurial units at BYU: the Rollins Center for Entrepreneurship
    and Technology (CET), and the Technology Transfer Office (TTO). The CET primarily
    addresses student entrepreneurship and the TTO primarily addresses faculty technology
    commercialization needs. \n\nBy providing specifically targeted commercialization
    funds, this I-Corps Site program builds bridges that attract and stimulate both
    faculty and student entrepreneurial activity. Approximately 30 teams each year
    receive I-Corps funds to explore technology commercialization opportunities at
    BYU. Expected outcomes include  (1) formation of startup ventures with students
    as major players, (2) creation of scaling plans suitable for presentation to seed-stage
    investors, (3) increased participation by BYU students in the commercialization
    of faculty-generated IP, and (4) increased participation of women and underrepresented
    participants in BYU student entrepreneurship activities.  \n\nBroader Impacts:\nThis
    program advances knowledge by studying best practices in university-centered technology
    commercialization processes, learning how to better incentivize students and faculty
    at BYU to participate in these processes, and tracking weaknesses in student teams
    to learn how best to blend student energy and creativity with faculty expertise
    and external mentoring. By engaging student teams in the technology commercialization
    process, so they build scalable new ventures, this program will directly create
    greater economic activity, particularly in the inter-mountain west region of the
    USA. This will result in increased job creation along with the other normal outcomes
    of increased economic activity. \n\nThis program will also reach out to women

- abstractText: "Intellectual Merit:\nThis is a proposal from the University of Pennsylvania
    to establish an Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Site at its commercialization hub,
    the Penn Center for Innovation (PCI). The Penn I-Corps Site will support translation
    of research from STEM areas into the marketplace by providing educational programming,
    financial support and strategic guidance through offering Site E-teams access
    to commercialization programs at PCI and a new entrepreneurial curriculum, as
    well as guidance by the Wharton Small Business Development Center.  \n\nNSF Innovation
    Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose
    purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology
    concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources,
    networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition
    their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. \n\nA
    typical I-Corps Site is funded for approximately $100,000 per year for up to three
    years. The Site funding is used to by academic institutions to catalyze teams
    (with amounts ranging from $1,000 to $3,000) whose technology concepts are likely
    candidates for commercialization. The make-up of teams at the Sites is modeled
    after the composition of I-Corps Teams, and education at the Sites shares the
    principles of the I-Corps Curriculum. With the support and mentorship of the Sites,
    the teams will learn first-hand about entrepreneurship and explore the transition
    of their ideas, devices, processes or other intellectual activities into the marketplace.\n\nI-Corps
    Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the
    National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.
    The Penn Site will employ a structured process for business model validation following
    the Lean Launchpad methodology. Within the context of technologies arising from
    STEM research at Penn, the goals of the Site are to expand PCI?s start-up creation
    services to teams involving faculty and students, provide hands-on experiential
    entrepreneurial education, and accelerate startup-creation at Penn. This project
    will provide a commercialization path for Penn?s educational entrepreneurial activities
    in STEM by expanding PCI?s company formation for faculty/student teams in STEM
    and by adding an entrepreneurial component to PCI?s educational programs.  \n\nBroader
    Impacts:\nA direct result of the PCI-ICS will be hands-on training in the Customer
    Discover Methodology (Blank, 2012) of 90+ faculty and students, creation of business
    plans and pitches suitable to present to partners and investors, the creation
    of new start-ups and, when appropriate, licensing of technologies originating
    from Penn research.  The ultimate goal is to help transition of research to commercialization,
    while integrating education and traditional technology transfer activities by
    promoting a hands-on experiential approach to development of startup ideas. This
    will be accomplished by establishing a framework that acts as a bridge between
    educational coursework and PCI?s company formation programs.  \n\nThe PCI Site
    will help spawn faculty and students trained in fundamental aspects of entrepreneurism.
    A collaboration with the Wharton-SBDC will have the dual impact of providing business
    guidance to entrepreneurs in STEM and exposing business students to STEM areas
    of research. By connecting Penn nascent entrepreneurs with the PCI?s network of
    entrepreneurs, investors, and advisors as well as with the Ben Franklin Technology
    Partners Southeastern Pennsylvania Economic Development Agency and the Mayor of
    the City of Philadelphia, the Penn I-Corps site may be an important contributor
    to the development of dynamic entrepreneurial ecosystem in the region."

    This project establishes an I-Corps Node that is focused on promoting innovation in the Southwest region of the United States (the Southwest Alliance for Entrepreneurial Innovation Node - "SAEIN"). SAEIN efforts will leverage the combined entrepreneurial experience and extensive research capabilities of three lead research institutions: The University of Texas at Austin (UT Austin), Texas A&M University (TAMU), and Rice University (Rice). Geographically, SAEIN will serve an area of more than 268,000 square miles and help foster the implementation of I-Corps methodologies across a collaborative group of more than 30 institutions of higher learning. SAEIN will specifically engage numerous Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) to implement the I-Corps curriculum and methods as both a standard for entrepreneurial training and a mechanism to broaden participation in STEM fields. SAEIN has the potential to introduce NSF I-Corps curriculum to more than 710,000 community college students and almost 4.8 million K-12 students in the state.

    SAEIN will engage the use of I-Corps methodology throughout entrepreneurship-focused entities and events, including regional academic incubators, the Small Business Development Centers, high profile business plan competitions, and the international South by Southwest (SXSW) event. SAEIN will augment the NIN capabilities by building on the unique economic strengths, labor characteristics, lean manufacturing capabilities, and the innovation ecosystem found in the Southwest region. The Node will generate tremendous exposure for the I-Corps program nationwide and provide a unique platform for innovation promotion and venture development.

    SAEIN engages a strong alliance of institutions that are already connected by a large volume of NSF-supported research projects. It seeks to advance economic growth goals for the region and nation through a variety of programs and activities that employ the business model canvas and team-based discovery practice to best understand the intellectual property resulting from these projects. SAEIN will study the deployment of I-Corps methodologies into regional community college systems and investigate ways to increase STEM participation and 4-year transfer rates from community colleges through the application of I-Corps. Specific Level 3 research thrusts will explore: 1) Lean LaunchPad research that is targeted at vetting the impact of pivots and customer discovery on entrepreneurial success and scientific outcomes; 2) development of a STEM research canvas model that is focused on producing suitable STEM learning sets focused on K-12 STEM learners (consistent with the Business Model Canvas and I-Corps methodologies); and 3) I-Corps Team Modeling and Development, with a focus on exploring the effectiveness of new teaming models around I-Corps methodologies from different populations (i.e., community colleges, K-12, additional external groups).

    Project Description:
    This effort involves the creation and implementation of an I-Corps Regional Node in DC/MD/VA (DMV) region through a partnership involving the University of Maryland College Park (UMD), the George Washington University (GWU), and Virginia Tech (VT). The proximity of the DMV node to the Washington, DC area's vibrant entrepreneurial R&D ecosystem is providing a valuable set of resources to the national I-Corps network. The node is leveraging the respective strengths of the three institutions to help guide the transition of scientific discoveries into technologies and products that benefit society. It is implementing two initiatives that are specifically designed to increase the success rate of participating teams: (1) establishing a formal DMV I-Corps Mentor Network designed to attract, train, and retain top-notch mentors and (2) offering a post I-Corps Support program to help teams with a series of follow-on activities (e.g., continued customer development, minimum viable product prototyping, technology transfer and licensing, fundraising, legal services, and hiring executive talent). The node is implementing an Online Nodal Network (ONN) that ties together and augments existing tools (e.g., LinkedIn, YouTube, Google Docs, Quora, LaunchPad Central); addressing the needs that are particularly valuable to the nature of I-Corps teams. The ONN aggregates rich content and makes it more readily accessible to the I-Corps user community. It further enables the mentor network to pool and share their expertise with multiple I-Corps teams. In addition, the node is studying the effect of I-Corps training on: (1) any adjustments in orientation toward firm creation, (2) the proportion of teams that reach initial profitability, (3) the time required to reach initial profitability, and (4) the resources expended (time, money) in the start-up process.

    Broader Significance:
    In addition to providing training to NSF team cohorts, the DMV node is managing a Regional DMV I-Corps program that is designed to train an additional 150 teams over a three-year period. Thirty-five of the top two hundred U.S. universities in R&D expenditures are within a 4-hour drive of the DMV node. The node is focusing on attracting teams from these top regional academic institutions, as well as from the many federal and state research labs that are unique to the DMV region (e.g., NASA, NIH, ARPA-E). The node is also engaging underrepresented minority participation and HBCUs through cooperation with the Graduate Degrees for Minorities in Engineering and Science, Inc. (GEM) consortium. It is implementing a GEM-endorsed initiative to increase the awareness of research commercialization opportunities. Small grants are being directed to promising HBCUs' teams in order to provide innovation training. The node is additionally leveraging the DMV's mentor network to support the HBCU teams.

    are submitted by institutions that have not had prior funding as an I-Corps Site.
    These proposals may request $100,000 per year for up to five years. Type II proposals
    are submitted by institutions that have had prior funding as an I-Corps Site.
    These proposals may request up to $100,000 per year for up to three years.\n\nThrough
    their initial Site grant, the University of Chicago served approximately 90 STEM
    teams, including innovative faculty, researchers, and students from the University
    of Chicago community and other Chicagoland institutions. Several of these teams

    labor drew away many of these jobs. Many of ECU's students find a lack of available
    jobs in their home towns once they graduate with newly acquired skills so they
    leave home to find jobs elsewhere. For these reasons, much of ENC has faced declining

    is to embed a strong and pervasive culture of entrepreneurship and innovation
    across the entire campus community. With a rigorous and experiential program of
    study, led by experts, this Site interfaces with other innovation Sites in the
    Midwest and, within five years, is expected to propel the university towards reaching
    its full potential in terms of creating new ventures. This goal is being accomplished
    via a new entrepreneurial ecosystem that effectively integrates several key components
    including a continuum of entrepreneurship options, mentors, funding networks and
    assistance, Angel investors, a \"Startup Factory\" program and space in a new
    Startup Factory Building. \n\nExpectations are that the ISU Site is energizing
    solutions to grand challenges - such as food production to serve a growing global
    population - that require innovative thinking and creativity in agriculture, engineering
    and other disciplines. ISU, a land grant institution steeped in traditions of
    agriculture, contributes a record of entrepreneurial contributions reflecting
    its strengths in engineering, bio-renewables, materials science and agriculture.
    In the long term, the I-Corps site will generate a new body of academics, holistically
    trained as scientists-technologists-entrepreneurs, equipped with knowledge and
    skills to galvanize transformative new solutions to vexing agricultural and other
    global problems that will ensure the robustness and sustainability of the food
    and energy supply chain. Association with other agricultural and engineering schools
    in the Midwest enhances the knowledge base and creates a virtual network of innovators
    and entrepreneurs driving the economy of the entire Midwest region. \n\nThrough
    partnership with the Iowa Economic Development Authority (IEDA), the Iowa Innovation
    Council and the Iowa Innovation Corporation (I-ICorp), novice entrepreneurs from
    the ISU innovation ecosystem connect with the broader network of venture capitalists
    and business leaders in the state; through practical experiential learning modules,
    cohorts collaborate with a diversity of successful real-world entrepreneurial
    businesses (bioscience, information technology, bioenergy etc.) in the Research
    Park as well as the more mature companies (Pioneer-DuPont, Monsanto and John Deere)
    that drive the economic engine of the state; and, the Site training program incorporates
    respect for and inclusiveness of all forms of diversity in the innovation economy."

    This project, from George Washington University, creates an I-Corps Site at this institution. NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

    The George Washington University Office of Innovation and Entrepreneurship (OI&E) collaborates with multiple units on campus to dramatically increase student and faculty teams from the STEM disciplines in OI&E innovation and commercialization activities. There is a strong network of mentors who are key in this process. OI&E developed multiple versions of the Lean Startup curriculum and will continue to do so to meet the special needs of undergraduate students, women, minorities, and veterans in the STEM disciplines. OI&E is also creating courseware in support of experienced entrepreneurs, investors, and business professionals who have not yet learned to apply lean startup methods. Doing so brings value to an entire startup ecosystem that is important to startup success. The broader impacts include spreading entrepreneurial thinking among the faculty, developing a well-trained cadre of mentors and adding to the diversity of the pool of mentors, especially women and veterans. These are important goals in entrepreneurship and commercialization and the project is specific about how this Site will advance these broader impacts.

    teams, but also by helping create a faculty and student population that is familiar
    with the business startup process. It also provides a pathway for underrepresented
    students to participate in STEM-related business startups. \n\nThe Site grant
    provides 90 teams (over a three year period) $3,000 in funding per team along
    with training in the startup process, creating a culture of business startup and
    technology commercialization activity on campus that will remain in place long
    after the three year I-Corp grant is completed. \n\nThe OSU I-Corp Site impact
    includes the creation of STEM-related startups, licensing opportunities, jobs
    in Oklahoma and beyond, and incentives that attract underrepresented student groups
    to participate in the program. Business startups are particularly important for
    Oklahoma because the state has few Fortune 500 companies and other large employers.
    An increase in STEM-related jobs in Oklahoma bolsters the economy and improves
    the educational experiences of the students that are involved, increasing their
    competitiveness not only as STEM students but as citizens of our state and nation."

    Technology Transfer Office (TTO) to facilitate faculty and students to transfer
    STEM research into commercially viable ideas and prototypes. Faculty and students
    are recruited for this Site using pro-active processes such as: visits to classrooms,
    capstone design courses, research projects on campus, undergraduate and graduate
    research displays, individual contacts with faculty with STEM related research
    grants, and invention disclosures. The TTO also helps teams connect with business
    mentors by leveraging current contacts. They also are a resource for finding non-NSF
    funds for innovation-related activities. Faculty from CFE, representing the Colleges
    of Business, Engineering, Medicine and Sustainability, deliver the NSF training
    program in a one-week, intensive boot camp format. \n\nBeyond the prototype stage,
    USF CONNECT, which is the business arm of USF and at the epicenter of Tampa Bay's
    innovation ecosystem, supports the I-Corps teams throughout the business life
    cycle, providing facilities, partners, and resources for business development
    and access to technologies, workforce programs, technology commercialization,
    critical research equipment, and incubator facilities. The I-Corps program results
    in an institutional impact by addressing a crucial gap in the USF innovation ecology
    in creating prototypes and enhancing design. \n\nWith an I-Corps site, the potential
    for increasing STEM technology transfer that feeds Tampa Bay's growing innovation
    ecosystem is high and contributes to transforming the region through high-technology
    startups. USF is an economic anchor for the Tampa Bay region and a node of the
    Florida High Tech Corridor that spans a 23-county region in Florida. Most of the
    state's medical device manufacturing, defense, aerospace, informational technology,
    and life sciences companies reside in this region. \n\nUSF's diverse student population
    are also targeted in the I-Corps Sites program. NSF/USF supports the Bridge to
    the Doctorate and Sloan Minority PhD programs that have enabled USF to be ranked
    as a top-10 producer of minority (African American/Black, Hispanic/Latino) engineering
    doctorates. The I-Corps site also nurtures innovation among students who are military
    veterans, as more than 2,100 veterans and their families are enrolled as students

    and engineering-based assistance to companies with technology needs. This suite
    of programs has been successful in fostering the growth of enterprises, including
    startups. The Stony Brook campus leads SUNY in technology transfer performance
    - invention disclosures, patent applications, issued patents, and executed licenses.
    Its economic development/ industry assistance programs, which assists companies
    of any size at any stage of development, has a track record of promoting company
    growth - more than 3,500 projects, completed with more than 800 companies, have
    generated more than $900 million in corporate revenues. The oldest and largest
    Stony Brook incubator has exited some 80 companies with a 55% success record.\n\nThe
    Stony Brook I-Corps Site will capitalize on the prospective talent within its
    own faculty and student body and the discovery and innovation generated by sponsored
    investments in its research programs. Stony Brook's Site will collaborate with
    the University's academic leadership to focus assets on discovering and nurturing
    a new target, the entrepreneur, and structuring access to assets -  including
    the Long Island REACH Hub - to maximize innovation impact and create a permanent,
    sustainable entrepreneurial pipeline as both beneficiary of and stimulus for a
    larger innovation network.  \n\nAs a region of 2.8M people with a $143B Gross
    Metropolitan Product (2012), Stony Brook's location, Long Island, is larger than
    19 states and a net contributor to New York's fiscal health. Its growth rate,
    however, has lagged the nation since 2010. Strengthening the regional innovation
    ecosystem may have long-term positive economic impacts across the state. Within
    the ecosystem itself, the Stony Brook I-Corps Site will not only transform the
    culture of the Stony Brook campus, creating a permanent vehicle to feed the new
    venture pipeline, which will be strengthened by a synergistic relationship with
    the proposed Long Island REACH Hub, but it will also broaden the impact of the
    established NYCRIN I-Corps Node, in which Stony Brook is a partner, by feeding
    it close to an additional 100 entrepreneurial teams over a three-year period.

    National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.\n\nThis
    I-Corps Site project helps OSU deliver on its mission as a land grant university
    and advance efforts to revitalize an economically depressed Oregon by helping
    multiple local teams transition their ideas to the marketplace. Funds allow OSUAA
    to make specific enhancements to the Accelerator and increase the number of I-Corps
    Site (ICS) teams. The project's three goals include the following: (1) Enhancing
    linkages with the OSU engineering, science, and business disciplines through a
    faculty liaison program in support of Accelerator ICS teams; (2) Creating and
    delivering new course content on personal development, team formation, and dynamics
    to enable high performing ICS teams; and (3) Providing course materials and tracking
    software to enhance the Lean Canvas curriculum delivery and seed funds for development
    of prototypes and minimum viable products.\n\nMany of the emerging companies OSUAA
    supports help address larger societal issues  such as clean energy and expensive
    healthcare devices. OSUAA provides a supportive environment to allow these cutting-edge
    technologies to develop and find commercialization pathways. Ultimately, the OSUAA
    may serve as a viable model to help develop new business and enhanced employment
    outcomes for other rural land grant institutions engaged in similar research activities.
    \ \n\nThe OSUAA framework to advance the commercialization of research will help
    improve the economic climate and development in the largely rural state of Oregon.
    Oregon, particularly in the rural areas, tends to lag the nation in economic prosperity
    and recovery. Through facilitated launch of new startup companies, the OSU system
    may reduce unemployment through the creation of higher-wage positions in development,
    manufacturing and related support roles. Funded investments in ICS teams accelerate
    the transition of research to market by providing stronger curricular components
    and dedicated resources for prototyping. \n\nOSUAA works across all 11 university
    colleges, which allows for students to actively participate in the real-world,
    experiential aspects of moving research to the marketplace. The OSUAA also works
    closely with the four cultural centers on campus to ensure that traditionally
    underrepresented groups know about, have access to, and take advantage of OSUAA's
    learning opportunities."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project lies in three aspects: through a systematic customer discovery process, it enhances the R&D community's understanding of the potentially broad needs and application spaces of the contact-less physiological monitoring. For the robust heart-rate tracking technologies that this I-Corps project is based on, the potential commercial impact includes monitoring drivers' conditions to enhance driving safety, supporting safe and effective athletic/fitness training, offering additional analytics from surveillance video for public safety, and more. The outcome of the I-Corps customer discovery will provide real-world requirements and data to a new round of R&D and enhance the R&D community's scientific and technological understanding.  The I-Corps training and experience will prepare the Team to identify and pave a way to the most effective customer-technology path for commercialization, which will lead to an economic and societal impact.  The training would also provide valuable insights to the Technical Lead and Co-Lead, who as faculty members can potentially incorporate the Lean Startup and entrepreneurial thinking into their future education and mentoring activities. This would extend the benefits to many students in the years to come.

    This I-Corps project builds on the research advances of contact-free sensings, such as through video, to capture the very small color changes of a person's face as his/her heart pumps blood to reach the whole body.  The team has developed a strong expertise to harvest such micro signals under a number of scenarios and motivating applications. From the patent-pending research on which this I-Corps project is based, accurate heart rate detection and tracking have been achieved even under significant motion as users move and lighting conditions change, which is common in real-world use.  The synergy of multiple traditionally separate fields, including image/video processing, computer vision, statistical signal processing and estimation, paved a foundation to address the R&D challenges.  The methodologies learned from the I-Corps program serve as a bridge between the theory and practice of micro signal analytics in the important emerging area of health analytics.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The intellectual merit of this project at Johns Hopkins University (JHU) is that the Johns Hopkins Technology Ventures (JHTV) and its accelerator team, FastForward, will support the commercialization of research and technologies to create an innovation ecosystem at the University, and more broadly, in the Baltimore region. This I-Corps Site award enables JHU to leverage research outcomes by providing teams with an essential stipend for customer discovery and prototyping and the ability to validate and test their hypotheses and confirm through customer discovery whether there is value in their technology in the marketplace. By actually getting out of the lab, researchers gain insights into the mindset of decision makers and the payers who may become their customers. This grant will enable the JHU Site to provide a better learning experience for its participants by providing additional, non-dilutive funds.

    For example, in the fall of 2015, JHU's Short Course cohort focused on life sciences and brought together teams from universities across the city. The focused approach allowed instructors to delve into the unique challenges faced by researchers commercializing technology in the life sciences space including the development of strategic partnerships and the need for greater evidence based research at a time when the life science industry is investing less in research and development and easing away from the risks of basic and translational research.

    The I-Corps Site at JHU fills the fundamental educational disconnect between invention and market that is not found inside a lab or classroom but only through customer interviews. The goal of the JHU I-Corps Site will be to advance the knowledge and understanding of the commercial potential of life and basic science research while providing access to the life science expertise of Johns Hopkins to include translation, partnering, and entrepreneurship for the greater National
    Innovation Network.

    Participants in the JHU Site include teams from other universities especially those with diverse populations such as University of Maryland Baltimore City, Morgan State University, and Coppin State University, fostering collaboration and economic growth in the city and beyond. Over five years, this grant will impact 150 JHU teams and to a minimum 45 non-JHU teams, each comprised of three team members, for a total of at least 585 participants.

    teaching and learning activities for faculty and students in STEM, and by actively
    engaging faculty and students of color in academic entrepreneurship, start-up,
    and commercialization training and customer discovery, the JSU Entrepreneurship
    Center/I-Corps Site plays a major role in broadening the participation of underrepresented
    populations in STEM related entrepreneurial activities. The increased participation
    of faculty of color impacts society and the community in particular by bringing
    to market the products, process, services, and/or tools that are the result of
    research from a diverse pool of scholars and thinkers. The pairing of underrepresented

    advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable
    groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps
    Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally
    and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs
    and investors.\n\nTo help Wisconsin grow its economy, UWM and regional partners
    launched an NSF I-Corps site to enhance technology commercialization in southeastern
    Wisconsin. This site leverages the existing partnerships among five regional universities:
    University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Marquette University, Milwaukee School of Engineering,
    Medical College of Wisconsin, and Concordia University of Wisconsin. Southeastern
    Wisconsin has over 1,200 manufacturing companies with national and international
    markets and partnerships covering the entire globe across most industry segments.
    \n\nBy establishing the site, a robust framework is created for I-Corps team formation
    and development, thereby increasing the volume of commercialization activities
    and success rates in securing resources needed for business formation and development.
    \ The UWM site addresses three important needs of academic institutions and industry
    in Southeastern Wisconsin: (1) a need to increase the activity level related to
    commercialization of applied academic research and faculty/student innovation,
    (2) a need to build an innovation/commercialization network that would provide
    multifaceted support to faculty and/or student ventures, and (3) a need to broaden
    the pool of students and faculty fluent in LLP methodology. \n\nUWM leveraged
    Federal Economic Development Authority support by investing $8M in building the
    Innovation Accelerator at the new UWM Innovation Campus adjacent to the Medical
    College of Wisconsin (MCW), the Blood Research Institute of Wisconsin, two major
    Wisconsin hospitals, and GE Healthcare. The accelerator is used to achieve the
    site's curricular objectives. It satisfies low-resolution and more advanced prototyping
    needs of the teams working in the healthcare domain and provides a focus point
    for collaboration between MCW and UWM. Teams working in the advanced manufacturing
    domain leverage Milwaukee School of Engineering and UWM facilities and resources.
    The Global Water Center provides support for freshwater teams, while the UWM main
    campus is the hub for energy research teams. The UWM Research Foundation manages
    the site and coordinate the network.  \n\nThe broader societal impact of the proposed
    site include an increased volume of innovative technologies and solutions brought
    to consumers to solve problems in healthcare, energy, freshwater and other areas.
    The Site partners with existing outreach programs within member institutions.
    \n\nThe commercial impact of the UWM I-Corps Site will be measured by the number
    of teams and participants going through the LLP process, the number and value
    of submitted federal/state/local grant proposals, the success rate of submitted
    proposals, the capital raised, the number of startups launched, the number of
    technology licenses, and the number of new research collaborations between cohort
    teams and team members - all which benefit the region and the nation."

  title: 'I-Corps Sites: Southeastern Wisconsin - Enhancing Regional Technology Commercialization'
- abstractText: "NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established
    at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams
    to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure,
    advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable
    groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps
    Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally
    and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs
    and investors.\n\nThis Site builds on activities at this institution during the
    past 5-6 years during which the University of Washington (UW) developed an ecosystem
    for technology entrepreneurship that provides integrated resources and also uses
    the business-model canvas as part of the planning around each commercialization
    opportunity. \n\nUW will apply I-Corps Site funding to qualified teams for the
    purpose of initiating and developing specific customer relationships. They will
    solicit Site teams from three overlapping pipelines of emerging start-ups at the
    UW: UW Center for Commercialization; the Buerk Center for Entrepreneurship; and
    the Clean Energy Initiative, with overlapping pipelines of technology start-ups
    and of student-led start-ups. With a Site award, UW addresses customer development
    within the I-Corps framework. \n\nBroader Impacts:\nUW has been actively participating
    in state-level and regional entrepreneurial strategies for the past six years.
    Their involvement in the I-Corps national network expands their coherent effort
    to execute a national strategy. Also, to help drive the regional innovation economy
    around Seattle and the Puget Sound, UW has developed its own ecosystem for technology
    entrepreneurship. An I-Corps Site award will expand participant?s entrepreneurial
    experience, especially for students, by emphasizing the importance of early and
    frequent interactions with potential customers. This would directly improve the
    quality and momentum of the start-ups in UW's pipeline, which translates into
    healthier company starts in Washington State."

    Connecticut (UConn).\n\nNSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities
    established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple,
    local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites
    provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training

    to create Accelerate UConn, an NSF I-Corp Site, to strengthen its existing innovation
    ecosystem with entrepreneurial education, experiential learning and a business
    creation process that is based on the I-Corps model. Accelerate UConn (AU) is
    a joint effort of Technology Acceleration Partners (TAP) ­UConn's technology transfer,
    incubation and commercialization entity -and the Connecticut Center for Entrepreneurship
    and Innovation (CCEI), which is responsible for much of UConn?s internal and external
    entrepreneurial education activities. \n\nAs an NSF I-Corps site, AU will expand
    UConn's community of innovators and entrepreneurs and will aid in the transformation
    of UConn discoveries into products that benefit humanity and add to economic growth.
    \n\nBroader Impacts:\nThe proposed activity may significantly impact the preparedness
    of university talent for roles in technology-based, entrepreneurial enterprises
    and, as such, will be a critical ingredient of the economic success of Connecticut
    and the nation. Connecticut has historically relied on well-established companies
    to support its economy, resulting in a dearth of entrepreneurial talent that has
    lead to a loss of innovative capacity. AU's activities will support the shift
    from dependence on large corporate employers to an entrepreneurially driven economy.
    As more startups begin to flourish as a result of AU's efforts, new jobs will
    be created and the career prospects of  graduates will be strengthened. \n\nOn
    the national level, there is valid concern that losing our standing as the global
    leader in technology will result in economic contraction. AU?s activities may
    counter this trend by teaching university researchers to think beyond traditional
    academic boundaries, thus enabling this group of individuals to remain in science
    by becoming drivers of innovation within technology-based, entrepreneurial companies,
    which they help to create."

    ideas at The University of Alabama. The Site nurtures science, technology, engineering
    and mathematics (STEM) faculty and students, with projects originating from student
    work, research, institutional or industrial projects, and creates a local innovation
    ecosystem that contributes to a larger, national network of mentors, researchers,

    of Technology, The University of Alabama Site will improve and expand AIME's current
    innovation curriculum and training programs. Site funding offers entrepreneurial
    teams the opportunity to increase their chance of commercial success through funds
    for the acquisition of modest amounts of equipment or materials needed to fabricate
    prototypes, travel expenses to consult with potential clients or experts, or other
    resources needed to directly advance the goals of transitioning a team's project
    into the marketplace. In addition, the Site offers access to resources and training
    to the sponsored entrepreneurial teams in order to nurture UA faculty, staff and
    students to transition their innovative technologies into the marketplace. \n\nBroader
    Impacts:\nThe direct impact is to educate the UA community in technology commercialization,
    transition teams to becoming NSF I-Corps trained teams and form start-up companies.
    The potential long term impact is to provide them with the education and skills
    that will position them to become part of the knowledgeable, creative workforce
    that will help the US maintain leadership in critical areas of science, technology,
    engineering, and mathematics (STEM).  The University of Alabama Site provides
    a formal structure to nurture entrepreneurial teams and guide the output of scientific
    discoveries closer to the development of technologies, products, and processes
    that benefit society. AIME has consistently recruited underrepresented STEM students
    and the Site will leverage the university's STEM Path to the MBA program and will
    encourage and advance minority participation in STEM-based entrepreneurial activities.
    In addition to impacting the university community, this Site program will enhance
    networking and partnerships through the involvement of AIME's mentors, who provide
    a network in their specific industries. Through providing a database of contacts,
    providing interaction with experts and providing top notch seminars, the University
    of Alabama Site has the opportunity to increase public participation in STEM activities
    by providing modest funds for prototypes and exploration into product-market fit,
    which increases the chance of commercial success. The University of Alabama Site
    has the opportunity to enhance the value of new ventures and make them better-positioned

    likely to impact the ecosystem of the georgraphical region where this institution
    is located. In the past, Delaware benefitted from the presence of several large,
    hi-tech employers But, lingering effects from the economic downturn reduced the
    state's social and economic wellbeing. Consequently, an increase in startup activity,
    and the associated creation of new jobs, will serve to improve the economic wellbeing
    of Delaware and the surrounding region.  Broader impacts resulting from participation
    in the I-Corps Program will also include improved educational outcomes and competitiveness
    for STEM students, and stronger partnerships between academia and industry. The
    possibility of receiving funding and joining an I-Corps team may incentivize STEM
    students to learn about innovation and entrepreneurship by participating in existing
    training opportunities, thereby improving their educational outcomes and competitiveness.
    Stronger partnerships between academia and industry will result from interactions

    project consists of a national Summit for Broadening Participation (BP) and inclusiveness
    within the academic community that comprises the NSF National Innovation Network
    (NIN). This BP Summit initiative is motivated by several statistics: while Blacks
    comprise over 14% of the workforce in all private industries in the United States,
    they account for only 7.4% of the high-tech workforce, and people of color represent
    only 8% of US innovators. By contrast, whites account for nearly 64% of the workforce
    in all private U.S. industries, but over 68% of the high-tech workforce. Hispanic
    workers are also underrepresented, comprising just under 14% of jobs in all private
    U.S. industries, but less than 8% in high-tech industries, and women represent
    only 12% of US Innovators. \n\nThe BP Summit for inclusiveness in innovation and
    entrepreneurship has several key objectives: provide participants with an understanding
    of how academic institutions and individuals can boot-strap themselves into the
    mainstream sphere of commercialization, particularly through the I-Corps programs;
    provide insights into the impacts that programs like I-Corps have had on individuals
    and institutions; connect champions at MSIs with existing I-Corps Nodes and Sites
    personnel; highlight winning strategies employed by individuals and institutions
    and outcomes of successful innovations; increase the participation of under-represented
    groups in I-Corps training at the local, regional, and national levels, both at
    the team and instructor levels; provide opportunities for networking and collaborations
    between attendees.\n\nThe Summit brings together representatives of: Historically
    Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs),
    Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSI), I-Corps Node and Site personnel, researchers
    in the fields of inclusiveness and entrepreneurship, and, leadership from organizations
    serving the target population who can help innovation and entrepreneurship to
    their members such as the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE), the Society
    of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE), the Society of Women Engineers (SWE),
    the Association of Students of African Origin (ASAO), Women in Engineering ProActive
    Network (WEPAN), and the National Action Council for Minorities in Engineering
    (NACME).\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy

    The broader impact/commercial potential of the Southwest I-Corps Node (SWICORPS) project will derive from its extensive reach and its carefully structured programming and research.  SWICORPS is the largest Node in the program, covering five states from Oklahoma to the Texas-Mexico border (over 800 miles), and from New Mexico to Louisiana (over 1,000 miles). SWICORPS includes four Research 1 level institutions and will leverage its access to almost 500 degree-granting institutions to build entrepreneurship capacity in the region. SWICORPS will introduce faculty and students throughout the region to the I-Corps entrepreneurial curricula, ultimately increasing the economic impact of their research. The activities of the node will build a cadre of STEM researchers and students with an entrepreneurial mindset and appropriate training to exploit their research discoveries in the marketplace. With nearly half a million students enrolled in Minority Serving Institutions in Texas alone, SWICORPS will focus efforts and outreach to the regions most underserved areas to grow the entrepreneurial ecosystem.

    This I-Corps Node project provides training and infrastructure to share the Lean Launchpad I-Corps curriculum with affiliates across a vast and diverse region. It will continue to expand to reach new trainers and impact early-stage startups, including those from Sites located in the region. These activities will help to build a regional critical mass of technology-based companies. The I-Corps Node will raise awareness of the value of entrepreneurship and business skills among science and engineering faculty, researchers, and students through its customized regional programs and outreach initiatives. This Node will build on best practices to develop an effective mentor network and aid teams in identification of mentors for national program training. The partner schools will contribute to the National Innovation Network for the development of new curricula and advanced tools. The node will exploit metrics and outcomes from its regional activities to better understand the entrepreneurial mindset, and to determine which tools best serve entrepreneurs during and after the customer discovery process. Southwest I-Corps Node's recruitment of strong national teams will continue to increase the impact of federally funded research, and will contribute to innovation, job creation, and economic growth, both in the region and throughout the country.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to enable personalized monitoring of sudden cardiac events and heart arrhythmia by combining a wearable device and cloud computing. The project will utilize a patented cloud-connected ring sensor for long-term on-demand Electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring. Current ECG monitoring is a $4 billion dollar market. However no existing product can provide on-demand multi-lead ECG signals over long periods (over one month). Every year over 380,000 Americans die from heart attacks, of which one third happen outside a hospital, motivating a solution to a personalized cardiac monitoring device which can provide actionable diagnosis on-demand and is connected with physicians for quick intervention. This project will potentially enable a first-in-kind ring ECG sensor to serve this unmet need. This I-Corps project will support extensive customer discovery with cardiac patients, healthcare workers, cardiologists, nurses, and telemedicine companies.  In addition, through the NSF I-Corps Team program, two engineering doctoral students will learn important entrepreneurial skills such as the lean start-up model, go through an intensive and rigorous customer discovery process, and network with potential investors and partners.

    This I-Corps project integrates wearable devices with cloud computing to enable personalized cardiac monitoring on-demand. The intellectual merit of the project stems from the innovation of flexible electronics based miniature ECG sensors and cloud-based informatics system. By integrating wearable ECG sensors and cloud computing, on-demand cardiac monitoring information can be shared with cardiologists and emergency physicians. A smartphone can be used to receive physician-suggested actions for early intervention. During this I-Corps project, the team will explore the market potential for cloud-based wearable biosensors at point-of-care settings for cardiac applications where long term on-demand monitoring is important. The project will involve an extensive customer discovery process with potential stakeholders, business model generation and potential partner identification.   More broadly, this platform technology is also applicable to other wearable devices and chronic conditions such as high blood pressure, depression and dementia.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    Intellectual Merit:
    The United States faces significant challenges in rapidly and efficiently bringing emerging science and engineering innovations to use in industry and commerce. To maintain our world leadership in scientific and engineering research and education, we need processes that enable the practical and scalable application of promising discoveries from research and university laboratories. For university research to achieve greater impact, academic researchers and their students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) need tools and preparation for evaluating whether research discoveries can be readily translated into practical applications and eventual commercialization. For these reasons, NSF established the I-Corps training program in 2011 to support NSF-funded researchers in learning how to evaluate their scientific research for commercial potential. The National Collegiate Inventors and Innovators Alliance, Inc., d/b/a VentureWell, proposes to continue its work with NSF to plan, implement and evaluate five (5) additional I-Corps workshops (National Team Trainings) and two (2) National Faculty Training events.

    Broader Impacts:
    The I-Corps program provides NSF-funded principal investigators and their team members with funding
    and training enabling them to evaluate their technologies and research discoveries for commercial
    feasibility. The ultimate goal of the program is to increase the economic and societal impact of NSF
    research funding directly, through commercialization of research, and indirectly, by equipping scientists
    and engineers with skills and experience in developing and testing economically scalable models for the
    development of a product or technology. By the end of the program, I-Corps grantees are expected to
    reach a decision about the commercial readiness of their technology or product and take with them a set
    of skills that they can continue to apply in their research careers. Program participants evaluate and
    translate their research into applications that have commercial potential and can benefit society. Many
    participants will have identified promising commercial pathways that can lead to new high tech ventures
    or licensing opportunities. Since the program's inception, I-Corps teams have formed 350 companies that
    have attracted over $83 million in follow-on investment and grants. These companies operate in a broad
    range of sectors including health, energy, materials, agriculture and information technology and are
    geographically distributed across 43 states.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project involves providing significantly lower operating costs, broader material variety, and faster speeds than currently available with the fused-deposition modeling (FDM) additive manufacturing process. As additive manufacturing transitions from a prototyping tool to manufacturing solution, the demand for fast, inexpensive, and dynamic 3D printing solutions will continue to grow. The Resin Mini-Extruder is capable of integrating with existing 3D printer electro-mechanical systems and processing raw plastic pellets (resin) directly into a final part, unlike existing FDM technologies that require a filament feedstock. Raw pelletized plastics are typically a tenth to hundredth the cost of comparable filaments, which allow for significantly lower costs per print. In addition, the proposed solution is capable of printing a wide variety of plastics that are very difficult to print with existing extruders, including thermoplastic elastomers and polymer composites. The Resin Mini-Extruder is capable of significantly faster production than existing FDM technologies, which will enable high turnover of design prototypes and production parts.

    This I-Corps project is based on prior NSF-funded research involving a design framework for biomimetic elasto-fluidic systems. The research inspired the invention of a novel technology for manufacturing elasto-fluidic actuators, which forms the basis of this I-Corps project. The technology, the Resin Mini-Extruder for additive manufacturing, is a screw-driven extrusion system, which includes a novel screw-drive extruder and dynamic control system. The intent is to implement the extruder with existing 3D printer electro-mechanical systems in a FDM additive manufacturing process. The invention of the Resin Mini-Extruder was motivated by the need to print materials that existing FDM technologies are incapable of processing, namely thermoplastic elastomers. A goal of this I-Corps project is to determine whether customers demand broader material variety from FDM and if so, which materials and composites are preferred. The I-Corps process will also be used to determine the extent at which the other technology advantages are valued among customers, including cost per print and print speed, in particular applications.

    by the campus-wide Carnegie Mellon Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship
    (CIE), is to implement a systematic and replicable agile startup methodology,
    focused on customer discovery and product adaptation. \n\nThe CMU I-Corps Site
    leverages Carnegie Mellon's strengths and past successes in fusing technology
    with entrepreneurship. Their Site utilizes CMU's network of internal and external
    contacts to train entrepreneurial faculty and student teams working in STEM fields.
    CMU's curricular model is based on the i6 Agile Innovation System and is consistent
    with the I-Corps Curriculum. It includes four elements: workshops, mentoring,
    funding for projects and customer discovery, and incubator space.\n\nThe objectives
    of the CMU Site are to: \n1) capitalize on CMU's culture of innovation by expanding
    programs to nurture entrepreneurial ventures and transition university research
    to the market; \n2) train individuals to understand basic motivations, processes,
    practices, and challenges of innovation and entrepreneurship;\n3) hone individuals'
    entrepreneurial practices and skills; \n4) collaborate with industry, entrepreneurs,
    and the business community in the region and nation. \n\nThe CMU program will
    recruit teams from: existing entrepreneurial activities, course projects, college
    liaisons, and an open call. Underrepresented groups will be especially encouraged
    to apply. Teams will be encouraged to avail themselves of enrichment opportunities
    such as funding avenues, venture competitions, and business events. Each team
    will have an Entrepreneurial Lead, an Academic Lead, and a Mentor.  \n\nThe assessment
    plan focuses on ascertaining the most effective components of an agile university
    entrepreneurship training program. Teams' milestones and customer contacts will
    be tracked. Formative assessment using tools such as pre-, mid-, and post-program
    surveys will inform the CMU program evolution.\n\nOf particular merit is this
    proposed Site's agile and adaptable customer-based training program, components
    of which have been shown to be successful in programs such as the i6 Agile Innovation
    System and the I-Corps Curriculum/Lean Launch Pad. Combining these components
    -- and then distilling through assessment and evaluation which of them are especially
    effective at spurring creativity, resourcefulness, independence, and connectivity
    -- will further entrepreneurial knowledge and education. The program will also
    teach entrepreneurial students and faculty how to create their own ecosystem by
    engaging in customer discovery and network building. \n\nThe CMU I-Corps Site
    plans to move university research out of the lab more efficiently and effectively.
    Expediting the movement of academic innovation to the commercial sector allows
    new, often government-funded, university discoveries and inventions to reach the
    public sector earlier spawning new endeavors and economic growth. All sectors
    of society and areas of inquiry -- healthcare, energy, sustainability, global
    communication, for example, can see benefits. In addition, making earlier decisions
    about viability of commercial outcomes is beneficial as it can more effectively
    utilize critical resources --time, energy, talent, and funds. In addition, a successful
    Site will likely impact the Pittsburgh, Steel Valley, and Allegheny Valley communities."

    and student community, in particular among females and underrepresented minorities.
    \n- Provide real world experiential learning to the student teams participating
    in the process while facilitating access to the region?s innovation ecosystem
    and entrepreneurial support network. \n- Expand the suite of offerings that the
    von Liebig Center can provide to students and faculty for its services to the
    earlier stages of technology translation. \n- Collaborate on ?best-practices?
    by becoming a member of an I-Corps Site network that shares insights with a wide
    community of similar centers in the Nation.  \n\nThese goals will be accomplished
    through entrepreneurship curricula, identification, selection, and intervention
    activities, mentoring, and assignment of resources for early stage development
    - all of which contribute to the academic research translation process through
    the creation of an integrated, experiential, educational program that focuses
    on the training of academic innovators while they are still engaged in the early
    stages of the discovery process. \n\nThe vLC has solid processes in place for
    recruiting, vetting, and supporting teams through their I-Corps Site. They have
    many noteworthy examples of startups they have supported through their existing

    state of California. \n\nBroader Impact:\n\nThe vLC I-Corps SIte will strengthen
    and broaden the pipeline of innovations from the university while promoting entrepreneurial
    thinking and activities to thrive in the academic environment. \n\nBy encouraging
    student and faculty/researcher participation actively translating research to
    early stage development, new products or services will be launched resulting in
    the creation of high value jobs and economic growth in the region. \n\nEntrepreneurial
    students from underrepresented groups will have a support network inside the university
    that will give them the confidence needed to thrive and participate in the process.
    \n\nOutcomes will be widely disseminated by becoming a member of the NSF I-Corps
    Site network, thus catalyzing innovation in technology discoveries. The most important
    impact of this proposed approach is building entrepreneurial principles, early-stage
    commercialization pipelines, and early-stage incubation schemas. These practices,
    when proven successful in this approach, can be integrated or replicated to other

The project promises to enhance such operations through the extraction of information from the collected data and the provision of time-critical insights at a fraction of the costs of current commercial tools. The monitoring innovation will potentially become the first solution in the market capable of continuously monitoring goods in outdoor environments. In addition, the monitoring innovation will potentially become the first cost-affordable monitoring solution for low-value goods. The innovation promises a primary impact in the sectors of defense and construction. In reality, though, it offers the potential to positively impact the cost and efficiency of complex inventory and warehouse management operations across US industry sectors. This I-Corps team will cross-pollinate discovery and innovation across the broad spectrum of implementation scenarios by addressing the existing latent inefficiencies in such operations.

    This I-Corps project explores the market potential of the real-time monitoring, predictive, and inexpensive innovation in support of inventory and warehouse management operations. A realistic real-time monitoring solution without the need for static communications infrastructure is a technically complex endeavor beyond the capabilities of commercial tracking and monitoring tools. The proposed innovation optimizes operations and information flows, and the response to upstream (push) and downstream (pull) processes and overall system performance. As large datasets are fused the artificial intelligence aspect of the innovation automatically identifies inefficiencies and bottlenecks, and reassesses forecasts and system decisions that account for latest events, data uncertainties, and multiple local optima. This I-Corps team plans to investigate the market potential of the innovation, validate customer needs and how the innovation can alleviate such needs, and discern sustainable business models.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    to identify the customer needs and develop a minimum viable robotic assistive
    device that will enable disabled individuals to care for themselves, improve their
    mobility, independence and quality of life while reducing the burden on their
    families and communities. There is opportunity for launching a homecare equipment
    market through the adaptive sports clubs and the clinical facilities. The elderly
    and disabled assistive devices global market was valued at $14 billion in 2015
    and is expected to surpass $26 billion by 2024. The outcome of the project will
    further help researchers, educators, and clinicians to discover new approaches/technology
    to satisfy unmet needs of customers. This I-Corps project will provide hands on
    training and experience for an engineering undergraduate student (co-entrepreneurial
    lead) and graduate student (entrepreneurial lead) on the customer discovery process.
    The PI will also gain exposure to the customer discovery process, and will incorporate
    the learnings from this course in ongoing and future projects within his research
    lab and engineering senior design classes. The project activities are intimately
    linked to educational activities that will teach students at various levels about
    the customer discovery process, entrepreneurship, hypothesis testing, etc. \n\nThis
    I-Corps project will advance understanding of the problems and needs of disabled
    individuals with upper/lower extremity impairments from different conditions.
    The intellectual merit of the project lies in the development of a sustainable
    business model canvas around the proposed technology and in the novel design and
    development of the proposed robotic assistive arm (R2A). The R2A that we envision
    is a 7 degrees of freedom anthropomorphic robotic hand that can be mounted on
    a wheelchair or any mobile platform. It can be controlled either by hand/foot/mouth
    control depending on the patient?s needs. This will allow the patient, regardless
    of the disability, to control the robot. The fundamental research conducted so
    far includes development of an upper-extremity robotic exoskeleton to provide
    arm movement therapy. This I-Corps project will find the gaps between the customer
    unmet needs and the approaches/technology currently being used to satisfy their
    needs. The project activities will unite different customers? problems, needs,
    and existing solutions; and form a symbiotic relationship to overcome the critical
    barrier to advancing the field of assistive robotics. Overall, the proposed project
    will significantly advance the knowledge of how robotic devices can meaningfully
    and effectively be used in caregiving and rehabilitation.\n\nThis award reflects

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project 'Non-Silane Coupling Agents' rests on the environmental advantage of a new technology platform of coupling agents with potential performance advantages for tire applications. The global tire and rubber companies consume $325 million in silane coupling agents each year. About half of the weight of the silane coupling agents (i.e., ~10 kTon or ~1-5% by weight of the tire) is converted to ethanol and, if not captured, released into the atmosphere as a volatile organic compound (VOC). By replacing the silane moiety in the conventional silane coupling agents with a catechol functional group, the non-silane coupling (NSC) technology completely eliminates the VOC generated during tire manufacture. If other industrial sectors that currently use silanes also adopt the catechol-based technology, ~50 kTon of annual VOC emission will be eliminated. The NSC technology introduces a disruptive replacement for the mature silane-based coupling technology, whose intellectual properties have long expired and whose manufacture is exclusively based in Asia. The NSC technology will also level the playingfield for US rubber and tire manufacturers against their competitors in developing countries, where the environmental regulations are relaxed.

    This I-Corps project 'Non-Silane Coupling Agents' is a clean intellectual departure from the current silane-based technology, taking advantage of the exceptional ability of the catechol motif to form chelation on the surface of silica. The approach is fundamentally novel. The technology is the outcome of a research program sponsored by the NSF I/UCRC Center of Tire Research. The activities encompassed by the I-Corps Teams program will allow us the deep dive necessary to truly understand the customer opportunity, tailor the novel disruptive technology to meet these needs at an early R&D stage and enhances the probability of success. The R&D and business team bring together extensive experience working in the areas of rubber chemistry, technology, marketing, and business management.

    in the identification of the most effective strategy for the deployment of novel
    and improved materials for lithium-ion batteries. Our society is already experiencing
    the pressing need for better electrochemical energy storage technologies. These
    would be beneficial not only for consumer electronics devices and electric vehicles,
    but would also aid the transition towards renewable energy sources, bringing enormous
    benefits in terms of public health and reduced environmental hazards. The successful
    commercialization of more energy dense lithium-ion batteries represents a crucial
    and fundamental requirement for this vision to be realized. Unfortunately the
    graphite-based battery anode, while being the most widely utilized technology,
    is already approaching its theoretical limit. The technology at the center of
    this proposal overcomes the limitations of graphite while enabling a straightforward
    integration in the current battery production scheme. Participation in the I-Corps
    program will allow establishing the most effective pathway towards the commercialization
    of this new technology.   \n\nThis I-Corps project is based on a novel material
    that increase the storage capacity of commercial lithium-ion batteries by roughly
    30%. The compound, a silicon-graphite composite powder, displays a storage capacity
    six times higher (1800 mA g-1) than graphite (365 mA g-1), the current anode material
    of choice in commercial lithium ion batteries, and is produced with an innovative
    proprietary fabrication method suitable for large-scale production. The composite
    can be used as an additive to commercial lithium-ion batteries to partially or
    completely substitute graphite and boost the battery performance in terms of both
    gravimetric and volumetric energy density. Notably, the compound it is fully compatible
    with the current lithium-ion battery industrial production processes, allowing
    for a cost-effective introduction into the manufacturing process without additional
    capital investments. To enable the breakthrough of this concept into the market,
    the current efforts are focused on the customer discovery process through the
    I-Corps program with the goal of identifying an ideal first customer segment.\n\nThis

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project, based on wireless charging technology, is wide ranging. The expansion of drone applications, use of industrial and multifunctional robots, mobile electronics and sensors and gadgets associated with the internet of things, call for new charging mechanisms for these battery operated devices. The initial market entry point for this project, drone service providers, will not only progress the drone industry but also the industries that drone applications serve.  For agriculture, more effective drone monitoring will increase percent yield of crops as farmers are able to monitor crop growth more effectively.  For search and rescue, remote drone charging stations could help save lives as drones are able to travel further distances.  For oil and gas, drones are already seen as a safer and more cost effective way to monitor fields.  As drone autonomy applications expand, wireless charging technology enabled by this I-Corps project will become essential in package delivery and disaster relief operations as well as a broad range of other industries.  Wireless charging technology will also lower production costs for automated manufacturing and factories adopting industrial internet-of-things sensors and devices.

    This I-Corps project leverages wireless charger technology which is capable of powering devices at distances of a few centimeters to one meter, with an option for charging capability from a few Watts up to a few Kilowatts. Commercially available Qi chargers and near-field non-radiative magnetic induction based wireless chargers result in a rapid degradation of the power transfer efficiency (PTE) with as distance increases. Compared to other magnetic resonance based chargers, the patented technology of this I-Corps project offers less degradation in power efficiency with distance, the ability to charge multiple devices on both sides of the transmitter, and allows for developing thin flexible receivers that can be mounted on planar, singly and doubly curved surfaces. Further, the charger can be tuned in real time for optimum efficiency when the distance between the transmitter and receiver changes. In addition, the possibility of integrating the charger with the drone fuselage eliminates the problems associated with aerodynamic drag which results if a stand-alone charger is mounted on the drone, saves drone "real estate", and reduces the weight of the overall system.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project focuses on the development of a lower-cost, improved performance infrared radiation detection technology.  Numerous technologies presently exist for detecting Infrared radiation.  Those which are cost effective for commercial applications tend to lack adequate performance specifications, while those with ideal performance are too expensive.  This technology has broad application potential.  The proposed I-Corps program explores implementation and commercialization opportunities within the project's initial application focus of Nondispersive Infrared (NDIR) gas sensing of carbon dioxide and volatile organic compounds (VOC), such as methane and ethylene gas.  These sensors have significant markets related to smart ventilation systems for cars, homes, and businesses, as well as leak monitoring in industrial processes and oil and gas production.  Further enabling the mass deployment of these sensors will have significant impact on energy conservation, environmental protection, and health and safety.  Additionally, longer term development of the technology may prove to be disruptive in thermal imaging applications.  Presently, thermal imaging applications are broad but the hardware is often too cumbersome and expensive to be practical for commercial use.

    This I-Corps project is based on the premise that the intersection of different scientific disciplines leads to disruptive innovation.  The project's technology is a fundamentally different approach to infrared radiation detection than those developed in the past 50+ years.  This project pursues an optical solution to a semiconductor material processing problem which has hampered the realization of adequate production yield, manufacturing scalability, and device performance, resulting in too high a cost and limited suitability for many commercial applications.  Previous progress on this project has focused on the theoretical development of the optical design and experimental verification of these nanofabricated structures.  Initial results have been encouraging, and work continues to enhance responsivity, as well as other necessary device specifications.  This I-Corps process will be used to refine our understanding of customer problems/needs and the potential for our technology to solve them.  This will further inform our technology development path and specification focus, enabling the release of a useful product to market sooner.

- abstractText: |-
    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the elimination or reduction of metrology and post processing analysis that is currently a standard requirement of polymer part manufacturing.  This process improvement that will be facilitated by sensor technology will reduce manufacturing time and cost by 20-40%, improve part quality consistency, and improve molding productivity by 100%. Each percentage point improvement in productivity corresponds to cost savings in excess of more than $1 billion per year in the United States alone while reducing the energy consumption and environmental waste related to molding, discarding, and/or recycling of defective plastic parts.

    This I-Corps project will enable the team to determine the ideal parameters of a multivariate shrinkage sensor for industrial polymer manufacturing.  The insights gained from at least one hundred customer interviews will drive decisions on the commercial potential of a new multi-mode shrinkage monitoring sensor that will obviate the need for manual inspections and enable fully automatic production by directly measuring molded products as they are made, before the mold opens, so that defectives parts can be automatically diagnoses and recycled.  Through I-Corps, the team will assess current sensor design, its relative value compared to existing sensors and inspection procedures in the polymer manufacturing industry, and facilitate identification of customer segments with a critical unmet need for in-mold shrinkage sensor capability. Further, key learning from the I-Corps process will drive refinement of sensor development with the goal of developing a more commercially relevant sensor and provide industrial connections for sensor testing in the future. This overall enhanced knowledge of the industry will additionally reduce commercialization risk should a start-up or licensing opportunity be pursued.

    on maximizing resources for frost defense, reducing yield loss, improving quality,
    supporting decision-making, and reducing frost management cost for grapes and
    stone fruits.  Cold periods and frost episodes are still one of the worst enemies
    of grape and stone fruit production worldwide.  Grape and orchard production are
    highly linked to climatic conditions, making sub-seasonal weather variability
    and its connections to climate change a challenging issue for this economic sector.
    Growers may presently deploy fossil fuel heaters, sprinkler systems, the downward
    draft from helicopters and wind machines to fight spring frost damage. These methods
    are usually costly, some create environmental concerns, and in many cases they
    may be limited by water availability and area coverage.  Altering timing of bud
    break stages that are susceptible to frost injury appears to be a viable alternative
    to cope with current and emerging challenges of climate change. The proposed I-Corp
    program explores implementation and commercialization opportunities of an end-to-end
    solution. The innovation combines a bioactive, non-toxic biodegradable encapsulation
    technology (spray) that alters internal grapevine physiology and promotes bud
    break delay. A predictive analytic system provides recommendations to make informed
    decisions about frost risk management.\n \nThis I-Corps project is based on a
    series of studies that have combined pruning management, biophysical and biochemical
    factors influencing the endogenous regulation of bud break, and resistance to
    cold injury.  In addition, the project combines this knowledge with an analytic
    data platform (software) that will analyze plant development as a function of
    environmental temperature (phenology), topographic and soil data, at the farm
    level.  Combination with global and regional patterns of climate patterns will
    aid understanding climate variability at high spatial and temporal scale. This
    platform will allow better prediction for decision making at the vineyard and
    orchard level to reduce some of the most significant challenges associated with
    prediction reliability about bud break and risk of frost.  Moreover, this predictive
    analytic system will be the foundation for continued innovation in tools and services
    to support decision-making to adapt growing practices, and to preserve sustainability
    due to already observed and worsening climate change impacts.  The I-Corp process
    will also be used to refine our understanding of customer value, willingness to
    pay and the cost of the best current alternatives.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the potential commercialization of a platform technology for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Complex tissue injuries and non-healing wounds represent a global therapeutic challenge, making tissue engineering and regenerative medicine a multi-billion commercial opportunity with many unmet clinical needs.  Today most wound care products rely on a "degrade and replace" mechanism, mediated by inflammation and resulting in disorganized scar tissue. The innovative technology, on which this project is based, works by a mechanism of "persist and regenerate" to restore tissue architecture and function. Additionally, these materials have unique capacity for customization, positioning it for future applications in areas including soft tissue reconstruction such as after tumor removal; repair of tendons, ligaments, and bone; tissue bulking agents for treating urinary incontinence or laryngeal paralysis; and for cellular therapies such as islet transplantation for diabetes. Taken together, these attributes will potentially enable innovative, low-cost products for personalized tissue engineering that have potential to reduce health care costs and improve patient outcomes.

    This I-Corps project is based on an advanced tissue-derived product, namely Collymer Self-Assembly Matrix, which represents the first injectable collagen which exhibits self-assembly-the ability to transition from a fluid to a stable fibrillar scaffold upon injection. This technology was inspired by new mechanistic insights into i) collagen synthesis and assembly as occurs within the body and ii) mechanobiology signaling which relies on cell-collagen biophysical interactions. Because Collymers immediately restore the natural tissue architecture by forming collagen fibrils just like those found in the body, this natural biomaterial is non-inflammatory and exhibits superior tissue regeneration. Collymers' unique capacity for patient-specific customization by incorporating cells and customizing the architecture of the scaffold (density, shape, and architecture) makes it the first personalized tissue regeneration/engineering technology. The specific aims of the I-Corps project is to explore and prioritize most promising applications for this technology as well as the best path to commercialization considering factors such as reimbursement, regulatory path and customer segment.

    the stabilization of temperature-sensitive formulations. Temperature-sensitive
    formulations, such as protein drugs and vaccines, require costly cold-chains for
    the transportation and storage. This requirement not only poses significant costs
    and great quality challenges for these products, but also may not be fulfilled
    under extreme environments or in certain regions. This unmet need may consequently
    limit the use of life-saving drugs. Enabling transportation and/or storage outside
    cold chains will resolve these problems having significant commercial markets
    and benefits. \n\nThis I-Corps project is focused on a technology towards thermally
    stable formulations. This innovative, multifunctional technology based on ice-binding
    polypeptide (IBP) platforms, in particular, applies  previously unaddressed roles
    of IBP in thermal stabilization and carbohydrate crystallization controls to enable
    the stabilization of heat sensitive formulations/products during transportation
    and storage. The IBP stabilization technology can efficiently stabilize temperature-sensitive
    proteins and formulations under a wide range of temperatures, which may eventually
    enable the transportation and storage of these formulations outside cold chains.
    The ultimate goal is to enable cold-chain free transportation and storage of temperature
    sensitive formulations/products using the IBP stabilization technology. Specifically,
    the goals in this NSF I-Corps project are to understand the market needs by extensive

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will be to improve our understanding of the market forces that drive the need/use of antimicrobial materials. With ~1.7 million healthcare-associated infections causing upwards of 99,000 deaths annually in the United States, and adding about $30-45 billion to health care costs every year, the potential societal impact stemming from this proposed activity include a better understanding of the market forces that govern the need/use of antimicrobial materials. Understanding such forces will be important for the creation of the next generation of antimicrobial materials, and will impact the fields of materials and polymer science, textile engineering, packaging, and infectious disease (microbiology, virology) by providing performance guidelines in terms of material characteristics, physical properties, and antimicrobial efficacy. Food processing, packaging and service industries, waste water treatment, daycare facilities, and personal households are other potential areas that will benefit from this project. As such, given the potential commercial applications of platform antimicrobial technologies, narrowing the number of possible products and identifying a few key markets will be important for their commercialization, and this effort will be to better define the most viable products from which to commercialize platform antimicrobial technologies.

    This I-Corps project aims to help the research team arrive at a go/no-go decision on whether to pursue commercialization of an anti-infective material: comprised of nanofibrillated cellulose (NFC) into which are embedded photosensitizers (PS, chemical compounds that react with light and emit biocidal oxygen), this photoactive material, termed NFC-PS, is capable of the rapid, efficient, and low-cost sterilization of a wide range of infective agents, including drug-resistant bacteria and viruses, making it a platform technology from which to develop self-sterilizing materials. The intellectual merits of the proposed voice-of-customer research will establish the market-driven need for antimicrobial materials, including: i) to identify what customers and/or potential licensees would need in terms of anti-infective material properties (e.g. longevity, chemical resistance, integration into existing products, maximum cost or price points, EPA and/or FDA regulatory approvals); ii) to help identify potential products that could be improved by adding antimicrobial characteristics to them; and iii) to complete a business model canvas for the NFC-PS technology. Initial product ideation based upon the NFC-PS platform technology will be narrowed to 1-2 main products from a much broader number of market categories, and will be used to identify what prototype(s) should be developed along the path to commercialization.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to provide technical services to homeowners, local municipalities, engineering and insurance companies to enhance community resilience and sustainability against multi-hazard events such as hurricane that can bring strong wind, storm surge and wide spread inundation. The proposed resilience technology contributes to a paradigm shift in practice from engineering design code methods to performance-based approach that considers structural resiliency concepts and quantifies property hazard risk and value over time. The in-house developed technology utilizes the hydrodynamic simulations to calculate the flood impacts and combines it with the structural and socioeconomic features of built environment. The multi-faceted tool will inform individuals, local municipalities, coastal building designers, increasing the performance and resiliency of this building stock and ensuring greater post-event community function, insurance companies underwriting flood insurances and calculating premiums. Progress and information to be gained through the I-Corps program, in interactions with hazard insurance and risk assessment companies as well as engineering and information service groups will enable our team to expedite the translation of the proposed technology to the market. The developed technologies will be scalable and broadly applicable to other hazard types and regions with potentials of expanding to at international markets.

    This I-Corps project aims to offer a comprehensive predictive tool that provides a pin-point quantitative assessment of the damage and resiliency scenarios of individual properties and up-scaling it to larger infrastructure cluster to introduce a new understanding of the community wide vulnerability considering available social and human capitals. The innovative and ground breaking aspect of this work is that this project for the first time consolidating hydrodynamic, structural and socioeconomic information through a massive big data campaign followed by interactive analysis to open a new window in understanding impacts of extreme events. Specifically, the intellectual merit of this approach resides in its (a) Holistic approach to performance-based design of building (b) Application of state-of-the-art data driven predictive models and advanced computational technologies in flood damage and resiliency assessment of buildings (c) High modularity in building design and prototyping process which supports expansion to other hazards and building types, and (d) Potential to create new knowledge regarding optimal multi-hazard building design. The approach provides comprehensive support to decision makers and designers by estimating building vulnerability and resiliency over construction property, operation and hazards, and by balancing competing objectives.

    The broader impact of this I-Corps project is to investigate the challenges that data scientists face in debugging big data analytics today and to investigate the commercial potential of research work on interactive and automated debugging of big data analytics. Big data analytics is increasingly important in the 21st century, where our daily lives leave behind a detailed digital record. Decision-makers of all kinds, from companies to government agencies, would like to base their actions on data. If successful, this project will offer a unique opportunity to discover software development tooling needs for big data systems and to identify innovative software tooling products that sit across the software stack from the user-facing API all the way down to the systems infrastructure.

    This I-Corps project builds on early research work on real-time debugging primitives and tool-assisted fault-localization services for big data processing applications written in modern data intensive scalable computing (DISC) systems like Apache Spark. Designing debugging primitives for DISC requires re-thinking the traditional step-through debugging primitives as provided by tools such as gdb. For example, a breakpoint feature that simply pauses the entire computation would waste large amounts of computational resources and prevent correct tasks from completing, reducing overall throughput. Further, requiring the user to inspect the millions of intermediate records produced during execution is clearly infeasible. When a failure or incorrect result is generated (e.g., outlier), pinpointing the root cause is extremely time-consuming and expensive due to massive scale of data. In short, the intellectual merit of this I-Corps project is to investigate how users can benefit from expressive debugging primitives and automated fault localization services when they must leverage for data science and big data analytics capabilities.

    technology has its basis in a range of microfluidic cooling products. The potential
    of the technology is its positive impacts on several computing technologies where
    it may expand the limits of processing frequency and therefore system speed/performance.
    Commercial applications that can benefit from the project's technology are broad,

    centers, graphics computing in the fields of artificial intelligence, self-driving
    transportation, videogame hardware, digital currency (blockchain) technology,

    such as lasers, concentrated solar photovoltaics, and thermoelectric products,
    among many potential markets that use liquid-cooling systems at some level. \n\nThis
    I-Corps project is motivated by a technology that consists of an embedded microfluidic
    cooling layer that offers significantly enhanced heat removal capabilities when
    compared with current thermal hardware -- this is as a result of eliminating the
    thermal interfaces and heat spreaders commonly used in microelectronic devices.
    The heat removal is directly managed by bonding the microfluidic cooling layer
    to the silicon chip surface through a metallic joint. The resulting micro-cooling
    layer replaces the need for the heat spreader used in current technologies since
    the microstructures embedded in the cooling layer have the appropriate feature
    sizes and layout with an appropriate flow distribution through engineered manifolds
    for effective heat dissipation. This technology provides the capability of unlocking
    the clock frequency on micro-processing units by allowing the input of higher
    voltages to the computing cores, while also keeping the device temperature below
    design limits. Laboratory experimentation with these microfluidic cooling layers
    under a wide variety of operating conditions and refrigerants has demonstrated
    capabilities for removing heat fluxes of up to 500 W/cm2; a 5x increase when compared
    with the current maximum heat fluxes of commercial, high-end central processing
    units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs).\n\nThis award reflects NSF's

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project on healthcare, quality of life, and the medical device industry is tremendous. The novel technology and advancement of biodegradable metals and biomimetic interfaces will lead to next-generation medical devices and implants that promote tissue healing and eliminate secondary surgeries for implant removal. This will improve quality of life for patients who need medical implants to support bones and tissue damaged by disease or trauma, and reduce overall healthcare costs. The project will build the foundation for commercializing biodegradable metallic implants and devices, which, in turn, will increase the competitiveness of U.S. companies in the medical device industry. The products resulting from this project will reduce pain and complications, eliminate secondary surgeries, and accelerate healing and recovery for patients who need medical implants due to trauma or disease.

    This I-Corps project will advance technology that eliminates the drawbacks of the non-degradable medical alloys on the market today. Magnesium (Mg) based alloys are a novel class of biodegradable metallic materials that have attractive mechanical and biological properties for a wide range of medical implant applications, such as orthopedic, spinal, dental, and craniofacial implants. The key challenge in commercializing Mg-based alloys for medical implant applications lies in controlling the degradation rate. NSF support has contributed to a novel class of biocompatible Mg alloys along with biomimetic surface treatment to provide tunable degradation rates, desirable bioactivity, and excellent mechanical strength for supporting faster healing and regeneration of damaged tissues. This novel solution contains non-toxic natural elements that induce healing and reduce inflammation, departed from traditional alloy design. The I-Corps project will transform this technology to commercially viable products that will benefit the customers in need.

    supply commercial beekeepers with a way to remotely monitor and identify honey
    bee colonies in need of management in real time, regardless of location, allowing
    for a reduction in annual colony loss. Currently, commercial beekeepers must rely
    on time intensive manual inspections to determine which colonies need assistance
    in the field. This practice is especially resource intensive for commercial migratory
    beekeepers who frequently relocate their honey bees to fulfill pollination services
    for US farmers. In addition, this proposed approach will allow for measuring impact
    of various agricultural landscapes on honey bee colony health, enabling farmers
    to engage in quantitative based discussions with farmers about pollinator friendly
    best practices. Ultimately this I-Crops project focuses on leveraging the economic
    importance of honey bees to create financial incentives for pollinator friendly
    farming practices across agricultural landscapes. \n\nThis I-Corps project leverages
    traditional large dataset analysis and machine learning to decipher and detect
    adverse conditions within the honey bee colony, and how the landscapes in which
    colonies reside contribute to overall colony health. This is possible through
    continuous monitoring of the internal colony environment, which is meticulously
    regulated and stable when the colony is healthy, and utilization of long range
    low power communications infrastructure. When a colony is unhealthy or suffers
    an adverse event, like the loss of a queen, the colonies internal environment
    is disrupted. Honey bee populations have experienced large annual losses recently
    and although substantial research has been conducted on honey bees residing in
    backyard or university research apiaries, no work (apart from limited popular
    press interviews) have attempted to document the problems, economic and biological,
    that commercial migratory beekeepers and their bees face on their annual pollination
    cycle. Remote monitoring of these commercial colonies will provide much needed
    insight into the inner lives of this cohort of economically critical insects,
    in addition to providing optimization and logistical support to an essential component
    of US agricultural production.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission
    and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
    intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project centers around cancer treatment using wireless radiofrequency. Radiofrequency ablation is a minimally invasive procedure where surgeons burn tissue inside the body using electricity. Ablation treatment has been applied in several medical disciplines including oncology, cardiology, dermatology, pain management, etc.According to the National Cancer Institute, there were more than 1.6 million new cases of cancer in 2017 and approximately 600,000 cancer patients died. Many of these cancer patients can be treated with ablation therapy. A significant amount of funding is invested in cancer care, with $125 billion spent in 2010 alone; this number is estimated to reach $156 billion in 2020. Other diseases have similar numbers of affected patents and high amounts of care expenditures as well. This I-Corps program will provide opportunities for the team to explore various avenues for the commercialization of their wireless radiofrequency ablation technology that has broad application in many treatment areas.

    This I-Corps project is the first wireless radiofrequency ablation device designed to streamline and simplify the current ablation procedure. Using the principle of magnetic resonance, a wirelessly powered radiofrequency ablation device simply includes an ablation generator and a needle. The ablation generator serves as a transmitting circuit that wirelessly sends power to the needle's receiving coil. The receiving coil is connected to the electrodes at the needle tip that ablates tumor tissue in contact. Existing ablation methods have multiple wires tethered to the ablation equipment that limit the surgeon's dexterity to position the ablation needles during the procedure. The weight and dragging of the wires could increase patient setup time and cause potential tissue laceration. Also, a limited number of ablation needles can be used simultaneously, making it time consuming to ablate large tumors. This project's wireless ablation technology requires no wires and allows an unlimited number of ablation needles during the procedure. An initial prototype has been developed to prove the concept of wireless ablation and tests have been performed to prove the concept of the proposed technology.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project relates to the developments in precision/personalized medicine, and specifically, to much-needed improvements in accuracy and speed of finding genome variants using next-generation sequencing (NGS). The personalized medicine concepts are based on individual genome variants and the personalized medicine market is expected to reach $178 billion in 2022. The cost advantage of a fast and accurate variant-finding product will be proportional to the number of genomes analyzed by users in this market. There has been a recent exponential increase in the size and scope of whole genome sequencing projects from 10,000 publicly available human genomes in 2016 to the UK 100,000 Genomes Project to even larger, though less-clearly defined, sequencing projects involving 1,000,000 participants proposed in the US (Precision Medicine Initiative, and Million Veteran Program) and China. In a likely and important scenario of sequencing the whole US population in the foreseeable future, the cost saving could be several billion dollars, thus making such efforts more feasible.

    This I-Corps project will enable entrepreneurial education and customer discovery for a software that will be based on a novel comprehensive method of genome variant detection, GROM (Genome Rearrangement Omni-Mapper). GROM boasts lightning-speed runtimes, an order of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art variant detection pipelines. While drastically reducing computational time, GROM provides superior overall variant detection compared to commonly employed algorithms. These unique advantages over available tools both in speed and precision could make GROM a very desirable application in this field (utilized via either licensing or pay-per-use commercial models). This will require a better understanding of a potential market and customer discovery. The process will include an educational component at I-Corps workshops and a discovery component via meetings and active communication with numerous potential users of the technology in commercial and non-commercial entities. The customer discovery effort may result in developing an appropriate business plan for attracting investments in a potential startup that will perform further development and licensing of the product.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to provide a novel, unique flow sensor implemented with the Elastic Filament Velocimetry (EFV) technology, to a number of markets and industries that will benefit from its ultra-low cost, ultra-low power consumption, and high precision flow measurements. For example, implementing a network of such inexpensive sensors can provide superior flow monitoring in HVAC ducts, significantly reduces controller costs and allows for improved system control to deliver better comfort to people while increase overall system efficiency. With the EFV sensors embedded in consumer appliances and fire sprinkler systems, early detection of water leakage can be realized, saving valuable clean water resources and reduce potential water damages to building management and homeowners alike. Utilization of the EFV technology in medical injections (such as intravenous injections) will fill the gap for precision real-time monitoring, and at the same time, reduce injection errors, increase patient safety, saving healthcare cost, and improve patient comfort.

    This I-Corps project aims to discover the commercial viability of the Elastic Filament Velocimetry, a nanoscale, MEMS based, strain based technology, for flow velocity / flow rate measurements. Mathematical models suggested that a high aspect-ratio, electrically conductive freestanding structure can be sensitive to extremely small fluid forcing when its size is reduced. Utilizing semiconductor manufacturing techniques, a miniature metallic ribbon was fabricated and tested in fluid flow, and the result matches theoretical prediction. This enables a new concept of flow sensing and measurement using a strain based device. This I-Corps project allows the opportunity to explore, learn, and engage in entrepreneurship discovery activities in a real-world setting. Incorporating the progressive learning techniques used by the program, lessons can be learned at a much faster pace, inspiring entrepreneurship and promoting engagement.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will provide the pharmaceutical industry with a predictive biological assay for drug screening to improve the quality of human life. Currently, testing the toxicity of new drug compounds on cultured cells and in animals has not been able to predict the response in human patients, leading to significant consequences for human patients and the pharmaceutical development process. One potential solution is so-called ?lab-on-a-chip? devices which are small devices that can be used to work with human cells in a laboratory testing environment. However, these devices are inherently limited and result in inaccurate drug dose response measurements due to the material properties of the silicone chambers within which cells are cultured. The adoption of advanced 3D cell culture environments which are composed of water-based materials and containing architectural features of normal tissue, such as multiple cell types and perfusable blood vessels, will enable improved predictive toxicological screening of new drug candidates. A reduced time and cost of testing compounds will be advantageous for the pharmaceutical market, while the expected improved predictive response in human patients is expected to usher in a new paradigm for human therapies. Furthermore, this project has the potential to scale 3D cell culture toward therapeutic value for human implantation to repair or replace damaged tissues and organs.

    This I-Corps project will explore commercial opportunities of our platform 3D cell culture system. This project is based on years of hardware, biomaterial, and tissue design development and validation for fabrication of advanced cell culture systems via 3D printing. We have demonstrated generation of various tissue models for lung, liver, and bone tissue applications and demonstrated long-term survival and function of human cells. The pursued approach for generating tissues has a high commercial potential by filling an essential need in preclinical drug compound testing for improved predictive tissue models. Additionally, utility of this technology can span into other unexplored markets for generation of complex tissue structures. Through exploration of commercialization routes for this innovation during the I-Corps project, we propose to investigate and validate new and emerging markets that could best utilize our platform.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is
    in the use of precision genome editing, in conjunction with compute simulation
    techniques, to impact local eradication of invasive species, agricultural pests,
    or disease-transmitting organisms. These organisms pose serious challenges to
    human and environmental health and cause billions of dollars in economic damages
    to the US every year. Numerous approaches to control populations of pest organisms
    currently rely on physical (trapping, deterrence), chemical (pesticides, baited
    traps), or biological (viruses, predators) mechanisms. These currently available
    methods have been unable to \"stem the tide\" in invasive pests and their application
    has resulted in unintended environmental impacts. There is an urgent need for
    control technologies that are broadly applicable, highly scalable, and cost-effective.
    Recent advances in precision genome editing have enabled a next generation of
    engineered biocontrol agents that promise to be effective while minimizing unwanted
    impacts on the environment. The technology on which this project is based will
    provide a means to prevent the reproduction of pest organisms without the introduction
    of toxins or pesticides. This I-Corps project will focus on mosquito control since
    they transmit numerous serious diseases (Zika, Dengue, etc.) that are predicted
    to become increasingly prevalent in the US. \n\nThis I-Corps project is based
    on the concept of engineering barriers to sexual reproduction to control pest
    populations. Some of the most effective pest eradication campaigns in recent history
    have used radiation to sterilize male pests that are then released to compete
    with wild males. When the sterile males mate with females, no offspring are produced
    and the population numbers crash. However, many species cannot be sterilized using
    irradiation and remain competitive when released. The solution provided in this
    project is to hard-wire male-sterility into the genome of the target organism
    using modern tools in precision genome editing. The approach has been validated
    in laboratory organisms, and that the required components are functional in insects,
    fish, plants, and mammals. Additionally, computer simulation modeling has been
    encouraging and suggest this approach is more robust than other technologies that
    rely on genome editing.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to replace plastic structural foam from non-sustainable sources with structural foam made with up-cycled shrimp shell waste.  Polymer foams are an important component of many modern technologies from construction to automotive as well as packaging and sporting goods.  Non-sustainable structural foam is a $350 billion/year market comprised mainly of polyurethane and polystyrene (styrofoam). Polyurethane and polystyrene require 500 years to degrade and create 30% of land-fill waste. It has been predicted that by 2050 there will be more plastic than fish in the ocean. Natural materials are an attractive alternative for producing polymer foams, but often they lack the required mechanical properties or appropriate processing. Our technology transforms the biopolymer, chitin, contained in seafood waste into foam using a water-based environmentally friendly process. The resulting natural foam is less costly to produce and closely matches the properties of polystyrene and polyurethane foams.


    This I-Corps project will examine costumer discovery data from potential customers in various structural foam markets to find the best market fit and identify the unfulfilled needs for sustainable structural foam. During the regional I-Corps course, we completed interviews with surfboard shapers, surfboard manufacturers, professional surfers, and other sustainable industry experts related to surfboards who have validated the value of having sustainable and biodegradable foam for use as the core material in surfboard construction. We plan to further explore other potential industrial applications for our sustainable and biodegradable foam. We will interview project and business managers from innovation research departments within industries such as packaging, transportation, and construction to determine product-market fit for these applications. The goal being to find the best fit for the technology in the global polymer foams market.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to significantly improve end-users' data analysis productivity and result accuracy. The Resource Enhancement and Advanced Discovery System (READS) technology streamlines users approaches to locating the most relevant analytic tools for their specific problems through natural language capabilities.  While focusing on geoscientists, financial analysts, and biotechnologists as potential users at the inception of this I-Corps project, READS can be customized for any discipline and its specific data analytic tool requirements.  The three user examples listed above are only the beginning of the potential applications for which this analytic tool discovery system can be utilized.  The ability to query resources with discipline-specific language and increase result accuracy by annotating the queried resources with domain-specific terminology will drastically reduce the amount of time required to locate requisite tools, and ultimately attract users.  New users will not need to start from scratch in their analyses, but will be able to build upon the resources discovered by others, therefore maximizing productivity.  This broad range of appeal, combined with an accessible user interface not seen in other tools, underscores the potential for significant commercial impact of this technology.

    This I-Corps project   aims to assist users in easily locating the "best" analytic tools for their specific task through an analytic tool discovery system for interdisciplinary data analysis. Data manipulation challenges are emerging and the integration of dataset analytic tools into a comprehensive framework is needed to further knowledge discovery.  Abundant tools and methods are available to the research and business communities to analyze datasets across disciplines, but it is often difficult to locate the most relevant tools for a specific task. Adding context to queries greatly enhances a users' ability to retrieve requisite analytic tools.  READS integrates analytic tool information into a one-stop-shop retrieval system capable of accessing valuable metadata from multiple repositories.  The system allows end-users to retrieve analytic tool information by submitting either keyword-based queries and/or free text-based questions.  The system leverages natural language processing, text mining, and an ontology-based metadata annotation system to allow collections of analytic tools and methods to be linked and discovered with high accuracy.  This allows end-users to discover, reuse, validate, share, and exchange knowledge related to their chosen data analytic tools. This novel approach facilitates the accessible analysis of cross-domain datasets, greatly enhancing end-users' ability to more efficiently answer challenging questions.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project stems from a cheaper method to convert solar energy into electrical power. While the solar energy industry is booming, its share of the total energy market is well below 1% whereas oil, natural gas, and coal is used for 85% of total energy consumption. The exhaustion of oil and gas supplies is ever growing near, and the negative environmental impacts caused from these energy sources is of great concern. Solar power is an excellent alternative energy source, but the technology involved can be costly. This project's solar cell embedded coating is substantially cheaper than traditional solar panels and can be implemented onto structures where solar panels would not be feasible. Application of this coating onto standard roofing materials provides an economical way to take advantage of solar energy.

    This I-Corps project is for the commercialization potential of perovskite solar cells. The perovskite material is tin based, as opposed to the traditional, toxic lead-based variety. The lifetime of the perovskites is extended by the elimination of oxidation through encapsulating the perovskite solar cells at the atomic layer through our proprietary carbon bonding nanotechnology. These perovskite solar cells can be embedded into a coating to add solar energy capabilities to other materials. This technology expands the frontiers of nanoscience to address several core academic challenges: expanding the use of graphitic nanosystems into functional materials, developing alternative technologies to make solar power the dominant source of commercial energy in the United States, and providing skills of delivering this intellectual property into the marketplace through the I-Corps program.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will make cutting edge cell therapies more affordable and accessible for a larger patient population. Cell therapies are among the most promising treatments for life-threatening diseases, such as cancer and severe immunodeficiency. While these cell therapies have been recently FDA approved, they remain extremely expensive, with single treatment costing hundreds of thousands of dollars. Manufacturing cell therapies requires expensive reagents and facilities and highly skilled labor, which drives up healthcare costs and makes cell therapies unattainable for many patients in greatest need. This I-Corps project aims to revolutionize the field of cell therapy manufacturing with an innovatively low-cost cell processing technology. This approach can efficiently modify normal cells into potent cell therapies and isolate desired cell populations for quality control. It benefits from low cost operation and eliminates the need in expensive skilled personal. This technology has a great potential to usher in a new era of affordable cell therapies and cost-effective healthcare.

    This I-Corps project utilizes a microfluidic platform that can sort and engineer cells with little to no impact on cell viability and function. Instead of relying on expensive and dangerous methods such as viruses or electric shock, the approach relies on natural cell response to rapid compressions to cause the processed cells to uptake molecules that can turn cells into life-saving cell therapies. This uptake can also be used to deliver labels to the cell interior to indicate desirable or undesirable cell traits for an easy and rapid readout for quality control. The entire technology is housed on a microfluidic chip that can process over 100,000 cells per second. The technology for cell sorting makes use of inherent cell mechanical properties and does not require any additional chemical or biological cell modification. This microfluidic platform can perform tasks that are normally extremely complicated, such as cell engineering, cell labeling, and cell sorting, providing efficient and cost-effective solutions for both making cell therapies and processing them into safe, high-quality treatments.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to improve electricity access for island communities and enable cost-effective restoration of coastal energy systems following natural disasters. Grid-weak regions and island communities typically have poor access to affordable, resilient, and clean energy solutions compared to their mainland counterparts. The frequency and severity of natural disasters is increasing; resilient and flexible electricity supply systems are more critical than ever, especially for island communities. Making effective recovery decisions addresses the different strategies of preparedness for energy systems and can drastically improve resulting economic and community impacts. This project will enable the efficient transmission of energy to island communities through a new technology, mobile energy storage transmission (MEST). The recent improvements of energy storage technology cost, size, and performance have resulted in technoeconomic feasibility of this innovative technology. Implementation of MEST will both improve long-term energy access for island communities and provide rapidly-deployable, flexible, affordable, and resilient electricity delivery systems for short-term crises. The advent of MEST coincides with the increasing importance of island energy systems; a market earmarked for high-growth over coming decades as sea levels rise, island nations continue to develop, and emphasis is put on development of sustainable energy systems.

    This I-Corps project is based on findings which identified a significant challenge in addressing the interdependency between infrastructure systems, in particular, pertaining to the role that energy systems play in the disaster recovery process of other infrastructures and communities. The proposed investigation addresses a missing link between resilience of infrastructure networks and multi-industry impacts to more effectively guide preparedness and recovery decisions. This project will evaluate scenario-specific applications of MEST for island communities; complementing the shortcomings of conventional cabled transmission. While on-shore cabled transmission is an efficient and low-cost mode of transporting electricity, subsea cabled transmission is costly and often results in poor redundancy of electricity supply. This novel transmission model, comprised of commercially available components, uses batteries and conventional freight transportation to move electricity from one market to another; providing service commensurate to a subsea cabled interconnector, but with added flexibility, resilience, and many benefits of traditional grid-level energy storage systems. MEST is founded on established economic theory, energy storage technology, and various market data. Research indicates potential for MEST in both long-term island power provision and short-term disaster relief. The combination of these findings indicates a promising future for impact and commercialization of MEST following this I-Corps project.

    enable global aspects of: 5th Generation cellular, manufacturing's industry 4.0
    automation and data exchange, connected and autonomous vehicles, and smart cities
    3.0 initiatives, focusing on improving the positioning capability of wireless
    transceivers. The connected vehicle market alone is expected to be valued over
    $22 billion by 2022 as the demand for accurate positioning data grows with the
    deployments of autonomous vehicles. A key economic driver for these initiatives
    is to generate new use-cases in delivering accurate real-time positioning for
    end-user applications. In the global market of positioning data, accurate estimation
    of user equipment location will be crucial for new communication systems. By enabling
    next generation wireless systems to determine their positions locally with respect
    to each other, any reliance on Global Positioning System (GPS) accuracy and availability
    may be decoupled from their operational requirements. This will not only provide
    real-time safety applications for end-users, but also allow new mobile broadband
    services in areas where GPS is degraded, such as in dense urban cities. \n \nThis
    I-Corps project seeks to determine the feasibility of a new smart antenna for
    next generation wireless systems. The smart antenna leverages low-cost antenna
    manufacturing and consolidated electrical circuits, to communicate a special protocol
    to next generation wide-band radios. This protocol, which has already been developed
    and proof-of-concept-ed, is the key enabler to making this new smart antenna provide
    direction-of-arrival-estimation per frame of wide-band communication networks.
    This project's product is comprised of a single smart-antenna accompanied with
    support software that provides a single-channel radio with localization capabilities.
    Currently, accurate real-time localization is only capable using multiple-antennas
    and cumbersome signal processing algorithms which may not be portable into existing
    hardware. With the new smart antenna, a radio can maintain above 90% packet delivery
    rates, while performing angular estimation of the received frame. Through a customer
    discovery process with key stakeholders in the communications field, this new
    smart antenna may prove to provide true direction-of-arrival-estimation on radio
    platforms which currently are not able to provide such functionality. A go/no-go
    market decision is expected at the completion of the I-Corps program.\n\nThis

    to provide effective aerial sensing solution for indoor environments. Persistent
    environmental monitoring, infrastructure inspection, and security surveillance
    are essential for large indoor facilities to provide safety and comfort. Existing
    aerial sensing solutions are mainly for outdoor applications. They are not suitable
    for human-occupied indoor environments due to short flight duration, disturbing
    noise level, and safety concerns. The proposed technology is based on specially
    designed robotic blimps that offer long flight duration, quiet sound profile,
    and safety for collision. The technology can potentially fill the market vacancy
    for indoor aerial sensing. In addition to indoor aerial sensing, the robotic blimps
    can also be marketed as a research and teaching tool for researchers, teachers,
    students, and hobbyists who are interested in performing indoor experiments on
    human friendly flying robots. The robotic blimps may also be extended to serve
    as companion robots for the elderly, or as intelligent toys for children. \n\nThis
    I-Corps project explores the commercial potential of an aerial sensing solution
    that is developed around a robotic blimp. The blimp is cushioned with Helium-filled
    envelope, and can fly safely among people. Buoyancy from the Helium gas helps
    reduce the power consumption of the blimp, enabling it to operate quietly for
    hours. Unique aerodynamic shape of the blimp ensures high maneuverability in indoor
    environments. The blimp represents an integration of research efforts in mechatronic

    by rapid and sensitive detection of infectious agents and automated data-logging.
    The commercial impact of the detection system leverages current smartphone capability
    in concert with advances in imaging, microfluidics, and enhanced computation to
    deliver detection of multiple important human pathogens all within a portable

    workers, clinicians, nurses, and procurement officials within governmental and
    aid organizations. \n\nThis I-Corps project integrates the smartphone with external
    hardware and disposable microfluidic chips to enable a portable pathogen detection
    platform. The intellectual merit of the project stems from the implementation
    of newly developed particle diffusometry technology, an optical-based method that
    quantifies the Brownian motion of particles within a fluid. Combining particle
    diffusometry with nucleic acid-based DNA amplification methods that are standard
    for point-of-care device industry allows for order of magnitude increases in the

    occurs and causes a decrease in the motion of particles in the sample solution
    that is imaged by the smartphone camera/external hardware microscope lens system.
    A smartphone application performs all of the quantitative computation, providing
    both detection results and immediately logging the data. Data can be readily pushed

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to address the urgent need of highly durable and more comfortable foot orthoses to benefit military service members and veterans, athletes, as well as other professionals suffering from foot or ankle injuries. The team has developed a nitinol-based foot orthoses. Compared to the current foot orthoses that are made of nonmetallic materials, the nitinol-based foot orthoses can provide enhanced functional capabilities including optimized energy dissipation capacity, improved comfort, long functional life, and lightweight. The life expectancy of the nitinol orthoses is twice as long as that of the plastic orthoses. The foot orthotic insoles market is currently estimated to be worth $2.6B and will grow to $3.7B by 2021. Thus, commercialization and application of the proposed foot orthoses will greatly impact the footwear industry. This project is the beginning of a new science and technology based company that will enhance the technology infrastructure and upon completion provide jobs for the STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) workforce of the state of Mississippi.

    This I-Corps project will explore the market potential of the novel foot orthoses previously developed by the team. The foot orthoses are made of nitinol using additive manufacturing methods. Their cellular structure generated during the additive manufacturing process can absorb more shock energy from every step a customer takes, therefore offering adjustable cushioning and comfort to the customer. Due to the shape-memory property and superelasticity of nitinol, the designed foot orthoses are easier to deflect under human body-support interaction forces, and can withstand corrosive environments and fatigue loading conditions. This I-Corps project aims to evaluate the market opportunities of the developed foot orthoses to gain a clear identification of market of the technology, as well as a deeper insight into the needs of potential customers. Discoveries from this project will inform the decision of the next step towards a startup and commercialization.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to facilitate the development of a versatile point-of-care (POC) biosensor for decentralized laboratory testing, and to investigate the market potential for early detection of protein biomarkers for diseases. The focus areas are in cardiovascular disease, breast milk banks, and assisted living facilities. There is a need for early diagnosis of heart failure, especially myocardial infarction, by monitoring cardiac biomarkers. This is not only for the patient's survival, but also reducing treatment costs. This biosensor technology will potentially be the first product on the market for a portable, rapid and cost-effective diagnosis of cardiovascular disease (CVD). This project may accelerate POC diagnostics research and personalized medicine, including early detection and screening, clinical diagnosis, treatment, prevention and control. Thus, it will permit a more effective deployment of therapies. The developed product is expected to find broader commercial applications including, but not limited to, preclinical and clinical researchers, life science studies, hospital and healthcare facilities, diagnostics and patient monitoring, home and remote use, as well as drug discovery in pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry.

    This I-Corps project will explore the market potential for the innovative biosensor. The end product will be a lab-on-a-chip based POC technology for use in complex biological media, like whole blood, which commonly requires sample pretreatment and/or separation of the large blood cells. The POC device will provide exclusive delivery of protein biomarkers (e.g. troponin) to the detection area for highly sensitive and reliable detection from a drop of whole blood. The uniqueness of the innovation lies in the nanoscale structures that are fabricated into thin metal films and integrated with microfluidics for direct optical measurement. The combination of on-chip/in-line sample preparation and fluid handling integrated with a simple, label-free, optical detection system enables a complete lab-on-chip system. This system may offer several advantages over conventional biomarker detection methods for use in complex samples. These include high throughput, high sensitivity, elimination of interferences from large blood cells, lower cost, ease of operation and simplified sample pretreatment. The I-Corps project attempts to explore innovative applications of parallel, multiple biomarker analysis and determine the readiness to transition the biosensor to a viable product.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will provide the manufacturing industry with an approach to identify and detect cyber-physical attacks within their production environments in real-time. Currently, the manufacturing industry is operating production systems vulnerable to malicious attacks, which may cause produced parts to not meet intended design requirements. Such a deviation from design intent could result in damaged products, loss of customer trust, and potentially injure employees and/or customers. The adoption of the proposed approach will secure manufacturers from cyber-physical attacks and create a strong supply chain. This will allow manufacturers to continue to produce sensitive parts both for the general public and the defense industry, increasing the difficulty of a malicious attack to affect part production. Through successful completion of this program, the I-Corps team will further develop awareness in this area through mentoring graduate students and discussing cyber-physical security with manufacturers across the United States.

    This I-Corps project employs both traditional decision analysis and data analysis techniques to identify and detect malicious events within manufacturing systems. This is done through a two-phase approach. First, a cyber-physical vulnerability assessment is completed which highlights areas within the production environment susceptible to malicious attack. Employing decision trees and process mapping, the vulnerability assessment is used to provide a high level overview of the cyber-physical resiliency of a manufacturing facility. Second, the proposed detection approach consists of an air-gapped sensor suite which can be placed on any piece of critical equipment to detect malicious events in real-time. The proposed approach analyzes side-channel measurements independent of the machine such as power consumption, vibration, and sound to identify anomalies within the process. Through performing the vulnerability assessment and implementing the proposed sensor suite, the entire production facility can be secured from malicious cyber-physical attacks intended to reduce part quality and/or sabotage produced parts.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will be to provide a fabrication system to companies manufacturing and/or developing cell based models for sale and/or service, pharmaceutical companies, and research organizations.  The platform will allow these entities to prototype and scale quicker, fail faster, and reduce costs of commercialization. Companies often must completely reengineer their fabrication process when scaling or changing their models. With this system, they can more rapidly iterate through potential designs. Decreasing the time to develop new cell based models will benefit the public and companies in this important and growing field. In addition, the technology can have an impact in analyzing/ranking potential drug candidates for pharmaceutical companies.

    This I-Corps project is based on techniques used to rapidly prototype inorganic metallic electronics commonly called laser induced forward transfer.  The system integrates laser direct write and laser micromachining (additive and subtractive techniques, respectively) for the manipulation and prototyping of biomaterials on a micron scale. Cells/biomaterials can be precisely transferred to a substrate using laser-assisted direct write. Before and/or after the transfer of 1-1000's of cells/units, the substrates can be shaped using laser ablation to create cell-scale geometries. Alternating addition and subtraction of (bio)materials in a controlled and repeatable way on a micron scale allows for the creation of cellular constructs in almost any geometry and gradient of chemical factors. A goal of this I-Corps project is to determine the commercial potential for the technology as a platform and/or as a service.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is in enabling new location-based services by using Bluetooth low energy (BLE) beacons in several important market verticals such as public transportation, retail, and events management, to name just a few.  BLE beacon-based software solutions can provide low-cost location-based services in both indoor and outdoor locations, supporting, for example, automatic foot traffic counts and location-based product promotions. As an emerging Internet of Things (IoT) technology, BLE beacons have the potential to become the leading proximity technology. However, the pros and cons of using these technologies in different settings are still not fully understood. For instance, privacy issues regarding location sharing in public spaces can impede the adoption of these technologies. This I-Corps project will explore implementation and commercialization opportunities of beacon-based technologies in airports, business conferences, and retail stores. The success of this project can help promote the adoption of this IoT technology and result in improved efficiency in public services and enhanced quality of people's daily lives.

    This I-Corps project will identify the commercial potential for using Bluetooth low energy (BLE) beacon technology to provide new and low-cost location-based services. A BLE beacon actively broadcasts Bluetooth signals, which can be received by nearby Bluetooth-enabled smartphones. Thus, mobile applications can leverage the beacons that are installed at different locations to detect people's movements, for instance, sensing when people enter or exit certain locations, and estimating the number of people co-located at certain locations. Effective beacon-based solutions need to address the following: ensure accurate movement detection when different beacons' Bluetooth signals interfere with each other; provide a scalable service where a large number of beacons can be supported by different mobile platforms; and include privacy-preserving features to address people's privacy concerns. This project will lead to a better understanding of varying requirements for beacon-based location services and how they might be customized to potentially service a variety of market verticals.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to develop technology that improves healthcare data infrastructure. Digital health has reached an inflection point. The FDA recently issued new guidelines for "Software as Medical Device" (SaMD) which is accelerating the development of clinical-grade connected devices. In recent months, investors poured $815 million into digital health and health sensor startups. The rise in digital biomarkers and biosensors present an opportunity to make significant changes in the way that care is monitored and delivered. Some relatively inexpensive tools that collect health data can make "precision medicine" a reality. However, current tools are not optimized for a large influx of data and there is a need for better infrastructure to be able to securely store and access data and to develop algorithms on these new datasets.

    This I-Corps project uses blockchain-derived protocols to improve the way digital health information is stored and accessed. A blockchain is an open database (e.g., a distributed ledger) maintained by a network of independent participants. This blockchain protocol is designed for trustless, peer-to-peer exchange without a central authority. Each digitally-connected sensor is a separate node (participant) in the protocol. As a patient generates new data, the sensor records the information, and creates a time-stamped summary in the distributed ledger. The blockchain provides assurance that the research queries are tamper-proof and have an auditable history across a wide range of actors in the system. The goal for the I-Corps participation is to best understand the systems and features the clinical data scientists are looking to as they develop next-generation clinical decisions and algorithms.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is twofold:  it lowers cost and knowledge barriers for smaller companies and startups which need to run scientific simulations, and it reduces time to market for product design firms by allowing faster, more integrated access to simulation tools and data. This project provides an end-to-end, user-oriented, cloud computing infrastructure that embraces the needs of all three critically involved stakeholders: users, model/tool providers, and computational resource providers. The cloud model has proved to be a cost effective, reliable solution to many information service challenges, and a cloud-based platform for scientific simulation and computation has the potential to impact the high-tech community by inducing a fundamental shift in the way scientific simulation and data are used. Small companies, especially emerging startups, need not invest in simulation software, but instead can utilize an extensive simulation ecosystem for product design. Companies with access to this platform will become less restricted by local computational resources, and more productive with a larger suite of simulation tools to solve design problems.

    This I-Corps project is based on a comprehensive infrastructure to host and execute scientific simulations and store and access the output data with ease. With multiple simulation codes available in one place, workflows can be created which use the output of one tool to provide input to the next. This modular approach enables users to combine different tools and customize the workflow to their own needs. Simulation outputs are all stored and the resulting scientific data can be mined for knowledge. User actions are also recorded and analyzed to enhance the user experience. Through customer discovery activities within I-Corps and continued requirements gathering from existing and potential communities, this cloud-based simulation platform will potentially change how researchers, students, educators, and industry practitioners engage with simulation and data on a day-to-day basis.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to create a product that will facilitate assessment of transportation fuels to ensure they will pass fuel specification tests. In particular, the project will provide a device that producers can use to more accurately determine whether their fuels will meet the specifications for soot/smoke emissions and should create a framework that allows fuel specifications for particulate matter (PM) emissions to be defined more precisely. This will benefit the fuels industry by reducing costs and increasing certainty. It will also enable them to confidently introduce alternative fuels that have lower PM emissions.

    This I-Corps project further develops an instrument that characterizes the sooting propensity of a fuel by its soot luminosity. Unlike the methods currently in use, this technology allows a quantitative measurement to be fully automated and performed online. It will deliver more accurate results faster than existing qualitative methods while requiring less sample. Extensive academic research has verified that this approach correctly detects the effect of fuel composition on PM emissions.  This I-Corps project will explore the commercial potential of this instrument across a variety of potential customer segments.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is based on significant improvements in accuracy and cost reduction of eye-related disease diagnosis by providing a high-quality, high-speed tissue imaging solution. Specifically, the project will shorten clinical scan time, and as a result, increase image resolution while reducing the number of required patient clinic visits. These improvements directly lower associated medical costs. The project goal is to create a new-generation of Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), a technique that is used in the clinical practice to provide cross-sectional images of the retina.  Currently, the biggest challenge faced by OCT clinical applications is their slow scan speed, which leads to low image resolutions and therefore unsatisfying clinical experience. A high-quality, high-speed signal processing tool is needed for reliable clinical decision-making and disease monitoring with OCT systems.

    This I-Corps project will further develop a new-generation of Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT).  The I-Corps project will explore the commercial potential of the innovation, a system capable of decreasing the signal processing time of swept source OCT (SS-OCT) devices by up to ten times according to lab tests. This device is based on a family of novel signal processing algorithms that significantly improve the accuracy and speed required for the medical images to be acquired. The SS-OCT platform will be enhanced in terms of the image acquisition speed, accuracy, and cost. This, in turn, will decrease the number of visits a patient needs to make to an ophthalmology clinic while increasing the overall clinic capacity to attend visiting patients per day, generating more revenue for those centers.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to improve the quality of life and care for people living with complex, chronic skin conditions like psoriasis. This I-Corps project will allow customer discovery research for a novel mobile-based imaging system for the automatic objective assessment of psoriasis lesions and management of the treatment. The solution developed here provides a personalized chronic disease management which objectively assesses the disease progression and improves accessibility to clinical professionals as needed toward next-generation patient management systems. Psoriasis is an incurable skin disease affecting millions in the US who often suffer from severe physical pain, discomfort, social isolation, and psychological distress. This I-Corps project provides an objective evaluation of disease improvement that will enable physicians to keep track of treatment efficacy for various systemic and biologic treatments for each patient. It will potentially help the approval process for new treatments for dermatological diseases by simplifying the process of disease evaluation during clinical trials. It will provide patient empowerment for taking control and preventing disease progression and improve treatment adherence thus reducing economic burden for the patients and the health system.

    This mobile-based imaging system includes a mobile app that utilizes a unique image processing and skin analysis algorithm that captures consistent calibrated images and specifies the severity level of the disease. The system determines Psoriasis Severity Index Score (PASI), a clinically accepted psoriasis scoring method, as a quantitative measure and based on clinical guidelines provides a descriptive measure (mild, moderate, or severe) to the user. It will work with different classifications of psoriasis disease, different skin types and under varying light conditions. It is developed based on extensive research in image processing techniques through extraction of features that efficiently capture the information about variations in color, texture and border irregularities of the diseased skin. Cloud based processing and storage of disease severity information over time enable automatic tracking of disease progression and associated prescription mapping provides the ability to assess the efficacy of the treatment. In addition, to improve the clinical diagnosis of psoriasis a multimode hyperspectral dermatoscope is used to accurately map the distribution of skin melanin and hemoglobin.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to allow individuals who are blind and visually impaired (BVI) to perceive images better than they currently can. Current technologies are insufficient since they only provide very little data to the user through tactile methods. Through the Multimodal image perception system (MIPS), students who are BVI will be able to perceive images through alternate sensory channels such as haptic, sound and tactile feedback. This would enable them to be active participants in exploration of STEM subjects such as biology or chemistry which rely heavily on understanding images. The use of this system would also allow individuals with BVI to overcome the stigma and fear of pursuing STEM majors as college students. Moreover, according to surveys by the Department of Education individuals with STEM majors often had higher paying jobs as compared to non-STEM majors. The use of the MIPS may promote their participation in STEM fields, which would allow individuals with BVI to pursue higher paying careers and promote diversification of the workforce by making individuals with BVI more economically competitive.

    This I-Corps project will contribute to addressing the improvement in the education for individuals who are blind and visually impaired (BVI). Experiments have been conducted with individuals with BVI to compare their understanding of images with the multimodal image perception system (MIPS), and with conventional systems such as tactile images. Through these experiments, it has been identified that the individuals who are blind have a better accuracy and understanding of images using the MIPS as compared to using the tactile images. Through the I-Corps program, the team will further investigate the most critical needs of the end users and determine the most optimal path towards commercializing the technology to allow it to be used by educators around the country to improve their students' understanding of STEM fields.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is in resolving the long-standing graphical access problem for millions of blind and visually-impaired (BVI) people. Lack of access to these substantial informational components of daily life represents one of the biggest challenges to the independence and productivity of BVI individuals. This project addresses this vexing accessibility issue through a viable information access solution built on commercial, low-cost touchscreen-based smart computing devices such as smartphones and tablets. The solution will assist BVI people by potentially providing dynamic access to digital school books and test materials, graphics in vocational settings, digital maps, and graphical contents of printed materials.  The broader impact of this project is that it will promote empowerment of BVI individuals by supporting increased educational advancement, vocational opportunities, enhanced quality of life, and overall greater independence.

    This I-Corp project will explore the commercial potential and market fit for a touchscreen-based graphics screen reader. This solution will allow blind people to freely explore and access graphical information via vibration and auditory feedback on a smartphone or tablet. Through a battery of usability, psychophysical, and technical experiments, the technology has been shown to be effective compared to existing solutions and is accurate in conveying informative graphical materials such as graphs, shapes, patterns, and indoor maps. The focus of the proposed I-Corp project is to understand the commercial fit and usability of the solution in meeting end-user needs and problems.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is that the project facilitate the design and operation of electromagnetic telemetry for underground wireless communication in oilfield measurement-while-drilling (MWD) and logging-while-drilling (LWD). The performance of an electromagnetic telemetry system is heavily dependent on electrical properties of the underground formation, as well as the deployment of downhole and surface antennas. Rigorous electromagnetic full wave simulations are critical in design, development, and deployment of an electromagnetic telemetry system for a drilling job. The modeling software package will potentially be the first product on the market with the capability of providing efficient 3D simulations of electromagnetic telemetry systems in complicated underground environments. Besides the oil and gas industry, electromagnetic telemetry can also be used in other important areas such as CO2 sequestration, deep borehole disposal of nuclear waste, and geothermal energy exploration.

    This I-Corps project explores the market potential of a 3D electromagnetic telemetry modeling tool for the oil and gas industry and other areas involving drilling activities. A realistic electromagnetic telemetry system is an extremely multiscale structure, and rigorously modeling such a system is beyond the capabilities of available commercial electromagnetic simulation tools. The proposed product is based on the recent advancement of computational electromagnetics algorithms using 3D integral equations with a novel coated thin wire model to simulate the metallic drill string and borehole environment in layered formation. The product as a modeling software can be several orders more accurate than existing commercial simulation tools for the analysis of electromagnetic telemetry systems. The goal of this I-Corps team is to investigate the market potential of this technology and related product in the oilfield and other relevant applicable areas.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is in the area of high quality capacitor solution to replace the bulky and lossy aluminum electrolyte capacitors (AECs), a ubiquitous circuit element used in power systems and electronics for current ripple filtering, decoupling, and pulse charging/discharging, among other purposes. Rising demand for high quality capacitors is driven by automotive, telecom, medical and commercial electronics, and by the rapid growth of process automation and internet of things (IoT) in the industrial sectors. The widely used AECs have a low volumetric capacitance density and high parasitic resistance. Their bulky size and high resistive loss limits the system size and performance. Therefore, developing new technologies of quality capacitors will have the opportunities to greatly improve the system performance. These systems and applications span from inverters and DC power suppliers for industry machines, electronic appliances and medical devices, mini and low-profile circuit boards, to efficient storage of the pulse energy harvested from the environmental mechanical vibration, motion, and noise, as well as high-frequency high-power pulse generators.

    This I-Corps project will explore the market potential of high-frequency AC supercapacitor technology for current ripple filtering in AC/DC conversion and for pulse energy storage in environmental energy harvesting. These supercapacitors based on the principle of electric double layer capacitance and therefore provide a very large capacitance density. However, unlike conventional double layer capacitors that can only be charged-discharged below a frequency of 1 Hz, the devices developed here run at hundreds to kilo-hertz high frequencies and therefore suitable for ripple current filtering and pulse energy storage and generation. The high-frequency characteristic of the device is achieved via nano-engineered carbon fiber and graphene electrodes with suitable pore sizes. This I-Corps project will evaluate the market opportunity of the AC supercapacitor technology through customer discovery interviews. The feedback from these activities will provide better understanding on the customer needs and commercialization requirements, and therefore drive the technology development.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to make quiet products and systems that have pipe and duct sound transmission.  Systems like automobile exhausts and intakes, building heating and ventilation systems, and fluid flow piping all transmit sound from power generating equipment to human receivers. In order to reduce the amount of noise to which people are exposed, passive and active noise control systems are incorporated in pipe and duct systems. These systems are currently large, heavy and inefficient. The application of a compact and lightweight coaxial active noise control system has potential implications on many industries where size of noise control elements constrain design. More importantly, the reduction of noise in the environment has potential health and wellness benefits for all members of society through environmental stress reduction. Reducing noise emitted from mechanical pipe and duct systems is an important step in reducing overall environmental noise exposure.

    This I-Corps project explores the market need for coaxial thermophones (or heat-driven solid state speaker), particularly those manufactured using carbon nanotube (CNT) thin films. The idea of a thermophone was developed as early as 1898. However, practical applications of the thermophone have not been realized. This is mainly due to lack of low heat capacity material to manufacture the thermophone. CNT thin-films enable an efficient thermophone due to their low heat capacity per unit area as well as their relatively low production cost. Current active noise control technologies rely on outdated moving coil transducer design, which limits their widespread implementation due to size, weight, cost, and performance restrictions. A coaxial thermophone transducer design reduces size and weight significantly while increasing potential noise control performance. This I-Corps national program will lead to better understanding of customer segments, value propositions, customer pain points, value chains, delivery methods, partnerships, and a minimum viable product.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is that it will potentially reduce fatal errors associated with compounded sterile preparations (CSP).  This will save lives and save money by preventing dose errors and wastage of costly medications and accessories when CSP's are incorrectly made. This I-Corps project will also explore similar problems that can also have life threatening consequences. The project will help to discern how various types of errors encountered in industrial processes can be minimized by integrating technology and human intervention at various workplaces. The product will help to gain understanding about how machines and people interact so as to design better workflow practices related to the CSP preparation and other relevant health care/industrial processes. The design of the technology allows usage in virtual simulation centers and other educational settings to train technical personnel, students, and professionals.

    This I-Corps project involves a computational decision support system (CDSS) product that was developed to address severe shortcomings in compounded sterile preparations (CSP).  Current procedures can result in fatal errors, inappropriate techniques, and noncompliance issues.  The first feature of the CDSS is an audio-visual interface for the compounding technician to identify and pick the correct materials and accessories to prepare a CSP. The second feature of the CDSS tracks, monitors, and evaluates the methods used by a technician compounding the injectable medication through image and video processing. The third feature of the CDSS checks and confirms the volume of a liquid injection contained in a syringe. The CDSS product can digitally document all the steps during this process enabling real time feedback during compounding so that errors can be corrected immediately. The technology also records the techniques used during compounding to ensure that proper procedures were followed according to regulatory guidelines. The CDSS thus provides timely warnings and real time feedback during preparation of a CSP and documents all aspects of the process that can be fully integrated with quality assurance (QA) programs.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to explore the opportunities of using a new technology to help manufacturers make carbon fiber composite products with higher production speed and lower cost. This novel fabrication technology produces materials that are stronger, stiffer, thinner, lighter, and better conductors of heat and electricity than current carbon fiber composites widely used in manufacturing industries. Parts produced from these new materials are more accurately made and have less internal stress remaining after manufacturing than previously. In addition, this technology will also reduce the energy consumption and material waste during the operation of vehicles and equipment that utilize them. Since carbon fiber composites are being increasingly used in many industries including aerospace, automotive, energy, marine, sporting goods, and defense, successful commercialization of the new technology catalyzed by this I-Corps project will bring significant benefits to the U.S. manufacturing base.

    This I-Corps project is based on a new technology using long ultra-thin carbon nanofibers to thread through a bed of conventional thicker carbon fibers all surrounded by an epoxy resin adhesive. As a result, the thicker fibers are strongly bound together by the nanofibers, and all are held in place by the epoxy, to produce a composite material that is much stronger than either the epoxy resin alone or the conventional carbon fiber composite including the epoxy. This is called "z-threading". The network of interlocked carbon nanofibers and carbon fibers significantly improves the composite material's strength and conduction of heat and electricity. Conventional carbon fiber composite materials, typically in the form of a laminate, lack the z-threading nanofibers and have significantly poorer properties across the thickness direction of the laminate. As a result, manufacturing processes currently using carbon fiber composites will be significantly improved. This will allow production of more aggressively designed components with higher performance than has been possible before.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the practical deployment of a computer-vision based yield estimation system in fruit orchards.  With this technology, the farmers will be able to obtain a map of the number  and size of fruit across their farms from images recorded by a standard camera. This capability will provide farmers with a useful tool in planning their harvest and sales, as well as in managing the long-term health of their plants.  It  will also potentially reduce the inherent risk in fruit growing, thereby improving the affordability and availability of fresh fruit in the US.  Furthermore, by allowing the adoption of precision agriculture techniques to high value crops, this project may help save water and contribute to reduction of runoff pollution from fertilizer and chemicals.

    This I-Corps project addresses the task of customer discovery for applications of the technology of vision-based yield detection and mapping in fruit orchards.  The core of the technology is a set of computer vision algorithms to detect fruit in images under natural farm conditions. This application presents several computer vision task challenges.  Fruit may be occluded by leaves and other fruit. Shadows and specularities make color information unreliable. Also, fruit across frames are matched to avoid double counting. Geometric algorithms are used for estimating fruit diameter. This I-Corps project will allow for customer discovery in this and other market spaces, test the product-market fit for the proposed yield estimation technology, and guide future  technology development in this area.

    The broader impacts and commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the progress toward developing a treatment delivery system for individuals with debilitating fears.  The system, based on augmented reality and virtual reality, addresses significant limitations of other treatment modalities. Approximately 9% of adults in the United States experience a clinically significant phobia that causes impairments in functioning at high cost to the individual and society. Despite the functional impairment caused by the debilitating fears characteristic of Specific Phobia, nearly 2/3rds of individuals do not seek treatment likely due to the aversive qualities of the most effective treatment, exposure therapy. Untreated, phobias can have significant economic impact on society. Therefore, the technology in this project has broader impacts to society by improving access to treatment through delivery through a more acceptable modality.  Customers are expected to be licensed mental health practitioners and the product will allow them to expose their patients to computer generated phobic stimuli via an augmented reality (AR) headset. The technology will allow clinicians to adopt a therapy delivery system that is more acceptable to clients, while reducing clinician time and overall treatment costs.

    This I-Corps project will involve conducting customer discovery interviews to test product-market fit for the development of an augmented reality (AR) platform that allows people to overcome debilitating fears characteristic of Specific Phobia. The project is based on research indicating that only a minority of individuals with this highly treatable disorder obtain intervention services because typically-delivered exposure therapy has highly aversive qualities. Approximately 1 in 4 patients reject the treatment when it is introduced. However, research also indicates that the same treatment delivered in virtual reality (VR) environments is a highly preferred therapy modality with a low rejection rate (3%). Unfortunately, this approach is not widely adopted by therapists because the time to create a complete VR environment with the fear stimulus is costly, resulting in poor product-market fit. With the rapid development of AR-based technology and the low-cost of rendering AR environments relative to VR environments, this I-Corps project offers the benefits of VR-assisted therapy (lower patient rejection rates/higher patient preference) while avoiding the barriers to clinician adoption.  This technology is expected to increase patient access to and engagement in treatment, while simultaneously reducing clinician time and costs spent preparing for individual exposure tasks.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is addressing the increasing demand for sustainable water purification and cost-effective phase separation with an energy-efficient, economical, portable and scalable solution. More than a billion people around the world lack access to clean drinking water. Most of the existing technologies for water purification and phase separation mainly use energy from conventional fuels increasing their operating cost and limiting their application. The proposed technology of Nanophotonics-enabled Solar Membrane Distillation (NESMD) uses solar energy to vaporize water and potentially other liquids of interest. NESMD system is energy-efficient, portable and can be scaled in size making it suitable for household, commercial and industrial water purification. Cost-effective phase separation with NESMD can be attractive for petroleum and related industries as well.

    This I-Corps project focuses on electricity-free water purification and phase separation. Nanophotonics-enabled Solar Membrane Distillation (NESMD) system consists of a polymer membrane coated with light-absorbing carbon-based nanomaterials which efficiently absorb incident sunlight. The capability of converting light into heat within a thin layer on top of a semipermeable membrane allows an efficient local conversion of liquid to its vapor phase. This membrane can be used in contact with saline/polluted water or a mixture of organic solvents allowing the heat from the absorbed sunlight to induce vaporization through the membrane separating the liquid of interest from non-volatile components such as salts, heavy metals, bacteria or other liquids. Proof-of-concept lab-scale studies of the NESMD system show efficient water purification with more than 99.5% salt rejection. Through this I-Corps project the team wants to further assess and investigate the value of this technology for water purification and phase separation market.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is an improvement in the safety of food products. In particular, this I-Corps project aims to identify a customer base for a novel biosensing technology using printed floating-gate transistors (FGTs). FGTs are a platform-technology that can be used to detect any analyte that can be captured using an antibody or a special sequence of single-stranded DNA, known as a DNA aptamer. The most likely direction for commercialization is gluten detection. The growing industry of gluten-free foods is valued at $2.8 billion/year. These foods are critical to people suffering from celiac disease, which affects 1% of the population. The FGT platform can also be adapted to other allergens, clinically relevant proteins, or even microorganisms. The continued advancement and commercialization of this technology thus has broader impacts in food safety, and potentially for biomedical and clinical environments.

    This I-Corps project is motivated by the development of a new transistor-based sensing strategy that combines printed electronic and microfluidic technologies. Existing transistor-based sensing technologies pose a difficult materials science problem, wherein the transistor material needs to have outstanding electronic properties as well as stability in the biosensing environment. In contrast, the sensor electronics in the technology under development here are decoupled from the fluidic environment through a side-gate architecture. Published research has established that this platform can detect DNA and proteins. It is thus a flexible platform for biosensing. The research in this project focuses on customer discovery to identify promising directions for commercialization. The initial customer discovery will focus on the food safety industry, with the aim of determining whether gluten detection is the optimal entry point to this market. Subsequent activities will broaden the customer discovery efforts to identify targets in the biomedical and clinical areas.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to develop a 3-dimensional view of agricultural fields using algorithms applied to remotely sensed imagery to help farmers enhance soil fertility and crop production while also protecting watersheds. From an economic perspective, farmers want to minimize expenditures on nutrients. There is a need by farmers to increase below ground drainage through installation of tiles, perforated plastic pipes, and thus increase production. Tile placement and integrity, coupled with existing data on soil type and characteristics, have a critical impact on the hydrology and fertility of fields, affecting plant growth, the need for fertilizer/nutrients, pesticide and other types of applications. Precise knowledge of a three dimensional view of the land will enable farmers to make appropriate decisions about the application of fertilizers, micro-nutrients, pesticides, etc. to minimize cost, maximize revenue and do as little harm as possible to the ecosystem in which the farm exists. Bringing together data layers of agricultural fields along with information on tile drains will allow the agricultural industry to optimize production through proper placement and repair of tiles while controlling nutrient use and loss.

    This I-Corps project uses remote sensing techniques with aerial imagery to provide information precisely identifying the location of drain tiles buried beneath farm fields. Farmers have expressed that knowledge of the location of tile reduces their costs when tile fail and need repair and also helps when additional tile are added to a field improving drainage. In previous work, it was found that fertilizers applied to agricultural fields will pass through the soil and exit a field through tile drains to the surface water system. This I-Corps project uses remote sensing algorithms to detect tile drains below the soil. The technique utilizes the reflectance of the soil as well as the linear shape expressed on the soil surface that indicates tiles within fields. The information generated through this project is unique and much needed by the agricultural industry to better utilize land in crop production "precision farming".

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a tissue engineering technology that will enable generation of cardiovascular (CV) tissue replacements capable of stretch and recoil, on demand and also on site regenerative repair of blood vessels which are structurally disrupted due to disease. The technology addresses the inability of current tissue engineering approaches to overcome poor ability of adult cells to generate the protein elastin that form the primary component of elastic fibers that provide tissues stretch properties. The proposed innovation is a reparative nanoparticle platform technology comprising antibody-targeted, biodegradable polymer nanoformulations with pro-elastin regenerative and anti-degradative properties. In this project, the technology will be initially validated in the context of treating abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs), which are localized expansions of the abdominal aorta wall resulting from irreversible elastic matrix breakdown. Through this I-Corps project, the team will assess the commercial viability of this technology, understand key market/customer needs and value propositions, explore partnership opportunities and gain regulatory insight towards generating a realistic business canvas for a commercial startup.

    This I-Corps project provides intellectual merit based on the transformative potential of a novel polymer nanoparticle delivery approach for onsite regenerative repair of disease compromised elastic tissues, which mimic the elastic matrix regenerative effects of stem cell secretions. The technology will first be tested in context of repairing abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA), since there are no FDA-approved pharmacologic treatments for AAAs, and elective surgery and stent grafting on small AAAs have high risk and no treatment benefit. The team will identify a minimum viable product based on regenerative nanoparticles comprising antibody-targeted biodegradable polymer matrices. The pro-elastin regenerative and anti-matrix degradative properties of these nanoparticles are independently provided by both the released active agents (biologic factors identified from adult stem cell derived smooth muscle cells) and chemically functionalized polymer matrix. If successful, the technology will provide realistic prospects to arrest or reverse growth of small AAAs soon after diagnosis, thus reducing need for surgery in these patients.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the identification of industrial users interested in harnessing olfactory receptor-based biosensors for the rapid detection of chemical and biological targets in the environment or complex aqueous systems.  Unambiguous detection of target chemicals in complex samples has the potential to improve water treatment processes, detect chemical threats in the field, and identify environmental pollutants. Precise detection of biologicals in complex samples has the potential to identify biomarkers for disease diagnosis, reveal contaminated food and water supplies, and alert to airborne pathogens in the environment. The large number of solutions that olfactory-receptor-based sensors have the potential to offer speaks to the large potential commercial impact of this technology.

    This I-Corps project leverages the proteins used in odor detection to generate chemical sensors that fluoresce upon chemical detection. To date, this technology has been used to generate biosensors with flouroescent readout to detect chemicals ranging from biofuels and environmental pollutants to pharmaceutical intermediates and perfumes. Among other applications, the sensors are being used to improve the performance of whole cell and enzyme biocatalysts for the improved production of chemicals.  This I-Corps project explores the commercial potential of the innovation to better define the technical requirements of olfactory-based biosensors in commercial applications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to provide accurate and timely precipitation forecasts for water resource management during rainfall and hydrological extremes including intense flooding and droughts events. This I-Corps team has developed a unique high resolution weather forecasting model using a high-performance computer framework that employed all available local weather observations and state-of-the-art local doppler radar data to improve local precipitation forecasts on a short-term basis. In conjunction with precipitation forecasts, our system will support water resources related decision-making. A web-based service to provide these pinpoint rainfall forecasts and other related hydrological data products will be available. Operations managers of businesses and government agencies (i.e., water districts, agricultural farms, insurance companies, energy companies) who rely on very accurate and precise rainfall forecasts to make economic-based decisions will be able to have quick access to customized rainfall forecasts and hydrological products at their user-defined locations. During short-term hydrological extremes, these pinpoint accurate rainfall forecasts and products will improve the efficiency and decision-making abilities within the companies and agencies themselves, and it will help them to better communicate their decisions to their end-users and the public.

    This I-Corps project will employ a high-resolution weather forecasting model. It can have a horizontal resolution of 1 km or finer and uses specific 3D-Variational data assimilation methods which incorporate all available real-time weather observations from multiple sources. These input sources include satellite data (e.g., GOES-R), weather station and rain gauge data, quantitative precipitation estimates from local doppler radars, and other global and regional forecasting models (e.g., NOAA?s High Resolution Rapid Refresh and North American Model). The model can be executed separately for any specific region and location of interest to the end-user, can extract pinpoint rainfall forecasts, and can be updated every 3 or 6 hours depending on the circumstance. Other hydrological products available from the project that can also assist in decision support such as drought conditions (e.g., soil moisture and drought severity indices) and water levels of local reservoirs. It is anticipated that the products from this high-resolution modeling and big-data system will provide guidance to support water management and consumption decisions for government agencies and the private sectors.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to obtain the benefits available from modernizing legacy processes in the made-to-order design manufacturing industry. Traditionally the mathematical processes used to analyze potential designs are very linear in nature, and do not offer the manufacturer a complete picture of the overall impacts of the non-linear parts of their designs. With the predictive engineering analysis tool developed here, a manufacturing facility can preview the results available from using a particular engineering design prior to the actual manufacturing and testing of the physical parts. Design parameters and environmental conditions can also be inserted into the tool which are then used to better predict the behavior of the part after it is produced. This innovative virtual tool has the potential to be added to the set of existing design and testing tools already being used and let manufacturers predict the success or failure of a part. The impact of this tool would be decreased time to market, eliminating the guesswork now used in certain aspects of a design and saving valuable physical resources.

    This I-Corps project defines an innovative scalable software tool that is capable of virtually predicting the success or failure of an engineering design prior to production. The technique is based on the mathematical modeling of the coordinated behaviors of biological system. This allows the tool to quickly search and intelligently predict the best solution sets to a multi-objective problem in a given design space. This project employs these innovative bio-inspired techniques to develop algorithms which are applied to engineering designs to produce an ideal set of solutions based on user defined objectives. Bio-inspired algorithms have been shown to improve upon current standard rigid mathematical techniques. This project provides the flexibility to implement an approach that is able to search the entire problem space at once therefore giving better visibility to all of the possible solutions. Since no particular parameter in isolation impacts the outcome of the algorithm, the user is presented with the opportunity to shift the input parameters and rerun the optimization.  Further this I-Corps project attempts to explore and define the input parameters for a variety of industries, and assist the end user in coming up with better designs for their products.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the application of high performance catalysts for use in energy conversion/storage devices such as fuel cells and batteries. Successful commercialization will considerably advance nano-manufacturing in electrochemical energy conversion/storage and have a positive impact on a number of clean energy technologies. Typical customers for the proposed innovation include a broad spectrum of high-tech industries which will potentially benefit from commercialization of this technology. Some examples include fuel cell manufacturers, automotive industry, consumer electronics and energy storage companies. Superior performance of novel amorphous catalysts compared to state of the art suggests that this technology might be attractive core strength for a new company. As such, this I-Corps program will seek to understand whether a market opportunity exists around application of this technology and any potential spin-out company.

    This I-Corps project is focused on addressing catalyst performance bottlenecks in energy conversion/storage technologies such as fuel cells and batteries. This will be achieved by replacing state of the art nanoparticle catalysts with novel amorphous metallic alloys. Metallic glasses are fully amorphous multi-component alloys with unique combination of properties and processing ability. They can be produced in a wide range of compositions that are not available in crystalline form and therefore their electronic and catalytic characteristics can be engineered to achieve superior performance. A self-supporting architecture will be used for these novel amorphous catalysts, which prevent the dissolution of support material and significantly improve durability. The success of this project will lead to commercialization of highly-efficient and low-cost catalytic materials for electrochemical energy devices. It will pave the way for new clean energy technology ventures.

    Through the NSF Innovation Corps for Learning Program (I-Corps L), this project will develop ways to increase the scale and impact of a tutoring, mentoring, and advising program to help community college students to complete Associate's degrees and successfully transfer to four-year institutions. Increasing the number and diversity of students entering, persisting and graduating with STEM degrees; and significantly aiding them with STEM internships and job placements is imperative to solving the critical national and state workforce deficit that encompasses 63 STEM occupations categorized by the U. S. Department of Labor. Improving STEM education pathways to engage and retain students in STEM programs requires creative interdisciplinary real world experiential learning strategies that integrate technology in delivering and reiterating content to 21st century learners.  Community colleges represent a special opportunity for increasing STEM majors. Two-year institutions are 'the entry point into higher education for most first-generation college students, particularly those from low-income, minority, and immigrant backgrounds'. Studies have shown that only 25 percent of these students complete a two-year degree and transfer to a four-year institution and only 17 percent complete a bachelor's degree. In 2000, the Baccalaureate and Beyond Community College Mentoring Program (BBCCMP) was founded to assist underrepresented minority, low income, and first generation community college students from six State University of New York (SUNY) community colleges with the transition from the two-year to four-year institutions and transitions either into the workforce or to graduate or professional school. The program involves tutoring, mentoring, and advising at the two and four-year institutions as well as a summer research program. In the almost fifteen years of the program, over 300 students have been involved. Over 80 percent of these students completed their Associate's degree and transferred to four-year institutions. Over 70 percent of these students are completing their bachelor's degree and 33 percent are going on for post-graduate work. This I-Corps for Learning project will develop ways to extend the impact of this program to other institutions throughout the country.

    The BBCCMP Program at Purchase College provides an extensive array of student supports. These begin when the student is recruited from the community college. Faculty coordinators at the community college identify and advise students who wish to enter the program. In addition, the program provides peer tutors and mentors at the community college. Students participate in a summer research program that not only provides research opportunities, but also has workshops on skills building, transferring, and career and post-baccalaureate opportunities. Students also participate in cohort and career building. In 2010 the SUNY Replication Project created a New York-based ecosystem in STEM based on the success of the Baccalaureate and Beyond Program within SUNY. Subsequently, six regional hubs comprising a mixture of two-year and four-year institutions were formed, and representatives met again at a second conference in 2012, to scale-up working with community colleges on student transitions. Through the NSF I-Corps initiative, this project will investigate sustainable methods to expand the success of BBCCMP to a larger number of institutions.

- abstractText: "The Los Angeles economy, the nation's second largest, is anchored
    by the health care, aerospace and defense industries. It is now also home to the
    rapidly growing Silicon Beach technology corridor, which spawns exciting new startups
    in software, digital and interactive media, renewable energy and a plethora of
    others. With one of the largest populations of graduating engineers in the country
    and a large manufacturing base, the Los Angeles region is ideally poised for a
    substantial transformation of its innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystem. The
    Los Angeles Regional I-Corps Node will help accelerate this transformation, by
    helping to increase the potential for leveraging the region's products and services.
    The University of Southern California led Node, consisting of a partnership between
    the University of Southern California, the University of California Los Angeles,
    and the California Institute of Technology, will improve the region's ecosystem
    by: modeling how to leverage regional strengths to support commercialization nationally;
    studying team and customer-network formation; aligning technology and organizational
    maturity paths; and determining institutional support mechanisms to accelerate
    team coalescence, technology-to-product transformation, and customer acquisition.
    The Node will contribute to the NSF's mission of empowering STEM students, technical
    professionals, researchers and entrepreneurs to actively and effectively translate
    innovative ideas into large-scale commercialization. Annual I-Corps training sessions
    will be created that combine the strength of the partner institutions to offer
    new regional entrepreneurial opportunities and contribute novel resources to the
    I-Corps National Innovation Network (NIN). Two efforts will specifically focus
    on extending the Lean Start-up model to established industries in the Los Angeles
    region. The first will focus on health-care engineering, including a 'Mobile Demo
    Day' that will educate researchers on the convergence of engineering and medicine,
    regulatory hurdles, insurance strategies, medical industry distribution models,
    and related issues. The second will focus on aerospace and defense; offering unparalleled
    access to insight, mentoring, and opportunities to technologists in this area,
    along with strategies that can be used to develop an alignment with large-scale
    system integrators. \n\nThe Node will provide a vibrant research center for commercialization
    processes and outcomes. It will examine founding team formation, the coalescence
    of engineering talent with business skills, and customer and alliance development
    that cultivates relationships with industry incumbents. The research will also
    focus on evaluating and improving entrepreneurial skills in technology maturity
    assessments, understanding the level of technology maturity required for industrial
    adoption, and identifying institutional support mechanism for accelerating commercialization.
    The hypothesis that technology and organizational maturity proceed along independent
    and often unsynchronized timelines will be tested to better understand their interactions
    and identify factors that will increase success. Data from investors, customers,
    and advisors will help provide an awareness of each entrepreneur's stakeholder
    network and recognize correlations involved with both the activity and duration
    of fundraising. In a similar vein, the Node will study the duration to first sales,
    acquisition of government grants, and other milestones in cash generation. These
    factors will be tied to technology development milestones in order to identify
    relationships and key drivers, such as the importance of prospective customers
    and investors in accelerating operational cash flow to the company (i.e., through
    sales, rather than financing). Short-term outcomes will contribute to an understanding
    of the relative importance of various roles and dependencies. Longer-term outcomes
    will contribute to an improvement in the performance of regional teams. The Node's
    website will contribute videos, slide decks, and related materials to the NIN,
    including a 'Needs and Deals' section where local deals that seek specialized
    guidance will be advertised. The website will also post bios and contact information
    for vetted mentors who can assist companies in other regions of the country."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is improvements in instrumentation for laparoscopic surgery. During surgery, scope vision may become impaired, requiring scope removal from the body and economic and medical disadvantages. Our technology helps mitigate the need of scope removal from the body by providing a cleaning mechanism. The commercial potential for this technology appears valid at this stage, with broad opportunity to address an established market need.

    This I-Corps project focuses on a technology that can be pictured as a tube, shaft, or long arm with a squeegee at its tip. Its main purpose is to serve as a cleaning mechanism for the far end of an elongated instrument. The intellectual merit of this technology allows for the exploration of cleaning technology application surrounding elongated instruments, with particular opportunity in the medical field. At this stage, proof of concept has been demonstrated with functional prototypes that show acceptable performance. There is particular use for applications where the elongated instrument is constrained within a narrow and/or deep cavity.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

  title: 'NSF I-Corps Proposal: Elongated Instrument Cleaner'
- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project targets
    treatment of ocular trauma, in particular corneal injuries. Ocular trauma treatment
    requires advanced surgical equipment and specialty surgical centers. The Corneal
    Transplant Market, currently at 40000 per year in the US is expected to grow at
    10.8% from 2017 to 2023. The project targets the wound care market of $18.22 billion
    (2016), expected to reach $26.24 billion (2023). The societal impact entails enabling
    rapid care provision to patients like soldiers in combat, to trauma and elderly
    and pediatric patients, as well as reduction of operative and post-operative costs.
    The technology can be extended to repairing tissues such as lung, liver, heart
    or kidneys, expanding its reach and medical benefits to larger populations. This
    novel chemistry platform aims toward tissue adhesion, but the chemistry could
    be slightly altered to make materials for a broader range of biomedical applications.
    Study of such novel material platforms, like understanding of structure-property
    relationships, offers numerous teaching and outreach opportunities involving students
    from subject disciplines spanning chemistry, material sciences, chemical, mechanical,
    and electrical engineering to biology. \n\n     This I-Corps project has developed
    a modified hydrogel to make antimicrobial, hemostatic and highly adhesive glue
    for surgical applications. This is a material platform to make cost-effective,
    sutureless, and user-friendly adhesives to heal injury to biological tissue and
    save operative and post-operative time and cost. The current primary needs for
    ocular trauma surgery entail operative and postoperative time and cost reduction.
    Currently, there are no such Food and Drug Administration-approved material platforms
    to replace the presently used techniques of suturing effectively. The material
    is expected to enjoy biocompatibility, biodegradability, no toxicity and excellent
    adhesion to tissues, even in the presence of body fluids. The platform may also
    aid in blood coagulation, facilitate healing and inhibit bacterial growth. This
    innovation will potentially circumvent the limitations of current surgical and
    post-operative approaches in corneal repair, and in the future may be extended
    to repair of other human tissues.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission
    and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
    intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

    based on its focus on promoting balanced human microflora. The project aims at
    commercial development of a novel prebiotic and probiotic skincare line to improve
    skin appearance and overall health. Considering the increasing recognition of
    the importance of microflora in human health and the growing demand for natural
    products, the focus is on developing prebiotic and probiotic skincare product
    lines to fit within the $10-billion+ organic beauty market. However, the approach
    has broader implications for the general skincare and healthcare markets. Currently,
    most treatments for skin conditions such as eczema and psoriasis ignore the bacterial
    component, instead utilizing harsh chemical and invasive solutions. If successful,
    efforts will ultimately shift toward more intrinsic and natural solutions that
    aid the body in healing itself, without contributing to further disruption of
    skin integrity. As the skin and its associated bacteria contribute to defending
    the body against environmental contaminants and foreign invaders, the approach
    also paves the way for novel prebiotic and probiotic products for promoting robust
    immune function. \n\nThis I-Corps project focuses on the use of skin-associated
    microorganisms to improve overall appearance and health. Beneficial bacteria exist
    on the human body, helping it function properly and protecting it from various
    diseases. The skin is the largest organ of the immune system and the first line
    of defense against toxins and pathogens; the presence of beneficial skin bacteria
    is essential not only for appearance, but also for overall human health. The bacteria
    exist on the skin as cooperating, surface-attached communities. A balance of specific
    bacterial species, as well as proper attachment to the skin, is essential for
    the protective beneficial functions of these communities. Disruption of the microflora
    balance and/or of bacterial attachment to the skin can result in a variety of
    disorders. To promote skin health, the investigators have identified specific
    beneficial skin bacteria, as well as factors that promote the establishment of
    the functional bacterial communities--in particular, naturally produced factors
    that promote the attachment of bacteria to biotic surfaces, such as the skin.
    Based on those results, they have developed a system to balance the skin microbiome
    that utilizes proprietary probiotic formulations containing live skin-associated
    bacteria and prebiotic factors, which promote the interactions of these bacteria
    with the skin.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is
    to eliminate the barriers to the trading of Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs)
    and to further accentuate the environmental and sustainability value of green
    energy production. A broad societal benefit of a national market for RECS (NaMaREC)
    is the increased adoption of renewable energy technology through projects such
    as community solar and wind farms leading to reduction in carbon footprints. This
    benefit is higher when the increasing need for energy due to growing populations
    is satisfied with more renewable energy. Renewable utilities will benefit from
    NaMaREC since it will allow them to expand their consumer base and reach consumers
    that may be willing to pay more for the certificate. Nonrenewable utilities can
    use NaMaREC to source RECs from cheaper regions, thus reducing their cost of compliance.
    Ultimately, NaMaREC will provide an avenue to communicate the economics of renewable
    energy adoption to the public through extensive interviews of potential customers.
    This project will form partnerships that includes the academia, industry, and
    start-up ventures to launch NaMaREC. \n\nThis I-Corps project seeks to develop
    an online marketplace named NaMaREC (National Market for Renewable Energy Certificates)
    for the selling and buying of RECs. A REC is a non-tangible, tradable energy commodity
    in the U.S. that represents proof that 1 megawatt-hour (MWh) of electricity was
    generated from a renewable energy resource. Currently, there are isolated sellers
    or aggregators of RECs across the U.S. with trades that are neither harmonized
    nor integrated. The business thesis of NaMaREC is to harness the economics of
    scale in the aggregation of RECs in a national market. The underlying motivating
    value for RECs is that 29 states and three territories of the U.S. have a policy
    mandate that requires utilities to generate a certain percentage of their outputs
    from a renewable resource such as solar photovoltaic or wind technology by a target
    date. This mandate, Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS), may be satisfied by these
    companies either by building the requisite renewable energy capacity or buying
    RECs to satisfy the RPS requirements. Isolated transactions of RECs have limited
    their market viability and accessibility by firms to meet their state-level RPS.
    NaMaREC will transform the trading of RECs in an integrated service that does
    not currently exist.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been

- abstractText: |-
    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project stems from introducing agricultural-based phase change materials (PCMs) tailored through a bottom-up approach for transforming the strength, durability, and energy efficiency of concrete structures. Considering the volume of concrete used for civil infrastructure applications every year, development of a multifunctional, low-cost, energy-efficient concrete will have a significant impact on transforming the sustainability of the built environment in the United States and potentially worldwide. Since the proposed PCMs will be produced with organic, bio-based polymers, new business and market opportunities are anticipated to be created, especially in the states with a strong agricultural basis. This will not only offer a viable alternative to the current petroleum-based, paraffinic PCMs, but will also have a meaningful contribution to improving the social and economic well-being of communities in both urban and rural areas.

    This I-Corps project will investigate the market potential of concrete materials transformed with (1) agricultural-based PCMs tailored to deliver a high capacity for energy storage and (2) porous lightweight aggregates selected to act as a container for PCMs. One of the distinct features of the proposed PCMs is an adjustable melting temperature, which helps target a range of comfort temperatures and climate zones. Further to performance considerations, the encapsulation method to incorporate PCMs into building envelope components will be one of the main focuses of this project. A number of macro- and micro-encapsulation methods have been developed to date for the use of PCMs in the building sector. Although the micro-encapsulation methods are proven to deliver an acceptable long-term performance, the estimated cost of them is in the range of 45%-65% of the total cost of the system. Exploiting the porous structure of lightweight aggregates commonly used in concrete is expected to eliminate the need to resort to costly encapsulation methods, while contributing to the rapidity and flexibility of construction, depending on customer-specific needs and preferences.

    This I-Corps project is based on deep learning algorithms developed using data from patients with sleep disorders and other neurological conditions. We created a unique deep neural network, composed of both a convolutional and recurrent  modules, and trained the model on a unique set of 10,000 clinical polysomnography (PSG) results, the world's largest collection of clinical PSGs assembled to date.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project revolves around its simplicity and accuracy. The benefit for patients is to enable them and their family members to perform accurate home testing with comfort. Meanwhile, physicians would receive real time diagnostic information about their patients, leading to earlier treatment. For insurance providers and hospitals, costs are drastically reduced as outcomes improve and fewer resources and staff are required. Apart from the healthcare industry, our project would also translate well into the general population, where wearables and health tracking devices are becoming commonplace. Being able to review the framework of one's sleep, with an accurate depiction of multiple characteristics including sleep staging, appeals to the consumer.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is
    to optimize outcomes for patients with certain kinds of heart disease and thus
    reduce healthcare costs. We have developed a virtual reality surgical planning
    tool which allows us to better understand which patients are at high risk, and
    better plan surgeries for them. If this tool becomes widely used, the benefits
    could include improving overall outcomes for people with structural heart disease,
    leading to fewer reinterventions, shorter hospital stays, lower healthcare costs,
    and improved quality of life. In addition, these tools may also be useful to neurosurgeons
    and orthopedic surgeons. Finally, if medical education is improved through virtual
    reality, this would lead to better physicians with more knowledge of anatomy.
    Regarding commercial impact, the project has multiple potential commercialization
    pathways. First, end users such as pediatric cardiologists and cardiothoracic
    surgeons can use the virtual reality surgical planning tool for their own patients.
    Further, medical device companies that make valves could use the software to teach
    physicians optimal ways to use their products, and to differentiate from their
    competitors. Finally, imaging companies could package this as the next stage of
    radiology interpretation software. \n\nThis I-Corps project focuses on planning
    structural heart disease interventions and surgeries using true 3D visualization
    with modern virtual reality techniques. These interventions require a detailed
    understanding of how different parts of the anatomy relate to each other in space.
    The development of true 3D visualization has enabled new ways of understanding
    these relationships. Already, it has been shown that the use of 3D printing in
    planning complex cases of congenital heart disease can improve surgical decision-making.
    This resulted in fewer cases where the surgeon had to change her mind about which
    surgery to perform after opening the chest. One would therefore expect better
    outcomes and greater patient satisfaction if the expected procedure is done. In
    addition, early reports suggest that virtual reality may be useful in improving
    surgical education. The virtual reality system in this project has already been
    used to plan innovative heart interventions that were previously not considered
    feasible. What is yet unknown is the extent of the effect on longer-term patient
    outcomes, both within congenital heart disease and in adult structural heart disease.
    Further development of virtual reality surgical planning tools will allow the
    field to advance as we investigate the contribution virtual reality can make.\n\nThis

    to enable clean energy solutions for combustion systems and renewable fuels by
    providing a powerful and high throughput experimental instrument for combustion
    and fuel characterization, especially for the transportation sector. In the U.S
    alone, the transportation sector, which is dominated by internal combustion engines,
    accounts for about 28% of total energy consumption, 70% of the total petroleum
    consumption and 27% of the total greenhouse emissions. The key to higher energy
    efficiency and lower emissions for this sector lies in a better understanding
    of physical and chemical characteristics of combustion processes leading to the
    development of advanced engines as well as alternative fuels, especially from
    renewable sources. The controlled trajectory rapid compression and expansion machine
    (CT-RCEM) addresses this pressing need of the combustion community by offering
    significant improvements over the conventional rapid compression machines (RCM).
    The CT-RCEM has the potential to transform the RCM market and bring unique benefits
    to end users that include universities, government research laboratories, automotive
    industry and oil and gas industry. \n\nThis I-Corps project uses a precise motion
    controller with a high speed large force electrohydraulic actuator to mitigate
    the most fundamental limitation of the conventional RCM, an inherently rigid actuation
    system. The typical operation of an RCM involves, as the name suggests, rapid
    compression of air-fuel mixture by high speed motion of a piston in combustion
    chamber, leading to the ignition of the fuel. The associated data provides valuable
    insight into the combustion characteristics. However, the piston trajectory during
    this compression process is highly facility dependent and any changes in the operating
    parameters require hardware intervention and subsequent recalibration, leading
    to repeatability and reproducibility issues as well as a long turnaround time
    between experiments. The controlled trajectory rapid compression and expansion
    machine alleviates this limitation with its precisely controllable actuation system.
    The piston motion profile can be changed by digitally changing the piston reference
    trajectory assigned to the motion controller. This ability to tailor the piston
    trajectory allows the CT-RCEM to provide significant advantages and new capabilities
    over the conventional RCM.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and

    to  monitor  sleep quality of individuals and report sleep quality index and sleep
    architecture using an ambient connected sensor. This project will potentially
    improve quality of care in some patient populations such as Alzheimer/Dementia
    patients and infants by enabling sleep quality assessment using a non-intrusive
    technology.   The passive sensor we have developed can precisely detect entire
    sleep stages as well as any abnormalities related to breathing or movement during
    sleep. The sensor is placed outside of bed and does not pose discomfort to the
    patient. It is our goal to offer a sleep sensor that will be an essential part
    of our healthy lifestyle choices.  The sensor must be non-intrusive and ambient
    to be widely accepted. Wearable or body-contact sensors take away from the natural
    sensation of sleep and might create a feeling of being monitored. For this reason,
    we believe an ideal sleep monitor should be ambient and easily blend in with the
    accessories on the bedside table. This monitor will enable the same kind of diagnostic
    power available in a hospital, to the comfort of our bedrooms. \n\nThis I-Corps
    project proposes a sleep monitor based on a passive infrared sensing technology
    which utilizes a pyroelectric material for temperature sensing.  The material
    is lithium tantalate, a crystal that has pyroelectric properties. A change in
    ambient temperature creates a change in polarization of the crystal. This change
    creates a potential across the crystal and a charge is generated similar to a
    capacitor.  The generated charge is collected by electrodes thus we obtain the
    voltage response of the pyroelectric detector.  Under constant and ambient temperature,
    the response quickly approaches steady state. Due to the thermal time constant,
    the crystal will quickly thermalize to its environment after input. Thus, we observe
    a 'voltage pulse' mechanism when there is a fast change (physical movement) against
    the background. This property makes our sensor very sensitive to fluctuations
    against the background temperature distribution and allows it to accurately detect
    fine movements such as chest motion during breathing.  We use these fine chest
    movements to detect respiration and heart rate which in turn are used to  determine
    the sleep stage.  We use respiration rate variability to determine sleep stages
    and derive sleep quality index using sophisticated signal processing methods.\n\nThis

    The broader impact and commercial potential of this I-Corps project are as follows: Cryo-Electron Microscopy (Cryo-EM) is a method for obtaining 3D structures of biological molecules. The method has growing importance in basic life science research and in the pharmaceutical sector for defining how drugs interact with their targets. Cryo-EM as a whole has matured into a powerful tool in recent years, culminating in the 2017 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, but the process of protein 'sample preparation' for 3D study has not advanced appreciably and is widely considered to represent the major bottleneck in the overall method. This bottleneck also presents a major commercial opportunity. The present project advances new nanofluidic-based technology aimed at addressing this bottleneck. Successful development of this technology will yield a consumable product ready for commercialization. Fulfillment of this goal will greatly advance and open new possibilities in cryo-EM structure determination. The resulting acceleration and enhancement of basic science and drug discovery would translate to broad societal benefit.

    This I-Corps project advances a new technology, supported by prototype data, to breach the major bottleneck in the rapidly growing cryo-EM field, with broad impact in life science and drug discovery. Cryo-EM is performed by taking images of frozen proteins using an electron microscope, then processing the images with a computer to obtain a 3D protein structure. To image and obtain a structure, the protein sample must first be frozen into a thin layer (~50-200 nm). With existing technology, this process is poorly controlled, lacks reproducibility and substantially adds to the time required to get a structure. Our device is designed to directly mitigate these sample preparation problems. It is a self-contained, freezable fluid cell nanofabricated to specification, giving full control over sample geometry and protein environment. Protein is passively loaded into the fluid cell, the loaded device is frozen, and can then be imaged directly. Materials on the top and bottom of the fluid cell are selected to transmit the electron beam through the protein sample with minimal noise. Successful prototype testing and data collection has shown the viability of the core design, with future work focused on refining the design and materials and streamlining manufacturing for eventual commercialization.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is pivoted around the emerging whole slide imaging market segment in digital pathology. The digital pathology market is predicted to reach over $800 million by 2025. The motivation of this project stems from the gigabyte size of whole slide images (WSIs), which are digital images of glass slides produced at near optical resolution. With rapid increase in the number of WSIs produced by hospitals and pathology labs, the storage and management of WSIs has become an urgent problem to tackle for next-generation image analytics. The commercial viability of the project can significantly impact researchers, medical professionals, software developers, and IT staff who wish to manage large number of WSIs using modern cluster computing and big data techniques. Thus, next-generation image analytics (e.g., using deep learning) for automatic detection and analysis of cellular and morphological features in human tissues can be performed faster on large numbers of WSIs. The potential societal benefit of the project includes enabling improved diagnosis of diseases by pathologists using next-generation image analytics and the creation of a tech startup leading to new jobs. This project will provide training to two Ph.D. students from underrepresented groups in STEM.

    This I-Corps project is based on a software technology that aims to solve the fundamental problem of scalable storage of WSIs and fast retrieval of tiles using a commodity cluster and big data techniques. The value proposition of the technology is efficient and cost-effective storage of large-scale WSIs and fast retrieval of tiles to enable next-generation image analytics for human disease diagnosis. The technology encompasses intelligent data partitioning using space-filling curves, in-memory data structures, and effective organization of tiles to enable fast retrieval of tiles during image analysis. It employs space-efficient storage formats to maximize storage efficiency. On an average, it required a few seconds to retrieve a single tile on 80 WSIs using a 16-node cluster. Therefore, we believe next-generation image analytics on WSIs (e.g., using deep learning) can run faster on large number of WSIs, which can consume terabytes of storage, through faster access of image tiles. As the technology relies on commodity hardware and open source software, it is cost-effective and can be easily deployed as a product or a service. The technology has the potential to advance the state-of-the-art in WSI storage and management using a big data approach.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project derives from its promise to positively affect not only consumers, but also enhance efficiencies in the electric energy marketplace as a whole. The basic functionality of matching users to optimal electric plans will result in both higher consumer satisfaction, and result in Retail Electric Providers (REPs) offering more competitive rate packages.  Identifying the actual usage profile of appliances over time and providing actionable information to consumers will enable consumers to take informed decisions on appliance purchases, as well as manufacturers to optimize designs with real-world inputs.   The platform will enable the solution of system-wide problems faced by utility companies like peak period demand surges to be countered through demand response initiatives such as incentivizing customers to modify their usage patterns to smoothen the load curve.  Each function of the proposed system is geared toward addressing a specific source of friction in the electric energy marketplace, and consequently also possesses commercial potential.  Thus, the overall economic impact will be on consumers, REPs, utility companies and appliance manufactures, while promoting a greater knowledge and engagement among the electricity consumers.

    This I-Corps project explores the value of creating a bundled energy management system aimed at residential users.  The system uses machine-learning-based analytics of the customer's daily, weekly, monthly, and seasonal energy usage trends to offer potential savings through (1) recommending the best retail energy service provider plan matching the customer's usage patterns, (2) incentivizing customers to enable full integration with smart home devices, including smart thermostats, (3) identifying and predicting the electricity consumption of different appliances and providing actionable information on their optimal usage and maintenance, and (4) services to allow customers to navigate through the process of switching plans. A smartphone app available for the iOS and Android platforms forms the customer interface to the system.  The key novelties of this project lie in the development and integration of machine learning tools and behavioral economics ideas into the domain of residential energy management.  The project is founded on research into the design, development and validation of such tools in contexts such as predicting residential energy usage over time, disaggregating usage on a per-appliance basis, and experimentation on how best to motivate users to engage in energy usage behavior that induces efficient grid operation.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to provide a means to deliver highly original natural sounds recordings to over 3000 science, technology and nature centers in the United States that are moving to sonify their exhibit spaces. Exhibit spaces are now rapidly becoming electronic and interactive and they require audiovisual materials. The advances in audio focusing speaker technologies are making it possible to concentrate sound into a small space for single or small group experiences and touchscreens are now emerging in public spaces. Our customer discovery activities will determine how a nature ounds exhibit can serve the needs of this very large informal STEM learning community as they become digital. The products will 1) provide an extension of a natural setting in an accessible space for people, 2) introduce visually impaired people to STEM concepts using tactile methods, 3) utilize science standards in curriculum for camps/classrooms with authentic scientific equipment, 4) build knowledge about concepts such as biodiversity and preservation of habitats, and 4) impact how people are introduced to STEM concepts. These products have the potential to recruit individuals from an underrepresented community to STEM.

    This I-Corps project will lead to significant understanding of market size and commercial potential for nature exhibit products. This audio collection represents the culmination of global fieldwork at over 50 terrestrial and marine study sites representing nine of the twelve major biomes. Over 5,000,000 natural sound recordings from nearly every major terrestrial and marine biome are now available along with rich information on scientific research projects being conducted to study important environmental issues such as biodiversity, wildfire, invasive species, over grazing, toxic substances and climate variability. These audio files and scientific projects have been organized into learning modules that are interactive, informative and inspiring forming a flexible set of tools for building digital exhibits. Interactive kiosks have been developed and tested in several informal learning venues with considerable success.  Finally, the outcome from the informal learning curriculum and complete studies from Borneo, Mongolia, Patagonia, and Tanzania, have been published in a wide range of peer-review journals which provides the validity to the scientific interpretation of the role that sounds play in nature.

    the improvement to public health from improved containment of aerial insect-borne
    diseases and decreased use of toxic pesticides. Traditional, chemical pest-control
    methods are imprecise, causing damage after they have been applied. This technology
    creates the option for controlled extermination, which in turn can prevent an
    imbalanced predator-prey relationship and ultimately the unintended collapse of
    symbiotic populations, such as bat/birds. Moreover, it does not pose threats to
    human safety from chemical contamination of air or water supply, or even residue
    ingested via harvested crops. This project could also combat serious public health
    risks, such as Zika, by eliminating carriers in populated areas. This benefit
    would also hold appeal for those in sports and leisure applications by reducing
    pests at stadiums or while enjoying activities such as hiking or fishing. Based
    on disruptive technology, this team hopes to provide these benefits at a lower
    cost than present pest-control or healthcare solutions, based on the precision
    level and expanded area of effect. This generates economic gains and the possibility
    of exporting products to be competitive in markets with reduced means while supporting
    American intellectual property. \n\nThis I-Corps project is formed around a disruptive
    technology in the pest control and ecosystem management space. More concisely,
    it is a green and cheaper alternative to traditional chemical pest control that
    can capture invasive and harmful species of flying insects without harming or
    otherwise affecting non-targeted species. This technology has commercial applications
    in agricultural, leisure, residential, and health management (disease control)
    sectors. This work would determine the need for highly effective and thorough
    collection and containment of disease carrying flying insects by agencies responding
    to threats such as Zika virus. The team would also like to explore the large footprint
    agricultural sector to see if this could be a viable-and preferable- alternative
    to traditional pesticides. Products derived from this project will be capable
    of the target and capture of specific flying insects and utilize advanced manufacturing
    methods in optics and electronics, as well as enabling enhanced sampling for those
    studying insect species. In summary, this green, portable, specialized technology
    has superior environmental benefits and can potential provide superior pest control
    at a reduced cost from traditional, and more harmful, alternatives.\n\nThis award

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the use of autonomous robotic systems to save lives across multiple disaster levels by multiplying human efforts in areas such as disaster response, extending to reduced response times and improved rescue efforts during disaster relief. Using autonomous systems, such as drones, that run software which allows for the use of biosensors and on-board machine learning, natural disaster responders can find survivors faster and reduce casualties. The technology understands mission objectives (intent-driven), coordinates with others (collaborative autonomy) and is voice enabled (natural language conversational interface), allowing it to work well with both humans and machines. These and other features lend this technology to broad commercial applications, offering the best strategy to mitigate multiple disaster levels - at the district or provincial level by assessing strengths and vulnerabilities to various hazards; at the community level like search and rescue during a flood or fire; and at the household level like ambulatory drone service care for the aging.

    This I-Corps project will be focused on translating scientific research to commercialization through lessons on the business model canvas and extensive customer discovery. Our research has involved hands-on technical experimentation using deep/machine learning software for prototype development and literature reviews on a variety of software capabilities. Using a camera with machine learning, we were able to identify a human with most of the body obscured. Hardware acts as transport for the optical and acoustical biosensor package which can take action autonomously by utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) technologies extending to: realtime onboard object detection capable of identifying a person in rubble, even when the person is partially obscured (Machine/Deep Learning/edge), offline cloud-enriched datasets for cloud-sourced analysis, voice recognition/conversational natural language processing/speech synthesis. Blockchain enabled autonomous swarm management technology on multiple robotic devices will enable multiple machine collaboration. All sensor data is time-stamped and stored in the cloud where the AI technologies are used to enrich the data. Enriched data is made available offline via the internet to thousands of volunteers for human review. Results from our research show that the technological capability exists, the software and hardware components combined meet a need established through our initial customer discovery.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to provide pharmaceutical companies and life scientists with a cost effective and fast approach for determining the high-resolution protein structure by X-ray crystallography. Production of high-resolution structures of proteins is one the main steps in structure-based drug design. Although cost reduction and efficiency improvements are the important benefits of structure-based drug design, the lack of generalized methods for high quality, fast and low-cost crystal production is still a major struggle in this process. Microfluidics, is a powerful liquid handling tool that reduces the amount of solution in a screening experiment to nanoliters, have been introduced to the protein crystallization market earlier. However, none of these approaches have penetrated the market because of the high cost to performance ratio. Our innovation is an x-ray transparent microfluidic chip for protein crystallization which is less expensive, easier to operate and more performant in comparison to the current market solutions. By commercializing this device and introducing it to the market, pharmaceutical companies and life scientists will reduce the time and money spent to determine the high-resolution structure of proteins from x-ray diffraction, which is a current bottleneck in structure-based drug discovery.

    This I-Corps project introduces an inexpensive, x-ray transparent microfluidic chip for protein crystallization.  For many medical and biological applications, such as pharmaceutical engineering, the molecular structure of a protein is essential. The most accurate way to determine protein structure is X-ray crystallography, a process that requires the analysis of X-ray diffraction patterns of protein crystals.  However, protein crystallization remains challenging because each protein has its own phase diagram, thus, many different conditions should be tried to find the optimal conditions for protein crystallization. Our technology addresses four core challenges in protein crystallization; it (1) screens chemical conditions for protein crystal stability, (2) produces crystals using optimized processing kinetics, (3) obtains structure with room temperature crystals, and (4) avoids crystal handling by diffracting on chip. On-chip X-ray diffraction has been demonstrated for our protein crystallization chips. Prototypes of our first design have been made and have been tested for protein crystallization with one specific solution. Our design is a liquid handling chip with multiple advantages over current microfluidic chips. It is built from inexpensive bio-compatible material via a rapid fabrication procedure and it can be altered as needed based on the customer need.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is on revolutionizing the real-time Structural Health Monitoring (the entire concrete or other composites where smart cement is use as the binder becomes a 3D sensor and there are no buried sensors) and also pre-warning of infrastructure, building and pipeline failures, fire hazard and seismic activity. This will reduce the loss of life, accidents and disruption of economic activity by enhancing quality control and monitoring throughout the lifetime of the structures. The real-time monitoring will also help maintain the critical structures in a cost effective manner. Smart cement technology can also be used in quality control of mixing concrete with various types of additives and also the curing of the concrete under various environments and also predicting the long-term properties and strength of concrete and other materials where smart cement is used as the binder. The smart cement technology can be used with any type of cement and has a very wide application in civil infrastructures and also oil and gas industry for cementing wells. Also smart cement blocks can be used in old structures and residential buildings for monitoring which will also become a very popular commercial market for smart cement applications.

    This I-Corps project will commercialize the Smart Cement which has been recently developed and proven to be a highly sensing and sensitive material to changes in stresses, temperature, cracks contamination, aging and degradation. The smart cement is technically known as chemo-thermo-piezoresistive cement and behavior models have been developed to predict the behavior of the smart cement. The monitoring parameter is the change in electrical resistivity of the material in any direction. This technology can be easily adopted in any type of cement, which is the largest manufactured material in the world annually. Since less than 0.1% of additive (no nano particles) is used in the cement, it is a very cost effective modification and making the cement to be very sensing without changing any other properties and also complies with all the environmental requirements.  When this smart cement is used to make the concrete (cement + aggregate) or binders in other composites (example cement mortar and cement bricks) it will make the material to be very sensing in 3 dimension (3D) and pick changes in any direction. The sensing characteristics can be used from the time of mixing to the entire service life of the structures.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the ability to have a standardized quality of craniofacial surgery by providing accuracy and flexibility, improved patient outcome & satisfaction, reduced number of surgeries and intraoperative time resulting in reduced cost of care and patient morbidity. Regeneration of the natural bone is an additive advantage over currently used fixative implants. These implants are also a source of secondary infections and fracture, such risks are mitigated with the formation of natural tissues, eliminating the need for surgical recall. The U.S. reports ~7.5 million Emergency Department visits related to craniomaxillofacial (CMF) injuries, at a cost of $55.2 billion annually. The technology proposes a fundamental shift in CMF bone reconstruction, allowing regeneration of craniofacial bone using guided 3D printed osteoconductive scaffolds. This translates to reflecting a soft tissue flap over a defect to allow a laser or image guided analyzer to study the defect volume and contours, after which a robotic extruder deposits the scaffold into the desired area.

    This I-Corps project addresses reconstruction of craniomaxillofacial (CMF) bone defects caused by trauma, developmental anomalies or benign/malignant tumors. Our technology is transforming CMF reconstruction by 3D printing osteoconductive/inductive scaffolds directly into defects.  Preliminary studies on critical-sized calvarial defects in a rat model demonstrated the regeneration of bone while preserving dural tissue. A methacrylated Gelatin-Laponite nanosilicate bio-ink was utilized to print a mesh-like scaffold for a critical-sized defect in rat calvaria. The in-situ printing in the defects helped maintain the micro-pattern stability of the scaffold and the nano-silicate particle-enhanced bone regeneration. These results indicated the possibility of overcoming the current shortcomings in osseous tissue regeneration.

  title: 'I-Corps:  Live printing osteoconductive scaffolds'
- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project stems
    from developing novel carbon film coatings that provide necessary hardness and
    other chemical characteristics. Such superior coatings are expected to have a
    potential market of billions of dollars. In automotive applications, coating the
    engine surfaces and the piston rings with the high-performance carbon films will
    improve the fuel efficiency and substantially reduce Carbon Dioxide and Nitrogen
    Oxide emissions to benefit the environment. Broad applications of the low-friction
    and super-hard carbon coatings on cutting tools, bearings, glass, and electrodes
    will greatly reduce the manufacturing costs and the consumption of the earth's
    resources.  \n\nThis I-Corps project aims to determine the commercial viability
    of a patent-pending magnetically enhanced cathodic arc plasma technology that
    is capable of coating the inner and outer surfaces of working components, such
    as engine liners and bearings. This technology overcomes the limitation of line-of-sight
    in conventional physical vapor depositions. A properly designed magnetic field
    efficiently confines the arc plasma. A single arc current can reach over 100 Amps
    to locally vaporize the target materials. The evaporated particles have high kinetic
    energies, leading to excellent adhesion of the coatings to the substrate surfaces.
    When a graphite target is used, the energetic carbon species form strong bonds
    with a combination of multiple extreme properties: 1) a hardness value of over
    6000 Vickers (close to diamond) compared with ~200 Vickers of 304 stainless steel;
    2) a low friction coefficient of ~0.1, similar to the value of Teflon; and 3)
    a superior chemical inertness and resistance to corrosion.\n\nThis award reflects
    NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
    using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

- abstractText: "The broad impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is
    the introduction of a novel class of nanoparticle-molecular hybrid materials with
    a wide range of applications in the life sciences. These hybrid probes will enable
    the non-invasive delivery of ultra-violet and visible photons deep in tissue where
    the light could not otherwise penetrate, to mark targets for therapy or diagnostics.
    For example, this light may be used to trigger the uncaging of tumor drugs at
    local points of interest, excite fluorophores for imaging, initiate neural firing
    or cellular signal transduction cascades in genetically engineered species, etc.
    \ The application of our materials will enable more advanced experiments, leading
    to better understanding of complex systems such as the brain, which will ultimately
    help treat and prevent brain disorders. In addition, since these particles perform
    photon upconversion at very low excitation densities, much cheaper non-coherent
    light sources such as red LEDs can replace the high power near-infrared lasers
    currently required today. This is ideal for point of care testing for personalized
    medicine and the battlefield where instant diagnosis and portability are essential.\n
    \nThe I-Corps project is based on a molecular-nanocrystal hybrid that upconverts
    light via a multi-step energy transfer process. For the life science applications
    mentioned above, our label exhibits much higher sensitivity than existing commercial
    technologies by avoiding excitation at the optical window where biological species
    absorb, scatter, and autofluoresce. Different components of the system can be
    tuned to selectively produce high energy ultra-violet and visible photons from
    incoming low energy near-infrared photons. Synthetic control of both the nanocrystal
    light absorber and molecular transmitter and emitter have resulted in a high photon
    upconversion quantum yield. Fundamental understanding and further development
    of this technology involves interdisciplinary research in the fields of photophysics,
    material science, and synthetic chemistry.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory
    mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's

    that it will lay the foundation for developing a novel ?rechargeable? antimicrobial
    coating product that is easily applied to, and absorbed by, a wide variety of
    surfaces, to prevent the transmission of contaminants. In the food industry, this
    antimicrobial coating product could help to reduce the public health risk and
    burden due to foodborne illness outbreaks and reduce economic losses for food
    industry due to spoilage or pathogenic microorganism contamination. For the health
    care industry, the coating could provide a low-cost and highly-effective option
    for preventing the cross-contamination of drug-resistant microorganism or ?superbugs?
    on communal environmental surfaces in hospitals and health care facilities. If

    of current antimicrobial coatings. There are two critical innovations of our antimicrobial
    coating material: 1) broad, potent, and rechargeable biocidal function; 2) strong
    and versatile absorbance on surfaces regardless of materials, sizes, and shapes.
    We have done a significant amount of work to synthesize, formulate, and prototype
    the coatings on substrate materials (stainless steels and plastics) that are commonly

    be the improvement of the quality of lives of both the individuals with Autism
    Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and their caregivers. The prevalence of autism has increased
    by 15% in 2014. Now, 1 in 59 children born in the US has ASD. This translates
    to roughly 5.5 million individuals in the US who are less likely to go to college
    or find a job after high school. Our user-friendly, discreet device can help affected
    individuals gain independence and create a supportive learning or working environment
    for them. Pre-emptive meltdown detection and care devices are virtually non-existent
    in the current marketplace. As the first to enter the market at an affordable
    price point, we expect to lead and spawn derivative products. Beyond autism, our
    platform technology can be utilized to push data to a healthcare professional,
    catalyzing informed and personalized preventive care. Other conceivable application
    is monitoring compliance and measuring the effectiveness of rehabilitation exercises
    for muscle engagement of stroke patients. Our innovation also has the potential
    to reach and assist those affected by other types of anxiety disorders. It can
    help people become more informed about their own mental health, intervene, and
    lead healthier lives. \n\nThis I-Corps project involves wearable technology for
    predicting, detecting, tracking, and mitigating meltdowns for individuals with

    two components: The hardware portion consists of a detachable, water-resistant
    core unit for biosignal filtering, processing, and transmission as well as machine
    washable sensors that can be embedded into apparel; The software portion consists
    of our proprietary machine learning models for determination of when a meltdown
    is to occur, alerting the parent or caregiver of a high risk of a meltdown, and
    an assessment of mitigation techniques afterwards. Our innovation will advance
    autism research, as the technology has the potential to open the doors to a better
    understanding of behavioral phenotypes. Being able to tell what a non-verbal child
    is feeling can pave the way for more efficient and productive lessons for social/education
    development as well as broader phenotypical research. The assessment feature of
    our product will lead to the improvement of mitigation techniques for meltdowns.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project involves the optimization of human resource deployment via technology. More specifically, this endeavor leverages systems research to inform software with machine learning to inform how to organize work across industries and align that work with available human resources in a manner that optimizes outcomes. This technology can serve to benefit diverse industries; however, it offers unique value for healthcare settings which often have scare human resources deployed in rapidly changing environments. In clinical environments, how care is organized can have significant implications for cost, quality, and outcomes. This software will collect and analyze large volumes of data related to individuals and the environment to organize and assign work optimally (i.e. to improve clinical outcomes, decrease costs and increase efficiency). This technology has significant commercial potential beyond healthcare environments to any industry that routinely organizes and assigns work to a workforce where considerations of individual characteristics and environmental characteristics have significance.

    This I-Corps project involves pursuits focused on better understanding the application potential of research-driven technology in various industries with a specific focus on inpatient clinical environments (i.e. hospitals). The technology automates and optimizes nurse staffing in hospital settings. It uses a data-driven algorithm informed by qualitative and quantitative research to make nurse-patient assignments that improve outcomes, save time, and reduce stress. The research driving this technology is inclusive of a review and synthesis of relevant nursing, health systems, and work science literature as well as qualitative research involving interviews of nurses and quantitative research assessing relationships between inpatient clinical work environments and patient outcomes. The technology integrates research data from nurses, patients, and hospital structural factors to inform algorithms driving nurse-patient matches. Machine learning elements of the software facilitate this optimization process. The software also serves as a mechanism for collecting a unique data set that records patient-nurse ?exposures? on the individual level and on an unprecedented scale. Such a data set is of great value to health services researchers, hospital quality improvement teams, and to our team as it seeks to improve and customize the algorithm with potential to decrease costs of care and improve patient and nurse outcomes.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to enable a broader range of end users to utilize the capabilities of autonomous robotics and to make advanced autonomous systems more broadly accessible and reliable. Robotics such as micro aerial vehicles (MAVs), self-driving cars, and other ground-based service robots are playing increasingly important roles in the lives of many industries as advances in autonomy enable them to be used safely and reliably in diverse situations. Accurately tracking targets and navigating while avoiding obstacles are important prerequisites to fully autonomous operation for robots. Neuromorphic cameras can more accurately detect motion than traditional cameras while consuming far less power. This project will explore the commercial applications of algorithms which interpret the data from neuromorphic cameras to enable autonomous systems to accurately track motion and navigate in unknown environments. By enabling more accurate sensing with reduced power consumption, these algorithms will increase the safety and reliability of autonomous systems. The proposed techniques will enable autonomous systems to react safely and robustly in real time to unexpected environmental changes without immediate operator intervention.

    This I-Corps project will explore the commercialization of neuromorphic sensing and control algorithms that enable accurate environmental sensing from moving robotic platforms. Autonomous navigation requires processing data from exteroceptive sensors for the purposes of obstacle avoidance and target tracking. These tasks must be accomplished in real time with minimal latency to maximize the capabilities and reliability of the autonomous robot. Neuromorphic cameras sense the environment with sub-millisecond latency and, unlike traditional cameras, provide information only about changes in the scene. The algorithms which will be explored by this project efficiently process the data from neuromorphic sensors to detect the presence of moving targets and stationary obstacles to enable efficient autonomous control for high-speed aerial and ground-based robots in uncertain and rapidly changing environments. These algorithms include neuromorphic control techniques which enable autonomous control in the presence of both environmental uncertainties such as disturbances and uncertain variations in the physical parameters of the robot. The proposed techniques have been validated in high-fidelity simulations using benchmark datasets and have been shown to be capable of rapid adaptation to unexpected changes while maintaining control of the autonomous system.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project relates to a control system for mitigating earthquake-induced damage and wind-induced vibrations in buildings. The estimated long-term value of the loss of building stock in the USA in a year, due to earthquakes (Annualized Earthquake Loss), is $5.3 billion. This project's technology has the potential to prevent loss of human life and property from earthquakes. Although windstorms do not typically cause damage to tall buildings, they can produce considerable vibrations. Prolonged exposure to such vibrations has been known to lead to nausea and even migraines among inhabitants of tall buildings. This project's technology may eliminate the side effects of wind vibrations for a large segment of people.

    This I-Corps project is focused on an adaptive control system for controlling vibrations of structures. The control system is friction based, leading to low cost fabrication and maintenance. The system can be installed in a newly built building, as well as can be retrofitted in an existing building. The state-of-art adaptive seismic energy dissipaters limit structural deformations by increasing their stiffness with displacement. This project's technology can outperform current systems as it limits the structural deformation by increasing both stiffness and energy dissipation with displacement. Seismic waves have higher energy content at higher frequencies (around 1 Hz), while windstorms have higher energy content at lower frequencies (0.001-0.1 Hz). The energy dissipation capability of the proposed technology is frequency independent. Hence it can absorb both forced and free vibrations of tall buildings at all frequencies of wind loading.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is that the project's technology, based on computing, engineering and materials technologies, may provide a sense of safety and comfort to anosmics (those who suffer from a loss of a sense of smell).  People with a loss of their sense of smell are typically  concerned about being near potential hazards that are difficult to detect without a sense of smell, such as fires, gas leaks, food that is spoiling, and hazardous chemicals. As there are no methods or products that can closely mimic the human nose, the detection performance and user-friendliness of a substitute device will target a relatively untapped market -- approximately 5% of the general population or over 15 million people in the United States alone. It is anticipated that this project's device will be a more affordable, reliable and less invasive alternative to surgery or other treatments. Furthermore, the technology can be used in a wide range of applications, such as drug or explosives detection, food quality monitoring (such as identifying diseases and/or ripeness of fruits and other produce), air quality monitoring and control, harmful solvent detection for defense application, and smart bandage for wound monitoring.

    This I-Corps project involves the manufacture of a device with a high-density, high-performance gas sensor array based on nanotechnology, chemistry, computer science and engineering. The facile, fast fabrication methods of nanomaterials as sensing materials introduces the possibility of mass manufacturing. Real-time response to a range of gas analytes along with fast recovery of the sensing medium provides a solid technical foundation for this project. Currently at a pre-alpha prototyping stage, the device, with its full integration with a custom-designed circuit board and precisely fabricated sensing nanomaterials, not only eliminates the need for tedious and costly microfabrication, which is typical for gas sensors, but may also be able to imitate the detection level of a human nose, even exceeding the detection performance for some gas analytes.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is based on a device which passively adjusts the mechanical advantage of a motor-driven actuator. This device, known as the Elastomeric Passive Transmission (EPT), improves the force and speed of tendon-driven actuation systems with minimal impact to their size, weight, and cost. Approximately 40,000 people per year suffer from major upper limb loss in the United States. The grip strength, grasping speed, and active degrees-of-freedom of even the most advanced prosthetic hands used by these patients pale in comparison to those of a human hand. User studies have shown that 90% of patients with myoelectric prostheses consider their prosthetic hand to be too slow and 79% consider it to be too heavy. By incorporating the EPT into their designs, prosthetic limb manufacturers can increase the force and speed of their devices with reduced cost and weight. In addition to improving the performance of prosthetics, the EPT has the potential to bring performance benefits to grippers and manipulators in the field of robotic automation.

    This I-Corps project is leverages advances in additive manufacturing to produce simple, low-cost components to improve the performance of electromechanical systems. Each EPT is a composite consisting of both hard and soft polyurethane sections. The hard polyurethane serves as the core of the EPT ensuring that it does not slip on the motor shaft. This core is surrounded by a ring of soft, stretchable struts which give the system its dynamic spooling radius. The EPTs are 3D-printed in two parts and bonded together during the final curing stage. This leads to a single component transmission system which can passively sense the environment and adjust the output of a motor to improve performance and control. The benefits of EPTs have been demonstrated through integration into a 3D-printed prosthetic hand which demonstrates high speed and high force in an inexpensive and lightweight package.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to understand the problems that the industry and federal agencies face during the operation of underwater vehicles for applications such as, ocean monitoring, inspection of coastal structures, rescue missions and/or hydrographic survey. Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are key for multiple underwater missions including detecting and mapping submerged wrecks, ocean bed-floor, polluted water, as well as surveillance of coastal zones and coastal structures. In many circumstances AUVs are preferred over conventional towed instruments or marine surface vehicles because AUVs can get closer to the area of interest, they can cover large areas without constant monitoring or hover hazardous areas without putting at risk humans life. Although current AUVs have many capabilities, one main limitation is their inability to perform precise station-keeping which allows the vehicle to hold its position and adjust for currents. New technology in underwater propulsion will permit the development and control of a new generation of highly maneuverable vessels that have to operate in more challenging environments. The proposed work is expected to increase the partnership between academia, marine industries and national defense agencies. In addition, it will promote the progress of science and national security using bio-inspired technology.

    This I-Corps project focuses in the propulsion technology and control strategy for AUVs that needs to operate in tight space, low-speed with high mobility and perform station-keeping missions. Bio-inspired undulating fin can provide multiple advantages including: superior maneuverability to control forward motion and directional maneuver with a single undulating fin; precise maneuvers suitable for station-keeping and maneuvers in tight spaces; reduce risk to get tangled in marine plants and ropes with less impact on the marine ecosystem; relative low speed with likely lower acoustic signature.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is
    in facilitating innovations in a wide range of industries working on advanced
    computing-based applications as the result of a reliable neuromorphic chip (where
    neural networks are etched into silicon). This technology may accelerate the advance
    of machine learning and ultimately realize a breakthrough in computing architecture
    by overcoming the Von Neumann bottleneck -- where the intrinsic latency originated
    from the separation of processor and memory. Empowered by neuromorphic features
    of this project's technology, machine learning may be carried out with unprecedented
    speed and efficiency in design and energy consumption. Hence, intensive machine
    learning based technologies such as face recognition, autonomous driving and other
    areas of artificial intelligence will be advanced by a significant margin. A successful
    execution of the project will also facilitate widespread commercialization of
    emerging applications utilizing artificial intelligence and/or neuromorphic computing.
    \n\nThis I-Corps project leverages the recent innovative research related to highly
    controllable neuromorphic devices. The technology is based on the oxide-based
    resistive random access memory (ReRAM), a non-volatile memory based upon electrical
    stimuli-induced resistance changes, mostly by the formation and rupture of so-called
    nanoscale conducting filaments in each cell. The intrinsic resemblance of ReRAM
    cells to neuromorphic systems triggered a recent boom in related research. However,
    there are still considerable technical issues including wide cell-to-cell variations
    in operation voltage, cell current and operation speed. Unclear understanding
    of physical switching mechanisms precludes a rationale design of reliable cells
    for a commercial device. The proposed novel scheme, in which the uncontrollability
    is significantly minimized, is expected to achieve a breakthrough in realizing
    commercializable neuromorphic devices.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory
    mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's

    a novel technology for the detection and the surveillance of cancer. Assays known
    as ?liquid biopsies? seek to diagnose or monitor cancer by surveying small amounts
    of body fluids for cancer biomarkers can be confounded by contaminants. This project
    will examine the potential of a novel ?silicon nanomembrane? device to serve the
    liquid biopsy market by purifying cancer biomarkers quickly and with high purity.
    By enabling cancer to be discovered early, the technology could dramatically impact
    the cost of cancer care. In bladder cancer surveillance for example, a liquid
    biopsy assay could replace invasive and expensive cystoscopy exams with simple
    urinalysis. In addition to its potential to lower US health care costs, the project
    is expected to have regional impact through the addition of a new commercial enterprise
    or the growth of an existing nanomembrane manufacturer. \n\nThis I-Corps project
    will investigate the commercial potential of a novel device for the capture of
    naturally occurring vesicles, called exosomes, from raw body fluids. These vesicles
    are released by tumor cells into body fluids and thus have tremendous potential
    in cancer diagnostics. Current exosome purification techniques are labor intensive
    and co-purify exosomes with protein. We have discovered that our ultrathin nanoporous
    silicon nitride (NPN) membranes can capture and purify large quantities of exosomes
    from biofluids when used in simple microfluidic devices. We have also developed
    sophisticated nanomembranes featuring photonic structures that could be used to
    determine the molecular composition of exosomes. Through interviews with potential
    customers, we will attempt to identify a minimum viable product that could gain
    early traction in the market. We will also seek to define the features of a more
    sophisticated product concept that could be transformative to cancer diagnosis.
    We hope to emerge from the experience with a clear value proposition and an understanding
    of the infrastructure and partnerships we will need to make a new commercial enterprise.\n\nThis

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project has to do with impacts on global markets that involve catalysts.  Catalysts influence many fields in science and technology such as material science, electrochemical processes, nano science and energy storage technologies.  These areas represent some of the most rapidly evolving global sciences and applications. The novel catalyst material that is the basis of this project will likely have commercial impact in global markets in that 60% of chemical synthesis and 90% of chemical transformations in chemical industries are currently dependent on the catalysts. According to the North American Catalysis Society, approximately 35% of global GDP depends on catalysts and the use of catalysts in the industry is increasing by 5% every year. With the growing market need of catalyst materials and the facile synthesis methodology for large scale production, this project's catalyst can be a potential game changer in the global market.

    This I-Corps project is primarily intended to identify the market need and characterize the technological gap to commercialize a  recently developed nano catalyst based on metal-organic framework-modified nitrogen-doped graphene (N-G/MOF) for oxygen reduction reaction applications. The modification of the nitrogen-doped graphene (N-G) catalyst by metal-organic framework materials (MOFs) has been developed to enhance the catalytic and electrochemical performance of N-G catalysts. The MOF-modified N-G catalyst (N-G/MOF) has high catalytic performance due to high surface area and porosity, which has better performance than the conventional precious group metal (PGM) catalyst. The innovative and economically viable synthesis method using nano high energy wet (NHEW) ball milling was developed for the synthesis of nitrogen-doped graphene catalyst in room temperature environments. The NHEW ball milling synthesis method offers a long-term solution to the primary challenges generated during the high-temperature synthesis process, and serve as the primary synthesis method for the industry-scale production of the N-G/MOF catalyst in the future.

    improved health and economic impact as a result of a 3D printing technology, combined
    with fluid dynamic modeling, that has the potential to prolong breastfeeding.
    An individualized, 3D printed silicone bottle nipple, that closely mimics a mother's
    breast, creates continuity between bottle and breast, reducing the primary barrier
    to breastfeeding, nipple confusion.  Prolonged breastfeeding and skin to skin
    contact enables breast milk to continually act in establishing immunity, enabling
    protective neurological development, and genetic optimization through microbiome
    establishment.  The core technology of this project has a commercialization potential
    to solve issues mothers face every day and the global societal impact of the innovation
    could be substantial.  It is projected that increasing rates of breastfeeding
    could save the lives of more than 820,000 children under age five, annually, prevent
    20,000 breast cancer deaths, while saving $300 billion annually in health care
    costs worldwide. \n\nThis I-Corps project aims to evaluate the commercialization
    potential of a baby bottle nipple concept which replicates a mother's nipple in
    terms of shape and texture while matching the flow rate to that of the maternal
    flow rate.  One of the intellectual merits of the innovation is its individualized
    3D printed silicone bottle nipple which addresses nipple confusion related to
    shape based on a 3D survey of a mother's nipples.  The 3D scanning technology
    \ allows mothers to use an application to scan their breasts to be able to select
    which 3D printed mold fits their breasts the best, leading to seamless bottle
    to breast continuity.  The innovation also appropriately addresses nipple confusion
    related to flow rate in its design.  The team conducted fluid dynamics analyses
    to determine the flow rate through the printed nipple that matches the flow rate
    from a small data set from preterm mothers.  The core technology has the potential
    to allow better continuity between the breast and bottle, help enable mothers
    to overcome the barriers they face so they can continue breastfeeding for the
    recommended minimum of 2 years.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to eliminate antibiotic use during biomanufacturing in the chemical and biotechnology industries, and to enable robust, contamination-free continuous processes that reduce upstream costs by 20-50%. Currently the biotechnology industry is growing at an astounding 7.5% per annum with a predicted value of $760B by 2025.  However, industrial fermentation plant failure data collected over a 15-year period suggests that 1 in 10 process cultures are subject to microbial contamination and associated production failure. Furthermore, while continuous bioreactor processes significantly improve productivity and reduce unit operation costs, most biotechnology industries shy away from them because of the inherent sensitivity to contamination.  Reduced bioreactor failure rate and operational cost is essential for the economic viability of bio-commodity chemicals such as biofuels, as production costs are a big impediment to large-scale manufacture; and their market demand depends primarily on their price competitiveness with petroleum-derived counterparts. Our technology can increase the productivity and profit margin of these companies. With our technology, large-scale bio-commodity chemicals production could become economically feasible. In addition to reduced operational costs, antibiotic-free production alleviates antibiotic misuse in industries to promote a positive environmental and public heath impact.

    This I-Corps project comprises a novel biocide/biocide-resistant system that could be used to treat and prevent microbial contamination in bioreactors. This technology allows bioprocessing engineers to eliminate the microbial contamination problem by addition of a biocide into the bioprocessing hosts' growth medium. The biocide prohibits the outgrowth of accidental contaminants while a biocide-resistant enzyme protects the bioprocessing host. The system also contains an on/off switch that allows easy removal of the biocide as needed. Preliminary data demonstrates that heterologous expression of the biocide-resistant enzyme in Escherichia coli and subsequent directed evolution resulted in a biocide-resistant Escherichia coli with a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) approximately 16 times higher than the negative controls. We further demonstrate that this biocide in combination with the expression of biocide-resistant enzyme can be used to successfully treat a contaminated bioreactor.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to enable the decentralization of diagnostic blood testing. Existing point-of-care clinics are limited to a narrow range of diagnostic capabilities as they currently do not possess simple methods to perform blood-plasma separation. High Efficiency Rapid Magnetic Erythrocyte Separator (H.E.R.M.E.S) offers a highly efficient solution to meet the needs of sample processing in point-of-care environments and its commercialization will enable the translation of existing diagnostic tests from traditional labs to more accessible clinical settings. Access to rapid sample processing capabilities will also ensure retention of sample integrity and reduce the incidences of inaccurate diagnosis that may result from poor sample storage. Further, H.E.R.M.E.S is highly suitable to integrate into the healthcare infrastructure of resource-limited settings as it can provide low-cost sample processing capabilities. Successful deployment will result in an increased accessibility to testing services and will potentially allow point-of-care clinics to capture a greater percentage of the blood-testing market

    This I-Corps project explores the commercial potential of a translational method to perform blood-plasma separation. H.E.R.M.E.S uses magnetic bead-based separation to obtain plasma free of red blood cells in a short amount of time. H.E.R.M.E.S is a low-cost and standalone platform that has the potential to augment the testing efficiency and translational ability of existing blood-based diagnostic tests. H.E.R.M.E.S will address the lack of availability of low-cost and efficient sample processing technologies; a barrier that prevents existing point-of-care clinics from offering in-house blood testing services. Current experiments show that H.E.R.M.E.S offers performance similar to that of a centrifuge (near 100% plasma purity) at a fraction of the time and cost (process time of 2 minutes at less than $2 per test). The underlying research complements ongoing work in developing point-of-care medical technologies to perform diagnostic testing in the field. The technology utilizes inexpensive raw materials that are readily available, and the process flow has been designed to ensure semi-autonomous operation ? key factors that indicate favorable scale-up potential.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is based on a new material that has the capability to reduce skin morbidity in amputees. Skin morbidity is an especially critical concern for patients with decreased wound healing capability because of vascular diseases such as diabetes and endovascular disease. Most current commercially available wound liners intended to avoid decreased wound healing have additions or modifications to base materials that target skin health. These include medicated coatings, cooling systems, and vacuum attachments. However, they do not correct the root of the problem - they aim to treat the secondary problems caused by those materials: heat, sweat, pistoning, and potential of microbial growth. Thus, more preventative technologies are called for than those that will only treat already developed skin wear or infection. This project's technology will not only transform the prosthetic liner industry, but also offer a new approach for other situations that might lead to skin infection issues.

    This I-Corps project combines multiple materials with favorable properties into a single polymeric system that retains a liner's mechanical robustness while wicking away heat and sweat from limb-prosthesis interfaces.  While similar polymeric structures have been used as membranes as well as drug delivery systems, they could be incorporated to the liner materials to improve the liner functioning. This project produces a breathable sleeve with minimal skin irritation, essential for amputees. The in situ production of these liners enables prosthetist and physicians to customize the shape of liners in real time to best meet the need of individuals.

    The broader impact/commercialization potential of this I-Corps project involves the application of multi-sensor technologies to  improve the management and treatment of patients with implanted catheters. Catheter blockage and failure results in ineffective treatment, leading to life-threatening symptoms. Hydrocephalus patients are particularly vulnerable due to their life-long dependence on implanted catheters and suffer significantly due to high implant failure rate (>40% in year 1, >80% within a decade). Over one million Americans currently live with hydrocephalus, and require constant drainage of cerebrospinal fluid via implanted catheter. Repeated imaging studies and invasive procedures are used to monitor catheter performance, but these methods are expensive and inadequate. MRI/CT imaging can identify catheter failure in fewer than 50% of cases. Even when combined with invasive tests, patients are often misdiagnosed and undergo unnecessary surgery. Noninvasive monitoring of hydrocephalus catheter status could eliminate expensive tests and unnecessary operations, saving the US healthcare system $2 billion annually and immeasurably improve patient quality of life. Numerous other diseases in the cardiovascular, urinary, and renal spaces also require chronically implanted catheters and would benefit from noninvasive catheter monitoring. Improving catheter monitoring would also increase scientific knowledge of chronic diseases, providing an important tool for research and therapy development.

    This I-Corps project explores the commercialization potential for a multi-sensor catheter which can be implanted in the human body. Few sensors exist on the market that can operate for long periods in the human body. There are no suitable sensor technologies for chronically implanted catheters. This team developed a new sensor technology based on microscale electrodes that are low profile and eliminate the need for encapsulation or protection against the harsh environments found in vivo. They are made only of inert biocompatible materials, such as platinum and Parylene C, which have long been used in FDA approved medical implants. The pressure sensor operates by monitoring the response of a microbubble to changes in pressure. The flow sensor uses a microscopic heater and electrodes to measure heat transfer via flowing fluid. The sensor measures the electrical signal between electrodes inside and outside of a catheter to measure blockage. Clinical tests of these sensors are currently underway in pediatric patients with external ventricular drains.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to investigate the commercial potential of a developed power system for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with a high potential impact on military operations and commercial industries. Ultimately, the technology simply produces ultra-long endurance energy, and after proving the safety and reliability of the power system, can be expanded to other industries. For example, the power system could be used in an ultra-long endurance unmanned undersea vehicle, to power a desalination plant, or even just as a power source for buildings. As the miniaturization of the technology improves, the power system could also be used in consumer devices- providing ultra-long endurance power for cell phones, tablets, and laptops.

    This I-Corps project is commercializing a power system design that will produce 300W of electric power and weigh under 150 lbs. Detailed studies have supported the feasibility of the design of the power system. The power-to-weight ratio of this power system's design is similar to current unmanned aerial systems having proven flight capability. This comparison also supports the feasibility of the power system being used for powered flight, and potentially increasing UAV endurance to over one year.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to provide a new modality for delivering effective substance abuse interventions. This project involves a novel virtual-reality based intervention to be applied in substance abuse treatment. The team plans to investigate customer potential for a turnkey software intervention that can be integrated into the treatment of substance use disorders. This intervention may save lives and money by significantly reducing relapse rates.

    This I-Corps project explores how virtual reality may be an immediately available intervention to prevent relapse during periods of craving. Preliminary interviews suggest that virtual reality can regulate emotion for a period of hours or days after a brief 30-minute session. Substance abuse develops as a maladaptive response to strong negative emotions - if virtual reality can regulate emotion, it may serve as an alternative behavior that can be sought during potential moments of relapse. Prevention of relapse could combat the opioid epidemic and also help the millions of people who are addicted to other substances.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to increase the availability of cost-effective automated 3D bioprinting platforms capable of reconstructing biological tissue in situ. Existing bioprinting technology is limited and only available to institutions with vast amounts of resources, therefore limiting the potential it can bring to both academic and non-academic sectors. In industry, industry, many late stage trials can fail due to inaccurate drug testing and errors in the translational gap when using animal models. As an alternative, testing on 3D printed human tissue models could reduce costs as a valuable intermediate step before proceeding to animal model testing. Second, 3D bioprinting applications in pharmaceutical companies will increase throughput in drug screening. Third, researchers in academia can further advances in 3D biomaterial engineering. Fourth, with the education sector moving towards a Next Generation Science Standards curriculum, bioprinters have immense potential as an innovative tool for hands-on learning in the classroom. Educators can utilize 3D bioprinting as a powerful teaching tool to train and empower the next generation of scientists in pursuing their research. Ultimately, this project aims to create a positive impact and improve technological access worldwide for researchers and students alike.

    This I-Corps project is based on a core technology that allows researchers to print various tissue constructs. This bioprinter is able to reconstruct a viable skin construct using human fibroblasts and keratinocytes. The project?s minimum viable product (MVP) is a bioprinter with a multi-modular system using three different technologies. The technologies used in this product enable on-demand biomaterial customization during the construction of a 3D high-fidelity scaffold and precision placement of cells down to the micron level. Together, the combination of these modules creates a versatile product that has broad applications. This development will improve accessibility of the bioprinting technology and will further advancements in tissue engineering.

- abstractText: |-
    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to reduce production costs of high-quality stem and primary cells for regenerative medicine (RM), consequently reducing medical expenses and improving the quality of life for individuals. RM has a projected global market of $67.6 billion by 2020, and is capable of repairing, replacing and regenerating tissues and organs that are affected by disease/disorder, age, or injury. The common cell harvesting methods cause severe damage to cells, especially primary cells and stem cells. Our technology allows harvesting damage free cells, i.e., retaining essential cell functionalities and characteristics, which are superior for RM. Damage free cells will also enhance basic life science research by obtaining more clinical relevant results that cannot be achieved by using cell lines or damaged cells. While there is one commercially available thermo-responsive product being used to reduce cell damages during harvesting, it is too expensive to be adopted widely. Our technology is low cost, scalable, reproducible, and serves large growing markets. Through this project, we will identify key markets for adoption, correctly define the key product attributes, and understand scaling requirements, hence providing a source of high-quality stem and primary cells for critical medical research and applications.

    This I-Corps project will validate market potentials of applying thermo-responsive supports for damage free and chemical free cell harvesting, which is crucial for cell based regenerative medicine and basic life science research. Our technology for generating thermo-responsive supports employs a cost-effective and simple process that involves only 3 steps: blending, casting and thermal annealing of a thermo-responsive polymer and a network forming silane. During annealing, the silane molecules anchor to the surface while simultaneously forming networks to entrap polymer chains. Other reported thermo-responsive surfaces generally are prepared by using non-easily accessible electron beam irradiation or plasma polymerization to deposit a thermo-responsive layer, or painstakingly grow the thermo-responsive polymer on a surface. Also, as compared to the commercial product, our technology allows enhanced cell attachment and growth, and accelerated cell detachment upon cooling, thus avoiding cell damage. Therefore, our technology, described in research papers and patent protected, provides better platforms for commercial expansion of stem and primary cells and for basic research. In addition, our technology, with small scale samples, has been validated by another research group for a variety of applications.

    the use of innovative approaches to create real-world energy-absorbing, customizable
    materials that may be tailored to a range of markets and applications that provide
    tangible societal benefits. For example, this new technology could help patients
    suffering degenerative spinal disc disease by adding  material to replacement
    intervertebral discs. This application leads to reduced complication rates, improved
    shock absorption and biocompatibility, and overall increased patient satisfaction.
    The technology also provides a major public health benefit to athletes, the military,
    and others by providing superior energy dissipation in protective apparel. One
    such promising application is an additional lining material in football helmets
    to reduce the occurrence of concussions. Other potential fields include energy
    absorbing and vibration damping applications for the automotive or aerospace industries
    ranging from passenger safety and comfort to isolating critical electronic components
    in the event of impact, damage, and instability. Each of these applications aims
    to improve human health and safety, and represents billion dollars a year markets
    and hundreds of thousands of potential users. \n\nThis I-Corps project will combine
    the complementary properties of liquid crystalline elastomers (LCEs) and nickel-titanium
    (NiTi) to create a unique composite material that has exceptional mechanical properties,
    and a high degree of tailorable behavior. Research into LCEs has proven they have
    excellent energy absorbing behavior and toughness, with performance exceeding
    that of most other rubber-like materials. However, typical polyurethane rubbers
    or silicones are inherently soft and/or have a slow recovery from large deformations;
    this limits its usefulness in many important situations. NiTi is the ideal material
    to compliment these shortcomings due to its own set of unique characteristics.
    Similar to metals, it is orders of magnitude stronger and stiffer than LCEs, but
    NiTi also undergoes shape-memory behavior that leads large recoverable deformation.
    Additionally, it also provides biasing stress to the LCEs that should greatly
    reduce the recovery time of the composite material. The combination of these unique
    and varied properties will give the composite material a level of customization
    and tailored behavior that is simply not achievable with any of the constituents
    independently and will be of interest from both a research perspective and attractive
    as a marketable product.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has

    the introduction of a new microscopy modality, which enables non-contact mechanical
    mapping, and the development of the corresponding add-on module compatible to
    commercial confocal microscopy instruments. Confocal microscopy instruments are
    widely used in academia and industry but do not provide mechanical information
    of samples; mechanical testing instruments are also ubiquitous in both academia
    and industry but are contact-based. This project brings the non-contact mechanical
    testing capability to optical microscopy instruments. Beyond enabling traditional
    material characterizations with high spatio-temporal resolution, the instrument
    will be highly impactful in biomedical research. The past two decades have seen
    increasing recognition of the prominent role of the mechanical interplay between
    cells and their local microenvironment to regulate cell function. A widely utilized
    optical microscope for cell biomechanics would accelerate our understanding of
    mechano-chemical pathways and their role in the control of biological processes.
    Thus, this instrument is expected to be broadly used by biomedical researchers
    and material scientists in industry and academia to access cell, tissue and biomaterial
    mechanical properties without perturbing the sample and with high 3D resolution.
    \ \n\nThis I-Corps project explores the commercialization of an add-on module
    for confocal microscopes that features novel Brillouin spectroscopy.  Brillouin
    spectroscopy has been widely used for material testing and environmental sensing
    since the 1970's using specialized spectrometers that required 10 min to hours
    for a single measurement. In recent years, a new type of spectrometer was developed
    to improve speed of acquisition by several orders of magnitude and allowed to
    obtain 3D elasticity maps of biomaterials, biological cells and tissues. Thanks
    to the integration in commercial confocal microscopes, several highly impactful
    areas (e.g. stem cell lineage differentiation, malignancy transformation) will
    benefit from this technology as it enables gathering biomechanical information
    in environments and settings such as 3D microenvironments that mimic the in vivo
    conditions.  In addition, the instrument will enable the study of cell biomechanics
    on microfluidic platforms in order to control microenvironment conditions. Being
    compatible with traditional optical microscopes, this technology can also be combined
    with force mapping modalities thus enabling to investigate how cells sense mechanical
    stimuli and transduce them into biochemical signals.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project includes the development of an imaging system which addresses the current clinical need for a non-invasive imaging methodology that could image the skin over its depth with high resolutions while offering large histopathological contrasts between malignant and normal tissues. This will provide invaluable assistance to dermatologists with respect to improving tumor detection accuracies. The target market for this device would be the global dermatology diagnostic devices market which is expected to reach a value of USD 5.3 billion by the year 2025. Medical professionals who practice dermatology in clinics, established equipment manufacturers, and product distributors are the main stakeholders of this market. The proposed system will be ultimately integrated in a single framework, resulting in a compact (handheld) and real-time imaging device at very low manufacturing costs. By diagnosing tumors at an early stage, the proposed device will save tremendous amounts of time, effort, and patient discomfort and provide significant cost reductions for both the individual patient and the nation?s healthcare system.

    This I-Corps project investigates potential commercial markets for a new skin cancer imaging device developed based on the "Synthetic Ultra-Wideband Millimeter-wave Imaging" approach. In this approach, an ultra-wide imaging bandwidth in the millimeter-wave regime that cannot be realized by any conventional design method is assembled synthetically, resulting in significant improvements in the resolution of the acquired images. This approach is expected to enable the millimeter-wave imaging technology to be applied to skin imaging and skin cancer detection. The proposed technology has proven to be effective through proof-of-concept experiments. Firstly, statistically significant contrasts have been observed between the millimeter-wave dielectric properties of normal skin and two of the most common types of skin cancer, basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. These results verify the potential of the proposed system to provide histopathological-contrast-based evaluations of skin lesions. Furthermore, the feasibility of employing the proposed imaging method for skin cancer detection has been confirmed using realistic skin-mimicking phantoms containing spherical tumor models. The final developed product will be a hand-held, point-of-care millimeter-wave imaging device which provides significantly higher image resolutions compared to the state-of-the-art technology.

    to bring more usable technology to elderly populations to help them age with greater
    independence.  Specifically, existing in-home robots could assist a broader cohort
    of elderly users if the robots were easier to understand and use.  This is an
    especially timely opportunity as the elderly population is quickly growing in
    the United States. Elderly users need a robot that can express many internal states
    through external features, especially in an intuitive and interactive way. Choreographers
    and theater artists recognize how to convey narrative through context (set), movement
    (choreography), and commands (dialogue), therefore bringing a special expertise
    beyond typical product design processes.  Marrying this expertise with robotic
    hardware development has the potential to produce a significant transformation
    in how aging adults relate to and take advantage of technology in their homes.
    \ \n\nThis I-Corps project aims to explore the commercial potential of a three-part

    context-based behavior, with existing, low-cost robot hardware. For example, something
    as simple as a heart rate monitor has opaque, hard to interpret monitors, confusing
    multiple-step procedures, and an ominous beeping. This novel approach adds a customizable
    expressive layer to an existing device like this, creates a character-driven narrative
    about how the device works, and uses theatrical context which may improve user

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project are two-fold.  First, by combining virtual assistants as facilitators, an integrated system of scaffolds through the Design Notebook, and support for collaborative interactions both within a learning environment as well as virtually, the platform has the potential to provide a self-contained, self-paced, stand-alone online platform focused on culturally- and socially-relevant game design that has the potential to expose and support hundreds of thousands of learners who do not currently have access to these types of opportunities, programs, or platforms within their communities in the United States.  Second, the platform has the potential to support global collaborations between groups of learners through its ability to showcase work and its virtual play-testing capabilities that will allow users to give and receive substantive feedback about the design of a game, and thus inform its iterative design, from anywhere.

    This I-Corps project proposes a unique online platform with supporting scaffolds, that supports learners through game design for social change virtually in similar ways as the SCAT (Supporting Computational Algorithmic Thinking) project supported African-American middle-school girls face-to-face (DRK-12 #1150098).  SCAT and its scaffolds have been shown to be effective not only at helping African-American middle-school girls engage in Computing by designing games for social change, but also in improving their perceptions of themselves as critical thinkers and game designers with an intent to pursue game design or some STEM-related field as a result.  As such, the core technology of the platform is a stand-alone online platform that scaffolds learners through designing and implementing games (video or mobile) for social change as well as develops their computational algorithmic thinking capabilities.  It will be designed to leverage the affordances of the scaffolding in the SCAT Learning Environment including the facilitator, Design Notebook, and other Scholars.  The platform will contain several key integrated sub-tools that model and coach learners as they think through their designs, make connections, make design decisions, collect feedback to inform the iterative design of their games, ask questions of themselves and their peers, reflect on their experiences, and showcase what they have created.

    The broad impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to protect security and privacy of mobile device users with memorable, usable, and secure authentication schemes. According to statista.com, the number of smartphone users in the world will be more than five billion by 2019. The popularity of these mobile devices is due to a unique set of features including ubiquitous Internet access through communication technologies such as Wifi and 4G/LTE, easy to use touch-based inputs, and numerous applications and games. In the meantime, the security of mobile devices is becoming a major concern as device users are storing sensitive data such as personal contacts and utilizing sensitive applications like banking and stock trading. Strong authentication as the forefront defense mechanism can prevent unauthorized access to a mobile device that may lead to lack of accountability, data loss or stealing, and identity theft. Due to the popularity of mobile devices and their uses in government, business, and even military applications, securing mobile devices with secure, memorable, and usable authentication is of great societal importance.

    This I-Corps project focuses on exploring the market potential for multi-dimensional authentication schemes. The new paradigm of multi-dimensional authentication schemes can achieve better memorability, security, and usability at the same time. The new schemes fuse information from multiple dimensions to form a password, allowing the schemes to enlarge the password space and improve memorability by reducing memory interference. The information fusion can increase usability as fewer input gestures are required for passwords of the same security strength. The schemes can also be shoulder-surfing resistant. A successful authentication requires a user to respond to a random challenge so that a set of predefined rules are satisfied after adjustments made by the user. The schemes can also be used for continuously monitoring device user behavior to ensure the current device users is a user authorized to use the device. Through this project, we will be able to investigate the needs from various customer segments and polish our technologies and prototypes to meet the needs.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to create a new service technology to improve physical activity engagement by developing personalized physical activity prescriptions with market-available exergames and fitness mobile applications (fitness app). This technology is a theory- and research-based service process that targets maintaining physical activity engagement. The application has the potential to improve fitness function in individuals at any age and in any physical condition when he/she engages in physical activity. The technology can have several broader impacts on society: (1) as a nation, we are in need of creative solutions to improve the general health and fitness of our citizens; (2) according to the US Census bureau, in 2050, the 65+ age population is predicted to be over 80 million (twice that in 2012) who need to be fit; and (3) chronic illnesses result in significant reduction in productivity of the working population - the severity of illness can be reduced by improving the fitness of the individual.

    This I-Corps project aims (1) to determine what the customer segments and value propositions are for the technology; (2) to identify in what format the application should be delivered to make a market/product fit; and (3) to establish the readiness to transit the technology as an automated marketable service product. As of today, the technology exists as a manually prescribing procedure for patients who suffer from fatigue symptom. It has been thoroughly validated by pilot tests. Personalization features gauge and match multi-level factors, so the likelihood of adherence to the physical activity prescription is very high. The Exergame Grading Scheme is used to rate intensity of fitness attributes and energy expenditure of exergames and fitness app. The personalized physical activity prescriptions are generated by the Exergame Grading Scheme based algorithm, so that the prescription can challenge the individual's functional capacity. The intellectual merit lies in: (1) identifying the right combination of hardware/software technologies that can accurately implement the product; and (2) implementing a solution that is scalable in mass volumes with low cost per unit.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    based on the characteristics of the Augmented Reality WEarable Device (ARWED)
    for training of post-stroke patients, allowing, for example, the user to perceive
    an impaired arm as healthy. Preliminary training protocols, incorporated within
    the ARWED, make the system a reliable solution that is expected to be broadly
    utilized by medical professionals working in rehabilitation, sports therapy ,and
    convalescence. Although the ARWED has been developed mainly for the physical training
    of post-stroke patients, the project's explorations are expected to provide effective
    tools for the physical rehabilitation of patients with limb limitations at any
    scale -- ranging from individuals suffering partial loss of motor ability to those
    with severe limitations in mobility due to strokes, birth defects or accidents.
    Since observational learning may offer greater benefits regarding transfer to
    Activities of Daily Living (ADLs), in comparison to robotic-based stroke training,
    the medical community would also benefit from the development of the ARWED. Insights
    into how training using technology may enhance the recovery of motor control in
    diverse populations while providing a novel intervention that may prove more effective
    than what is currently available. \n\nThis I-Corps project centers on exploiting
    the link between action-observation and action execution in order to develop training
    protocols, based on observational learning techniques, to facilitate rehabilitation
    following a neurological disorder. Such a disorder may range from such catastrophic
    events as stroke or a spinal cord injury. Currently, there are limited systems
    that utilize virtual reality in the relearning of biological movements. The development
    of the ARWED required solving several challenges in computer vision, modeling,
    and robot motion. The current testing of the effectiveness of the device requires
    combined expertise from the areas of biomechanics, signal analysis, virtual reality,
    robotic fault recovery theory and rehabilitation. Therefore, the theoretical contributions
    emerging from this collaborative research is expected to advance knowledge and
    understanding not only within the medical field, but also across the above-mentioned
    research areas. The multidisciplinary nature of the research will lead to the
    education of undergraduate and graduate students in the areas of Engineering,
    Medicine and Kinesiology, among others. The outcomes of the project will facilitate
    a dialogue between Physical/Occupational Therapy and Engineering students and
    professionals that can aid in the human recovery following neurological disorders
    efforts.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the expansion of facial recognition technologies into the emissive infrared bands and the reduction of false negatives in the presence of large facial pose variation.  Visible 2-D image-based machine learning techniques dominate the commercial facial recognition landscape while heterogeneous facial recognition techniques including 3-D to 2-D matching and infrared to visible matching have not seen similar widespread commercial deployment.  The patented technology originates from an NSF Award and brings a crucial algorithmic component for commercial deployment that enhances heterogeneous facial recognition techniques while not relying on machine learning nor its concomitant large training database requirements.  This in turn opens up the potential for improved automated surveillance against a given watch-list deployable in a host of public and private spaces and under a wider range of surveillance conditions than currently possible using 2-D commercial matching algorithms.

    This I-Corps project is a result of technology developed under an NSF Award which enables a radical improvement in 3-D facial recognition by reducing the computational costs for facial implicit surface generation and biometric capture originating from multispectral (visible and infrared) sources.  The technology results in robust recognition in the presence of large facial pose variation and occlusion using 3-D facial implicit surfaces.  The improvement over existing 2-D commercial facial recognition algorithms is evident under conditions typical of automated surveillance where large facial pose variation and poor lighting result in false negatives using conventional practice.  The method and apparatus for 3-D facial recognition underlying this research, however, performs equally well under large facial pose variation and is able to seamlessly integrate multiple band infrared input along with visible image input for vastly lower false negative facial recognition even in the presence of low-light and nighttime conditions.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    safer and more reliable 3D printed metal structures, also commercially known as
    additive manufactured parts.  The project will explore the needs of the 3D printing
    industry as the technology is applied to ever more demanding areas such as aerospace
    and automotive.  In aerospace, each component must be produced by a verified and
    validated procedure, and in-situ inspection can meet that need.  In the automotive
    industry, representative components must be evaluated to verify production procedures
    and equipment operation; again, in-situ inspection can meet this need.   In addition
    to aerospace and automotive, 3D printed metal structures are expected to have
    wide commercial applications, ranging from health to defense.  In these applications,
    safety and reliability are paramount.  For example, a 3D printed replacement for
    a broken bone must be highly resistant to breakage itself.  However, the mass
    limitations for a bone replacement require efficiency in design and a trust in
    fabrication.  \n\nThis I-Corps project is a non-destructive evaluation (NDE) method
    that is used to observe the metal structure while it is being printed or upon
    completion of the manufacturing process.  Historically, metal parts must be subjected
    to destructive inspection methods to meet high reliability requirements after
    manufacturing.  This alternative NDE is based on a novel X-ray imaging method,
    grating-based interferometry, first introduced about ten years ago.  In this method,
    micro-fabricated X-ray optics are used to enhance the X-ray image, especially
    for the detection of sub-micron features.  The traditional X-ray image is improved
    with an overlay image that reveals the presence of sub-micron features.  Recently,
    sub-micron features in 3D printed metal components have been correlated with preliminary
    crack formation under fatigue stress.  Therefore, an X-ray grating-based interferometry
    image of a freshly printed structure (either in-progress or completed) can reveal
    the presence of failure points.  By demonstrating the viability of this unique
    NDE methodology to potential users of 3D printed parts, it is anticipated that
    new market segments can gain sufficient confidence in part reliability to incorporate
    these 3D printed parts into critical components.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's

    of overweight trucks could significantly decrease the tens of billions of dollars
    per year of roadway damage caused by these overweight trucks.  An additional benefit

    to monitor the structural deformations of civil structures in real-time. The intent
    of this technology is to augment/replace existing systems that rely on load cells
    at weigh stations.  The technology measures the deformation of structures under
    dynamic loads with a passive camera system that can monitor the structure from
    a distance. The system uses off-the-shelf commercially available video cameras
    to monitor a specific target on a structure, such as a fastener, reflector, or
    structural feature. The real-time video is then processed using proprietary pixel
    manipulation algorithms to calculate sub-millimeter displacements and rotations
    in 3 axes. The information, when observed in real-time, as well as the data products
    generated from the archived data can be used to determine the performance of structures,
    the impacts of dynamic loading, and even the prediction of structural failures.
    The system can also be used to identify overweight trucks in order to enforce

    that it provides structure and equipment for simulation and training of low-level

    societal-cost disaster is critical to our national safety and homeland security.
    \ This project's solution can be used for training the military, industry, fire
    and police departments, bomb squads, HAZMAT teams, paramedics, and emergency medicine
    physicians. The device may be ideal for training anyone who comes into contact,
    or who has the potential to come into contact with radiation. Training saves lives

    devices (RED), nuclear accidents, or improvised nuclear devices (IND).  \n\nThis
    I-Corps project uses RFID (radiofrequency identification) tags in combination
    with GPS (global positioning satellite) technology to mimic low-level to absolutely
    lethal level radiation without use of dangerous radioisotopes.  This is important
    because the vast majority of radiation training in the past has used low level

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project stems
    from the fact that the micro-textured surface proposed in this project can reduce
    drag - the force experienced by an object moving through air or water. Ground
    transportation vehicles, airplanes, drones, underwater vessels, wind turbines,
    and HVAC fans all experience the adverse effects of drag in terms of increased
    fuel/electricity consumption, increased greenhouse gas emissions, and reduced
    energy production. Potential efficiency gains using the proposed technology can
    save numerous industries significant energy costs, reduce greenhouse gas emissions,
    and solve a multitude of problems associated with aerodynamic/hydrodynamic inefficiencies.
    For example, a 5% increase in efficiency due to drag reduction translates to $5
    billion in fuel savings for the trucking industry and the equivalent energy production
    of an additional 2000 wind turbines per year for the wind energy industry. Micro-textured
    surfaces for passive flow control presents a unique opportunity in enhancing efficiency
    in that it can be designed for optimal performance depending on the application
    to yield the highest possible efficiency gains. \n\nThis I-Corps project features
    a micro-structured coating inspired by shark-skin, which passively modifies the
    flow close to the surface of an object resulting in drag reduction both in air
    and water applications. Experimental results performed using the section of a
    wind turbine airfoil in a water tunnel showed that the proposed micro-structured
    film, made out of a commercially available polyurethane, can delay and reduce
    the size of the separation bubble, the phenomenon responsible for increased drag,
    by 60%. The effect of this reduction on drag was also confirmed in wind tunnel
    experiments. Reductions of up to 30% and 13% were recorded over an airfoil and
    a cylinder, respectively. Additionally, enhancements of up to 45% in lift generated
    by an airfoil was measured when the micro-structured coating was applied to the
    surface. The ability of the proposed technology to increase fuel and conversion
    efficiencies will have a transformative impact in many industries including ground

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is a lead enrichment kit that can allow fast detection of lead in water with low cost and low detection limit. Lead contamination in drinking water is a threat to human beings. Due to its health concern, the Lead and Copper Rule (LCR) has set an action level of 15 µg/L for lead in tap water. Considering the great threat of lead to health even with low concentrations, it is necessary to have lead measurements in water at a regular basis. The proposed project aims to commercialize an inexpensive kit which would allow fast lead detection in water with low detection limit to meet Lead and Copper Rule (15 ppb). The kit provides two main benefits to customers: a lower cost ($4) than current kit ($11) for lead detection which meets Lead and Copper Rule and convenience for field sample measurements.

    This I-Corps project aims to evaluate the commercial adoption of our inexpensive lead enrichment kit for lead detection. Interviews will be conducted to help identify the potential customers and the market needs, evaluate the commercialization feasibility of the new technology, and optimize the technology to meet the demand of targeted customers. Inspired by findings from our current NSF-project, special enrichment kit was designed to accumulate Pb from water, allowing quick detection of lead in water with low concentrations using the inexpensive detection kit. Additionally, the proposed work will provide the basis for future development and commercialization of new enrichment kits to detect other aqueous contaminants in water with low detection limits.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will be to enable companies and end-users to more easily extract relevant information from data sources. This system can be beneficial for a wide range of companies including e-commerce, business intelligence, and database and could systems. It is envisioned that this technology will be used in two ways: First, companies can use the system internally to enable easier and faster data access for their employees, thereby reducing dependence on database administrators and cutting costs. Second, companies could use the system externally to provide a better search interface to their customers. In addition, this technology can potentially also be useful to academic researchers, particularly within social and natural sciences, by allowing them to easily extract relevant data.

    This I-Corps project provides an interface for extracting data from databases by writing English sentences. Although relational databases are the most common choice for the storage of information, retrieving a relevant subset of the data from them requires expertise in a formal query language. This technology allows end-users to query information stored in a relational database without having to learn a formal query language. The technology is based on a research which combines advanced natural language processing techniques with automated program synthesis and repair. A key advantage of this approach is that it is database-agnostic and does not require end-users to know the database schema.

    The broader impact of this I-Corps project is to promote the use of drones in agriculture and natural resource commercial endeavors and research. Due to scale, logistics, and lack of rural broadband internet access, there is a surprising lack of data in agriculture and agronomic research. At the same time, farmers and agronomists are in one way or another adapting to precision agriculture crop management and need high-resolution data at the landscape scale. This project will drastically reduce the time needed to generate accurate crop growth metrics from drone imagery, and then act on the information. Development of this project will improve data-driven decision-making in agriculture and agronomic research, including plant breeding and sustainable crop management. Data from our technology can be used for drone-based yield prediction for economic and value-chain applications, with information provided sooner than is available from current methods.

    This I-Corps project will reduce the cost and time to analyze unmanned aircraft system imagery of crop fields for quantification of metrics describing crop health, growth, and development, proactively during the season. The technology is software and workflows that use techniques from remote sensing, photogrammetry, and computer vision to automatically extract replicate images of research plots and management zones from raw drone imagery of crop fields, instead of relying on expensive and massive image ortho-mosaics and high-grade GPS measurements for plot extraction and analysis. The innovation can be applied in the field by eliminating the need for internet access or high-performance computers. The innovation also provides custom zoning of metrics, and quality control of the data generated. The innovation is an inexpensive method of high-throughput field phenotyping in the plant sciences. The innovation can contribute significantly to early-season yield prediction for a range of decision-making and forecasting applications. Implementation of regular consideration of growth analysis using inexpensive aerial imagery in the seed industry will improve genetic gain and product placement in precision agriculture management zones. Precision agriculture management will be facilitated by real-time, responsive, high-resolution assessments of crop health. Improved crop modeling and yield predictions are economically valuable to many sectors.

    related to the development of fluorescent materials. Commercial potential is expected
    to emerge when replacing costly existing technologies (like quantum dots) with
    inexpensive materials able that can be embodied as highly fluorescent organic
    solids. Such materials are expected to create new value and have commercial potential
    in several markets in which either aesthetics, brightness, or color transmission
    is critical for performance. Our primary markets of interest are colorants in
    paints and polymers. Fluorescent brighteners represent an important segment of
    the global dyes and pigments market (a >$30B per year industry). We believe our
    technology can expand this segment by streamlining the formulation and processing
    of fluorescent materials, and by broadening the available color palate. Immediate
    applications would arise in creation of new fluorescent paints and coatings for
    construction and safety applications, and may also provide new user-friendly color
    options to the growing market for 3D printing materials. We anticipate additional
    downstream applications to arise in customized biolabeling technologies and solar
    power generation. If successful, the broader impacts also include the training
    of scientists in the process of commercialization. \n\nThis I-Corps project provides
    a universal tool to address the outstanding intellectual challenge of understanding
    how to reverse loss of fluorescence from solid-state formulations of organic dyes.
    The intellectual merits will derive from new synthetic preparations of fluorescent
    dye and pigment technology by a method called small molecule isolation lattices,
    or SMILES. This project derives from research that has provided a way to insulate
    the color-carrying dye molecules from one another allowing their fluorescence
    to be rescued. A wide range of proof-of-principle experiments shows how to prepare
    the SMILES materials simply by mixing a proprietary compound with existing fluorescent
    compounds. The results show fluorescence in solids, as films, crystals, dyes,
    and particles under identical conditions that render conventional fluorescent
    dyes non-emissive.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to develop aerogel-based catalysts as a sustainable, environmentally friendly material for pollution mitigation applications. These materials could reduce or even eliminate the use of expensive precious metals such as platinum, palladium and rhodium that are currently used in automotive exhaust after-treatment systems. Thus, aerogel catalysts could have a significant positive economic and environmental impact on this nation.  Commercialization of these novel materials will extend the design space available to pollution-control system engineers, and hence open new, potentially transformative, avenues for meeting current and future pollution regulations. In addition, this project will enable undergraduate students to develop entrepreneurial ideas and learn what is involved in bringing technology developed through fundamental research to the marketplace.

    This I-Corps project will explore commercial opportunities for catalytic aerogels. Aerogels are materials with remarkable properties, including unusually high surface area, low density, low thermal conductivity and a nanoporous structure that is stable at high temperatures. Aerogels can be fabricated using a rapid supercritical extraction method and tailored to contain different catalytic metal species such as copper, cobalt, vanadia and alumina. Research in this area is focused on developing methods for making different types of catalytic aerogels and on testing their effectiveness in pollution mitigation applications. Catalytic testing of copper-alumina aerogels under simulated automotive exhaust conditions has demonstrated that they are capable of converting unburned hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide into less harmful gases.

    to improve the literacy of blind people by enabling improved access to digital

    to digest digital context. However, listening does not delivery the same sense
    of immediacy and literacy as reading braille. Also, audio technology and single
    line displays cannot deliver spatial information, e.g. mathematical equations,
    diagrams, and graphs, which are critical to literacy in science, technology, and
    math-related subjects.  Commercial electronic tactile displays exist, but due
    to the complexity and cost of the underlying technology, the devices are prohibitively

    can improve literacy rates, education outcomes and overall lifestyle of blind

    a patented microfluidic technology for developing a full-page tactile display.
    Based on the technology, a microfluidic chip can reduce the complexity and cost
    of controlling a large number of densely-packed pneumatic actuators. A large array
    of thousands of individually controllable features is possible. The pneumatic
    actuators are integrated directly into the microfluidic chip using large-scale
    integration, making the device low-cost and highly scalable. Pressure-based actuation
    ensures that even tightly placed features will maintain relatively high force

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will directly affect the treatment and management of the over 80 km3 of wastewater and solid wastes produced each year in the US. Waste treatment processes are directly tied to environmental and human health in both developed and developing countries but are subject to high costs due to significant energy and maintenance requirements. Municipal wastewater treatment alone accounts for about 3% of electrical energy consumed in the U.S and other developed countries. The successful implementation of the proposed technology, which integrates artificial intelligence (AI) into existing waste treatment infrastructure, has the potential to greatly improve the management of microbial communities associated with treatment processes thereby improving overall effectiveness and sustainability. This solution represents a new way for customers to cut energy and operational costs and improve effectiveness of their treatment processes without large investments in infrastructure. Potential markets for this technology include public, municipal facilities in addition to treatment facilities in the industrial/agricultural sector.  Development of the proposed technology will likely spur additional applications of AI systems in other fields centered around microbial community based engineered systems like bioproduct production, biosensing, and bioremediation.

    This I-Corps project is based on our recent development of a machine learning based approach used to accurately predict microbial community structure, process stability, and reactor performance for wastewater treatment. This novel approach, which incorporates genomic data along with environmental and operational parameters into data-mining datasets has demonstrated significant increases in accurately predicting process stability and performance of small-scale wastewater systems compared to models developed without consideration of microbial community dynamics. The predictive models developed through the construction of artificial neural networks have potential to inform engineering decisions for optimized performance and stability of environmental biotechnologies in full-scale systems. Development and implementation of this approach will not only progress the understanding and control of microbial communities that inhabit environmental biotechnologies but may be expanded to other microbiomes such as those associated with human health and biogeochemical cycles.

The framework brings together computational thinking, design process, and programming to meet STEM imperatives and provide compelling value propositions for both the education and prototyping industry. The proposed robotics framework has the potential to fill 2.5 million unfilled jobs in STEM and positively impact the U.S. educational robotics market, which is expected to grow to $2.7 billion by 2021.

    This I-Corps project leverages the latest research in mechanism synthesis area to create novel algorithms for designing motions of planar linkage mechanisms. Planar linkage mechanisms are rigid bodies connected to one another using rotating or sliding joints and their special configurations give rise to desired motion. Their implementation in a mobile app provides users an ability to synthesize and simulate mechanisms for robots and machines. While, the robot hardware kit employs inexpensively produced novel planar and compliant pieces to create a new method of interconnection to realize three-dimensional geometry and mechanisms of robots and structures, the web-based CAD tool would allow users to design customized robot parts. The flexibility of the design allows for the use of any programming platform and any readily available sensors and actuators thereby dramatically broadening the inventions design capabilities.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps is a novel noninvasive ventilation modality for treatment of mild and severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients.  Two million Americans have such severe COPD that, even on maximal medical therapy, they are unable to walk up a single flight of stairs due to severe shortness of breath. As the disease progresses, patients become bound to their house, their chair, and finally their bed. This technology provides a non-intrusive pulmonary support to patients in a form of a lightweight, mobile, and noninvasive ventilator, which can help support these patients during physical activity and help them live a full life again, free of suffocation. Long term impacts of this technology include: (1) increased quality of life and treatment effectiveness for severe COPD patients; (2) development of novel pulmonary rehabilitation therapies; (3) expansion of noninvasive ventilation technology in the field of pulmonary care to supplement and enhance current ventilation techniques.

    This I-Corps project is a mobile, non-invasive ventilation technology targeted at COPD patients. The device works by supplementing patient's breathing with pressure changes on their chest and abdomen. With each breath in, the device generates a vacuum that helps lift the chest and abdomen, helping the patient breathe in.  With each breath out, the device increases pressure over the chest and helps the patient breath out faster.  By assisting the work of breathing, patients no longer feel short of breath and can once again engage in normal daily activities. The device promotes a healthy breathing cycle, which prevents hyperinflation of the airways and degeneration of alveoli in the lungs. Noninvasive ventilation and pulmonary rehabilitation have both been shown to have significant, positive effects on the quality of life and medical outcomes of COPD patients. The technology aims to improve patient's well-being.

    rural or suburban areas with limited medical services, 4) senior living and retirement
    communities, 5) health insurance companies, and 6) ophthalmic instrument manufacturers.
    Eye diseases are usually detected in clinics with ophthalmic devices, e.g. optical
    coherence tomography, corneal topography and slit lamp, which are large, expensive
    and not portable, and need to be operated by trained technicians. However, our
    proposed smartphone-based eye disease detection method is small, affordable, portable,
    and it can be operated by patients in a convenient way, which will overcome the
    limitations mentioned above. The proposed algorithm can detect eye diseases or
    monitor eye healthiness in a proper and timely manner, and it can share the monitoring
    information with ophthalmologists. Hence, eye diseases can be detected in the
    earlier stage with our technology.  Moreover, ophthalmologist can focus more on
    severe treatments or surgeries. A 5- to 10-fold lower cost is an added potential
    benefit. \n\nThis I-Corps project will explore the commercial potential of a new
    eye disease detection technology using a smartphone and make it broadly available

    a smartphone-based eye disease detection technology that is more accurate and

    smartphone-based eye disease detection technology makes use of panoramic images
    or short video recordings of the eye at different angles. The recorded eye images
    are divided into iris, lens, sclera, and cornea components using automatic image
    cropping techniques. Each divided component is then analyzed using shape detection
    and color matching techniques to recognize the shape and to detect the abnormality
    of each component, respectively. Preliminary finding shows that the proposed technology
    detects keratoconus with more than 90% accuracy from 30 subjects. To detect diverse
    types of eye diseases and to increase the accuracy of eye disease detection, we
    will collect additional eye data from patients and normal subjects to form a larger
    database, and apply machine learning techniques to the accumulated database. Bringing
    these innovative capabilities to the commercial market will significantly improve
    discovery output in academia and industry.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to decrease health care costs for sleep apnea monitoring and diagnosis. It is estimated that a large proportion of potential sleed apnea patients are undiagnosed. Sleep apnea is a potentially remedial risk factor for hypertension, type II diabetes, stroke, coronary artery disease, and heart failure. Sleep apnea also causes learning disability among children. The proposed sleep apnea screening tool is accurate and easy to use. It can potentially be broadly employed in clinics and homes, and reduce the need for both overnight laboratory-based polysomnograms and home sleep studies.

    This I-Corps project targets to provide an easy-to-use screening tool for sleep apnea that combines mobile technology, internet of things (IoT) technology, and machine learning technology into one system.  The core technology of this screening tool is the state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms with IoT sensors. The solution is expected to deliver a high accuracy and sensitivity sleep apnea screening methodology using deep learning methods. Preliminary results are consistent with six types of apnea-hypopnea index threshold.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to translate quantum communication technological breakthroughs into real-life applications. This goal will bring significant social and economic impacts as quantum communication has the potential to revolutionize the global telecommunication industry. Commercially, this vision provides countless opportunities to interact with a broad spectrum of entities such as telecom companies, financial firms, defense agencies and banking corporations. It is predicted that advanced quantum technologies driven by quantum information processing will revolutionize traditional communication methods by enabling the ultimate security for the transmission of cryptography keys, based on the fundamental laws of quantum mechanics which facilitate detecting any eavesdropping attempt on the encoded key.

    This I-Corps project is devoted to developing portable modular hardware necessary to build a protected cryptographic network immune to known attacks.  This technology is designed to overcome the main challenge of operation over extended distances of thousands of kilometers, as required to establish secure communication networks between cities and countries. The team has successfully designed and built commercialization-friendly quantum devices including quantum light sources, characterization units, and quantum memories aimed to store and transform quantum information in a manner needed for secure communication. These devices are room temperature operational and do not require cumbersome and expensive infrastructure, thus being ready for outside of the laboratory operation. This quantum toolbox is currently being used in different international locations as a test-bed of important capabilities, such as entanglement distribution, ultrafast operations, and satellite communication compatibility.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will result in higher performing polymeric photonic materials (plastics which interact with light) which will have extensive application in consumer devices such as computers, cell phones, lighting units, telecommunications, cameras, and sensors.  Polymeric photonic materials are finding evermore application in devices due to their low weight, high-impact resistance, and ability to be fabricated into unique shapes/architectures, however, have paltry optical performance when compared to their heavier, costlier glass counterparts.  The material developed here combines the existing positive attributes of polymeric optical materials while offering significantly higher performance without large increases in price.

    This I-Corps project will develop high optical quality crosslinked polymer networks with the unique ability to be remolded, reshaped, and repurposed when placed under the correct conditions without loss of mechanical integrity or optical properties.  Polymeric optical components (lenses, waveguides, etc.) are desirable over fragile and heavy glass counterparts, however, defects and birefringence (stresses which negatively interact with light) prevent polymers from being used for applications requiring high optical quality materials.  This proprietary technology allows for microscopic scrambling of chemical bonds to occur in the polymeric materials only when it is placed under certain conditions, effectively annealing out the aforementioned defects and birefringence in the polymer, giving high optical quality materials.  Current research is focused on taking this dynamic platform and placing it into commercially relevant resins that fabricate tough, robust, optically clear, high performance materials.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is providing a possible paradigm shift in antimicrobial therapy and in treating antibiotic resistant bacteria in a multitude of fields including healthcare, agriculture, water treatment, and veterinary. The ability to directly target drug resistant strains of various microbes can provide a vital impact on the state of global medicine. The CDC estimates more than 2 million people become infected with antibiotics resistant bacteria yearly, with at least 23,000 deaths due to antibiotic resistant infections. The use and availability of a natural nanomaterial that can innately affect the growth of various strains of microbes will enable wider access to antimicrobial applications.  Aside from this potential for direct use, nano-antibiotics can also possibly be used to treat water systems, enabling a broad new market application.

    This I-Corps project stems from the core technology which enables selective targeting of infections inside human patients while denying the bacteria access to the traditional mechanisms through which drug resistance develops. The aim is to address the need for modern solutions to drug-resistant infections with engineered nano-antibiotics that are capable of reversing drug resistance in bacteria. These nano-antibiotics combine the genetic specificity of nucleic acids with a physically-active vector with therapeutic capability. A stimuli-responsive function is added to allow the nanoparticle to be tunable to specific infections as needed, while maintaining a wide-spectrum usability. This therapeutic strategy is unique not just because gene silencing is used to remove drug resistant properties from multi-drug resistant bacteria, a delivery vector that has the capability to kill the microbe is also used. This approach is generalizable, and can potentially be implemented to treat any bacterial infection that has become resistant to conventional antibiotics.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to provide enhanced capabilities for improved management of forest resources via aerial reforestation. Sustainable forest management practices are important to decrease soil erosion, increase biodiversity, sequester carbon and meet future demand for timber and biomass supply to the pulp, paper, wood, and energy sectors. Reforestation (natural or assisted) of cleared or degraded land is an important management objective to achieve these goals. Management costs of private forest lands have increased over time particularly for small-scale private landowners. Unmanned aerial vehicles, equipped with customized hardware and software, have the ability to replace or supplement conventional assisted-reforestation practices (hand planting or mechanical) and provide a cost-effective alternative. This project's approach to reforestation can increase accessibility to physically remote or topographically constrained locations that are difficult to access with large heavy machinery and vehicles.

    This I-Corps project will explore the commercial viability of a data driven management system for assisted reforestation efforts. The system is designed to plant seeds using unmanned aerial vehicles outfitted with customized hardware. The system hardware is capable of projecting customize seed pellets into a range of soil conditions and at penetration depths necessary for successful germination. Coupled to the system is a machine learning algorithm that provides data metrics on forest land holdings using remotely sensed images. The machine learning algorithm can be trained, based on data type and quantity, for more accurate and reliable analysis. These data enable private landowners to assess overall conditions of their holdings, facilitate development of reforestation plans, and determine flight patterns. In addition, the algortihm is capable of communicating and guiding the unmanned aerial vehicle's autonomous guidance system to direct field planting.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is that the project device has the potential to become the next generation of ultra-low power devices. Tunnel Field Effect Transistors (TFETs), especially those with type III-V heterostructures, are excellent candidates to overcome both size and power scaling issue of Silicon metal?oxide?semiconductor field-effect transistor (Si MOSFET). III-V heterojunction TFET can easily achieve low power consumption by having high on-current and low off-current within a very short range of applied voltage. One of the bottlenecks for III-V materials to become mainstream is the lack of integration with current silicon manufacturing technology. The proposed device demonstrates technology that is compatible with silicon manufacturing technology which has the most commercial impact compared to any other III-V materials devices as it does not require any changes in the existing manufacturing process. By realizing this device, it will open the opportunity to replace the current existing FinFET technology in cellphone and computers, making a new generation of portable devices for logic applications and enabling ever-connected internet of things applications.

    This I-Corps project proposes to create a low power tunneling field effect transistor (TFET) on a silicon substrate using novel fabrication techniques. The device employs InAs/AlSb/GaSb junction as the tunneling junction. This unique junction produces effective modulation of electron tunneling under control of the applied gate bias. The tunneling barrier AlSb layer is sandwiched between InAs and GaSb. This configuration allows the free band movements between InAs and GaSb. This unique junction is combined with a fin type channel structure to allow effective control over the active channel region by the surrounding gate metals. The fin device architecture will allow excellent gate electro-static control, and combining it with the tunneling mechanism will enable the fabricated devices to achieve a subthreshold slope much smaller than 60mV/dec. Another unique aspect of the proposed design is the use of elevated asymmetric T-shaped source and drain.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of improved magnetic nanoparticles with safer profiles for biomedical applications. One specific market would be contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Current gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) cannot be administered to patients with poor renal function, and more recent clinical studies indicated long-term residual gadolinium deposition in the brains of healthy patients. As gadolinium is the source of safety concerns for current GBCAs, one possible solution is to replace gadolinium with bio-compatible iron-oxides that offer similar contrast enhancement. Conventional iron-based MRI contrast agents have a broad particle size distribution which results in undesired side effects and performance variability. The technology developed here enables tight control of particle size distribution and physicochemical properties, which improves the agent's performance and safety profile. Moreover, an iron-based contrast agent can be used as a contrast agent for magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of peripheral vascular diseases.

    This I-Corps project further develops a technology that enables the explicit control of the physicochemical properties of iron-oxide nanoparticles. These nanoparticles offer potential as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) contrast agents that overcome the safety limitations of currently used alternatives. Iron-oxide nanoparticles have been previously approved for clinical use as MRI contrast agents but were discontinued from the market due to variable performance and safety concerns - primarily due to formulations with a broad size distribution. The technology developed here enables the production of iron-oxide nanoparticles with highly controlled physiochemical properties and low batch-to-batch variability which yield reproducible MRI results. This homogenous formulation is expected to have more controlled pharmacokinetics and biodistribution profiles compared to conventional iron-based agents.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to improve predictivity in preclinical pharmaceutical research and development to lower drug development costs and to improve drug approval rates. Recent cost estimates for developing a prescription drug is $2.6 billion over the 10-year development period, and the annual drug approval rate is as low as 20-30 drugs, while hundreds of drugs candidates fail each year. The failure rates of a large percentage of drug candidates at the clinical trial increase the overall costs of approved drugs. Replacing simplistic 2D cell culture models and animal models with human organ-on-a-chip (OoC) technologies will provide human-specific solutions for drug development. These tests can provide stronger predictions and confidence to advance the right drug candidates to clinical trials and also identify problem candidates early to save time and money associated with progressing the wrong compounds through expensive clinical trials.

    This I-Corps project provides an integrative solution to the pharmaceutical industry for preclinical drug testing using Organ-on-a-Chip (OoC) technologies with companion computational tools. OoC technologies, which are micro-engineered systems combining living 3D human cells, fluidic channels, and biomaterials, emulate biological and physiological processes of the real organ in vitro. The need for more physiologically relevant in vitro systems for preclinical efficacy and toxicity testing has led to a major effort to develop OoC technologies. OoC approaches have been recognized as emerging technologies with potential to revolutionize medical research and drug discovery. However, OoC technologies require specialized operational infrastructure including instrumentation and an experienced tissue engineering team not common in industry. By providing a specialized service model, the benefits of human-relevant OoCs become accessible by bridging the gap between pharmaceutical companies, OoC companies, and academia.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is expected to primarily address the needs of the pharmaceutical industry, but is also relevant to a broader range of biological applications. The cost of pharmaceutical drug discovery has increased by nearly 150% in the past 10 years, averaging about $2.6 billion to develop just one drug. A major contributing factor is the inefficacy of pre-clinical studies that still typically use simple 2D cell cultures as experimental models which do not accurately recapitulate the complexity of 3D, multicellular physiological environments. The development of a modular multi-printhead bioprinter will enable a wide variety of materials to be incorporated into the 3D printed tissues. As a result, researchers in pharmaceutical companies will receive a cost-effective means to streamline drug development, leading to increased productivity in bringing medications to market.

    This I-Corps project aims to investigate the commercialization potential of a modular, multi-printhead bioprinter. This bioprinting system solves the current limitations with two key features. Firstly the multiple dispensing mechanisms can collectively process a wide range of materials. Several printheads each specialized in different materials and printing styles allow 3D, 2D, extrusion, or droplet printing of cell-laden fluids of all viscosities with minimal stress and high resolutions. Secondly, this is a modular design that allows the customization of a bioprinter to a customer's specifications. The system supports the construction and operation of bioprinters with any combination of the different printheads to match the customer's price point and research needs. The combination of these features enables the customer to create complex biological tissues of their design.

    The broader impact of this I-Corps project is in allowing survivors of physical and neurological events to regain autonomy over their rehabilitation. While the proposed work focuses on stroke survivors, there is direct translation to the assessment, assistance, and management of other conditions, as well as use in general training after injury, and in industry to improve efficiency and reduce the risk of injury. There is a potential commercial opportunity in addressing the needs of intervention providers in quantifying the efficacy of their equipment and healthcare providers in allowing for contextualization of patients. Traditional rehabilitation equipment tends to be affordable but difficult to use, resulting in low efficacy and adherence; comparatively, new rehab equipment provides greater efficacy, but is typically more expensive. With drastically lowered manufacturing costs, novel actuation and quantified sensors, and clearer outputs for patient users, this device can provide quantifiable data for evaluation through instantaneous self-motivating metrics. This approach has the potential to disrupt the standard paradigms of rehabilitation.

    This I-Corps project is informed by research in human-assistive, robotic, technologies. It further develops an affordable, variable-dosage exoskeleton (APEX), a wearable upper-body device to support and assist the limbs, uniquely powered by pneumatic-actuators, and adaptive to address specific user needs through feedback loops of communicative sensors and modeling. By changing the pressures in the device's actuators, APEX assists through gravitational support, passive stretching of joints, and resistance exercises. A series of device-embedded sensors and defined exercises enable the creation of patient-specific models, incorporating limb lengths, masses, ranges of motion, and strengths.  By varying the protocol based on a patient's abilities, support can be provided on a spectrum by selectively changing the amount of assistance or resistance. Because APEX utilizes low-cost, low-mass, pneumatic-actuators rather than DC motors, it significantly reduces power consumption and prolongs the capacity of the device. This allows for patients to use the device in their own home, and track progress on a simplified interface - the analytics of which are sent back to their therapist, trainer, or physician.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is in its capability to promote the safety of people with dementia. According to research, 70% of people with dementia will wander, which can result in a difficult experience for both missing people and care givers. The demand for protecting and recovering missing people with dementia has been increased over the past decades. Advancement of this tracking system has the potential for enhancing their safety and giving a peace of mind to care givers without compromising the effectiveness. The core set of methods and processes of the technology has the potential to be replicated, adapted and used in other crowd sensing applications globally.  Even before the care givers notice, the "crowd" can potentially be able to help.

    This I-Corps project is focused on technology to improve the tracking, and protecting paradigm of using mobile devices carried by the people with dementia as well as will also explore the commercial potential of an intelligent tracking system. This innovative system, LED-based Smart Cue (LESQ), can monitor the status of the wearer in addition to tracking the location. If an abnormal condition is detected, the LESQ system can ask for immediate help. If the wearer carries a smartphone, the LESQ system can send an alert message directly to the care giver. One important feature of the LESQ system is to improve the self-diagnosis of the potential for wandering by the people with dementia. A smart tag tracks the wearer's status by using the timer and gaits, in addition to the geo-location. Implementation of the cost and power efficient, lightweight, and flexible system may significantly improve the usability.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to provide a digital health solution that empowers both patients and providers to engage in meaningful and personalized treatment. The market that this proposal has the ability to reach is significant and includes a medical/clinical segment, a research segment, and a performance segment. This approach has the potential to improve patient care while reducing healthcare costs. Additionally, as education of patients and the public improves regarding mental health, the negative stigma surrounding these conditions will decrease and more people in need will seek care.  An initial application will be in treating Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, where there is an urgent and critical need for innovation. Engaging patients in their treatment plans will have a positive impact on the lives of those suffering from mental illnesses.

    This I-Corps project is an innovative approach that provides easy to interpret results tailored to mental health providers, patients, and other non-technical users. The software aggregates data from numerous modalities, allowing for more complex and valuable analyses than existing platforms. The physiological data being collected has been scientifically proven to be related to mental well-being. Furthermore, clinicians are able to gain deeper insights into their patient's physiological response in real-time and over the course of a long-term treatment plan to guide clinical decision making. Existing barriers to treatment are addressed by providing seamless connection to various wearable devices, HIPAA-compliant architecture to ensure data privacy, pairing to audio recording or virtual reality environments, real-time note taking abilities, and simultaneous multi-session overlay. Engaging patients in their treatment plans through an objective measurement tool addresses a clear gap in mental health treatment, which is currently heavily reliant on subjective questionnaires and self-reporting.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is that it offer to standardize vaccines across a broad range of pathogens in an economical way.  Typically, depending on the type of pathogen, different vaccine development and manufacturing processes must be employed, resulting in costly technological fragmentation.  Having a single technology that is applicable to all pathogens is ideal, as it economically streamlines the development and manufacturing process.  The ability to rapidly produce vaccines on-demand and at scale is also important.  Conventional vaccine design and manufacturing methods take years to develop and months to produce using cells or eggs.  Vaccines that can instead be produced by chemically-defined organic and enzymatic reactions in the absence of any living systems is preferred as it avoids cross-contamination. Moreover, if the components can self-assemble into vaccines upon mixing, the energy requirements and costs are dramatically reduced.  With such a technology, new vaccines can be efficiently manufactured quickly to meet patient demand.

    This I-Corps project further develops a platform for a replicon payload inside the nanoparticle vaccine.  The replicon, a large mRNA, possesses the safety and flexibility of conventional mRNA, but is capable of finite self-replication. Antigens specific to a particular disease are encoded into the mRNA replicon.  Thus, once injected, the replicon can temporarily turn a patient's cells into a vaccine production factory.  A second merit is the delivery system innovation that enables the therapeutic deployment of replicons as a vaccination tool: the dendrimer nanomaterial.  Purpose-built for replicons, it is a fully synthetic, chemically-defined system that solves the decades-long challenge of safely delivering replicons intact into the cytoplasm of a patient's cells upon injection.  The vaccine nanoparticle efficiently activates the cellular and humoral branches of adaptive immunity without booster injections.  A third merit is the ability to perform simultaneous vaccinations.  Because of the delivery system's large payload capacity, a variety of different and unique replicons can be co-formulated to immunize patients against multiple diseases at once.  A fourth merit is that these vaccines do not require adjuvants, thus improving both tolerability and safety.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to enable a new portable power source with unprecedented energy density, which could have transformative effects on military and commercial portable/autonomous systems. For example, a portable power generator for soldiers using the proposed technology would result in a 50-75% weight reduction on a 72-hour mission, meaning soldiers could bring more water and ammo or reduce chance of injury due to weight. The proposed technology could also extend the operation of drones and other unmanned vehicles on land, air, and water. Currently these applications are almost exclusively powered by batteries, despite hydrocarbon fuel being 60 times more energy dense. The proposed technology could also be used in a number of commercial applications from emergency response and disaster relief, remote sensing, and energy access in emerging markets.

    This I-Corps project is a new approach to thermophotovoltaics, using a photonic crystal selective emitter, that enables practical fuel to electricity conversion in the 1-100 W range.  The technology works by converting fuel to electricity using heat and light as intermediaries. Specifically, hydrocarbon combustion heats a photonic crystal emitter to incandescence, leading to thermal radiation which drives specialized photovoltaic cells to generate electricity. Currently, there is no effective power source for applications requiring 1-100 Watts of electricity for extended duration, a space where demand is burgeoning. This technology would enable ultraportable, reliable, and silent energy generation, particularly for applications that do not have access to conventional power sources.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to develop algorithmic methods and computational systems that will provide new information, cheaply, quickly, consistently, and at a large scale, to inform investments in building, energy, and green infrastructure for engineering consultancies, construction companies, power utilities, real-estate developers, and cities. Currently, studies for built, energy, and green infrastructure investments are typically made case-by-case and employ infrequent, manual, and expensive audits performed by trained professionals. In addition, the ground-truth data (site surveys and other urban asset databases) used to inform these decisions are siloed across stakeholders and are often expensive and difficult to collect. The ecosystem of simulation and analysis tools is fragmented into a variety of highly complex software packages that require considerable effort and customization. This results in much repeated effort, inconsistent results across different projects, and high costs for surveys and instrumentation.

    This I-Corps project will investigate commercial applications of a machine learning system that ingests, aggregates, processes and learns mappings between, remote-sensing, model simulation, and local sensor and survey data on buildings and their environment. The data used will be best-available open source and commercial satellite data, as well as Internet of Things data from buildings and energy infrastructure. The project further develops neural-network based generative machine learning models that can emulate complex physical and engineering systems but are much cheaper and faster to deploy and maintain in practice. This system would allow users to make inferences (physical parameter recovery, forecasts) about built, green, and energy infrastructure and their surroundings (micro-climates) where this data is not available, in a low-cost, large-scale, automated way, removing the need for certain expensive sensor deployments or manual surveys. The system develops a top-down, machine-learning based simulation capability that would allow to perform fast scenario and impact analysis of investments and interventions.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will be a reduction in food losses and waste.  Roughly one third of the food produced in the world gets lost or wasted.  A large portion of this waste is due to proper cold-chain infrastructure from farms to consumers.  Transport refrigeration is an expensive option that consumes large amounts of diesel fuel.  The transport industry can see significant cost savings by converting to energy-efficient refrigeration units that utilize waste heat rather than using dedicated diesel engines.  This could make refrigeration more accessible to farmers, retailers and food processors everywhere.  The project is has the potential significantly reduce food waste worldwide.

     This I-Corps project will explore the commercialization potential of a new material that can absorb up to 82% water by weight, nearly twice the amount of the previous best material.  This highly absorbent material also demonstrates a record cooling capacity per given volume.  These capabilities open up a new class of applications in transport refrigeration where equipment weight and size need to be minimized.  An adsorption refrigeration cycle operating with this material can efficiently harvest waste heat from a truck's engine to produce two times the cooling power of a conventional vapor compressor system without using additional diesel fuel.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the applications of a technology, the Level Set Discrete Element Method (LS-DEM), to solve real-world problems.  Specifically, the project will look at the commercial viability of the technology in geotechnical engineering, civil engineering, food storage, additive manufacturing processes, pharmaceutical production lines, and mining and excavation industries among many others.  LS-DEM has capabilities that exceed current techniques within engineering practice, enabling more accurate analysis of engineering designs, enhancing optimization of existing engineering processes, and reducing engineering costs both in terms of time and money. Additionally, the potential exists for large improvements in the safety of both existing and new infrastructure from the increased understanding of physical processes that this technology can provide. Overall, the proposed technology has the potential to be a transformative technology that positively impacts many commercial industries.

    This I-Corps project investigates potential commercial applications and markets for the Level Set Discrete Element Method (LS-DEM) technology.  The intellectual merit of this method is to allow the rapid simulation and modeling of discrete objects with any shape, overcoming a major challenge within the field. Modeling of discrete objects is important in many commercial applications and shape is pivotal for correctly understanding systems.  For example, spherical objects behave very differently than rectangular objects, yet current discrete methods are mostly limited to spherical approximations in large granular systems. This results in less accurate and less informative results that LS-DEM overcomes by effectively and exactly replicating any component's shape.  LS-DEM has proven through past research to be highly accurate and predictive engineering tool. This work will investigate various commercial applications, where a better understanding of discrete object interactions can impact our engineering and scientific understanding of the system or systems in question.

    The broader/commercial impact of this I-Corps project is to potentially reduce significantly the number of deaths of premature babies in low to middle income countries. Premature birth is globally the number one cause of death in children under the age of 5, with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) being the leading cause of these deaths. RDS is usually addressed by using a bCPAP (bubble continuous positive airway pressure) machine that provides the baby with a humidified blend of air and oxygen at a controlled temperature and pressure. The goal of this project is to develop a state-of-the-art, low-cost bCPAP machine that aids preterm babies in low to middle income countries. While bCPAP devices are standard in wealthy nations, their $8-10k cost often makes them unaffordable for countries with fewer resources.

    This I-Corps project will explore the commercial potential of a novel bubble continuous positive airway pressure (bCPAP) machine.  Some of the innovative features of this device include a cassette format for ease of maintenance and repair, a battery backup for uninterrupted care, robust component selection for extended lifetime use and a drug delivery add on for potential treatment of comorbidities. If successfully implemented, this product would potentially help provide quality affordable healthcare to underserved populations and reduce premature deaths due to respiratory distress syndrome.

    The broader impact / commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to better identify the commercial opportunity for three-dimensional nanostructured materials made via high-throughput holographic methods. These materials have a truss-like structure at submicron length scales, giving them better properties like improved strength-to-weight ratio. An analogy would be how we use trusses for bridges instead of solid hunks of steel. This manufacturing method will enable industrial-scale manufacturing of materials useful in multiple US industries. For example, membrane separations are used, for example, in biomedical testing, drug and therapeutic production, scientific research, and water treatment. Optical devices such as cameras, microscopes, and lighting could also be improved by various types of these three-dimensional nanostructured materials.

    This I-Corps project will identify the particular advantages of CHISEL (coordinated holographic industrial-scale electromagnetic lithography), which has the potential to greatly reduce the cost of three-dimensional nanostructured materials. Conventional photolithography for making integrated circuits is high quality, but slow and costly. Techniques such as imprint lithography are faster and cheaper, but limited to making essentially two-dimensional structures. CHISEL will enable continuous nanoscale manufacturing with high throughput. The method controls the phase of several interfering optical beams to continuously pattern a photosensitive material. A first-generation CHISEL tool (i.e. alpha tool) can have a volume patterning rate several orders of magnitude greater than conventional projection lithography (and with comparable or less capital cost).

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to alleviate the pain and suffering to patients and the cost to the healthcare system caused by pressure ulcers, or more commonly known as bedsores. Costs associated with treating pressure ulcers have increased significantly in recent decades. Individuals with a pressure ulcer are also at an increased risk of developing an infection at the site of the wound. Notably, hospital-acquired advanced ulcers are reportable to healthcare agencies and thus non-reimbursable, leaving clinical entities absorbing all treatment and legal costs, in addition to a decrease of their healthcare quality ratings.

    This I-Corps project will evaluate the commercial viability of a disposable, adhesive sensor that provides nurses with actionable data about the status of their patients' skin, thus eliminating the need for constant visual inspection. The device uses optical sensing technology to monitor structural and functional changes that occur both superficially and under a patient's skin to detect the earliest signs of a pressure ulcer before they become visible to the human eye. In addition to exploring marketability, this project will collect valuable information that will guide potential product development in preparation to clinical validation.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps will be to enable faster development of protein-based therapeutic drugs, such as antibodies and biosimilars. The core technology allows for faster determination of structural features of such protein therapeutic agents, which is important because structure is essential to both the function and efficiency of a protein therapeutic. The technology can be applied at many points within a therapeutic's development, from the initial discovery and screening phases to testing a developed therapeutic's stability under a wide array of conditions and environments for quality control purposes. Given the significant fraction of protein therapeutics, specifically, within the rapidly growing biopharmaceutical market, we believe our technology will both be of significant value to this industry and enable faster development of therapeutics for treating diseases in the future.

    This I-Corps project further develops a technology that determines structural features of proteins in a liquid environment.  This is significant not only because a protein's structure dictates its function and by learning about the structure much information is gained about the protein itself, but also because proteins natively exist within cells in liquid environments. A plasma is used to create a reactive molecule from water surrounding the protein, and by measuring the areas on the protein that get labeled with this molecule, one can visualize relevant regions of the protein. When another element is added that changes the structure of the protein, or binds to and masks one side/face of the protein, this is reflected is changing levels or areas of modification by the reactive molecule. In this way, the technique can quickly map protein structural changes.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to fill a critical need in neuro-radiology, neuro-oncology, and radiation therapy, by developing a clinic-ready software suite that computes physician-approved volumes of key three-dimensional (3D) structures in the brain from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Currently, physicians make a decision on tumor status by visual inspection and by measuring the largest perpendicular diameters from a single two-dimensional (2D) axial image. Radiation oncologists use manual segmentation to delineate the boundaries of the tumor regions; these contours are used for treatment planning. Current practice is associated with significant limitations that impede the quality of patient care. This software suite will potentially change the status-quo by generating 3D volumetric structures of tumors and other key regions in the brain. The physician can readily apply this information to better understand the disease and optimize care leading to early treatment, less morbidity, and longer survival times.

    This I-Corps project produces a practical, clinic-ready suite of Magnetic Resonance (MR) analyses and display tools to solve the number one impediment to reliable use of MRIs for guiding radiation treatment of brain cancer: accurate and timely multimodal 3D segmentation of key structures in the brain. The main engine of the MR suite is a mathematical optimization framework that combines calculus of variation with deep learning techniques; thus amenable to pixel-level-accurate 3D segmentation in almost real-time. The proposed technology was developed from an algorithm for multimodal brain segmentation, which consists of (a) an automated, accurate and robust algorithm for 3D image segmentation, combined with (b) semi-automated and interactive multimodal labeling that requires physician approval.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to propel the development of single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) into a mainstream structural biology technique.  The core technology is a research tool that provides a reliable, reproducible, cost-effective method for scientists to prepare their protein samples in the biomedical field.  By studying proteins in their natural environment using cryo-EM, researchers get a better understanding of their structures and thus their functions within the cells.  This new knowledge will potentially facilitate as well as accelerate the development of therapeutic treatments.

    This I-Corps project explores the commercial potential of a stand-alone cryo-EM sample preparation stage.  The core technology in discussion is based on the application of state-of-the-art microfluidic systems to deposit and vitrify protein solution on EM grids in milliseconds.  Furthermore, it offers scientists the ability to control their sample thickness by adjusting the thickness of the protein solution before it hits the grid.  With this technology, a larger region of the cryo-EM grids will have intact protein molecules and the right thickness of vitrified aqueous layer and is thus usable for structural determination, allowing researchers to save significant time and money in terms of image collection as well as tedious protein extraction and purification.  This way more protein structures can be solved, and thus better therapeutics and drugs can be developed.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is more efficient heat transfer in a variety of potential industrial and consumer electronics applications.  More efficient heat transfer translates into greater computational speed and output.  In a world where electronics are growing more powerful and are ever increasing in capacity, the ability to remove heat is a significant consideration.  This platform technology has the potential to be integrated as a high performance thermal grease. One possible application is as a computer CPU grease (or heat paste, heat sink compound, heat sink paste, thermal compound, thermal gel, thermal interface material, or thermal paste).  Similar products are commonly used as an interface between heat sinks and heat sources.

    This I-Corps project further develops a class of novel greases that incorporate nanoparticles to enhance their performance. Thesee are stable and homogeneous greases based on carbon nanotubes in polyalphaolefin oil.  Inter molecular Van der Waals forces and three dimensional percolation networks in the grease structure are determined to be the stability of the grease. The work builds on a recent discovery of a way to significantly enhance the electrical and thermal conductivity of the grease by including these additional additives in small amounts.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project are twofold. This technology is characterized by its connection to flexible and hybrid electronics (FHE) technologies and the Internet of Things (IoT), and by its remarkably large potential application space. As an approach that was specifically designed with FHE technologies in mind, this invention has the potential to radically transform the IoT landscape. Indeed, such a combination of capabilities in a thin-film printed form factor could give birth to a new class of ubiquitous IoT devices. The social, economic, and environmental benefits of such devices becoming mainstream and low cost could be significant. This would enable the collection of tracking and sensing data across a large variety of application areas, such as reducing the losses of perishables during transportation of agricultural products, permitting the monitoring of temperature-sensitive health products, and minimizing the risks related to pipeline leaks and aging infrastructure.

    This I-Corps project builds on technology that was developed asa low cost Internet of Things (IoT) solution for the ubiquitous and rapid detection of hazardous chemical agents in large industrial and public environments.  It was demonstrated for the real-time indoor-light-powered and battery-less detection of ammonia by a low-cost inkjet-printed wireless tag. It consists in the combination of novel communications approaches and radio-frequency hardware which can enable low cost, printed and flexible "Smart-Skin" devices which can communicate and be localized at a maximum range in excess of 1000 yards, while only requiring an operating power on the order of that of a wrist watch.  The approach lies at the interface of various current areas of technological progress, such as 5G and IoT networks, flexible and hybrid printed electronics, automotive radars, and nanomaterials-based sensing.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project derives from its potential applications that enable a better understanding of, and treatments for, brain disorders.  Last year, over 50 million U.S. adults were afflicted by a central nervous system disease such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, depression, and autism. Particularly as the population ages, neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease are rapidly increasing. This project further develops an innovative technology that, for the first time, enables scalable, cost-effective, GMP-compliant generation of human brain organoids.  The technology will facilitate the development of applications for human brain organoids both for basic research, including drug discovery and disease-in-the-dish modeling of neurological disorders, and clinical applications, where the human brain organoids may be developed as a source of therapeutic cells for transplantation.  This technological advance, furthermore, promotes the advancement of personalized medicine approaches to both therapeutic development and brain cell transplantation.

    This I-Corps project is focused on the production of human brain organoids as an enabling technology for advancements in basic science discovery, neuropharmaceutical discovery, and therapeutic cell production for a wide variety of human brain disorders.  The project further develops an improved method for the generation of human brain organoids from induced pluripotent stem cells. The technology has several advantages over previously described methods including improved simplicity and efficiency of organoid production, documented consistency of the product, production method using only a chemically defined hydrogel matrix and cell culture medium, and improved scalability of manufacturing.  Taken together these features enable, for the first time, a commercially viable means of brain organoid production.  The method is also amenable to cGMP-compliant manufacturing which enables the development of therapeutic cell products from the organoids.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to accelerate and control gene delivery, and to allow researchers to find novel solutions to challenging diseases.  Gene delivery, also known as transfection, is a promising approach to treat diseases such as cancer and, thus, could provide a profound benefit to society.  Using gene therapy and immune-therapy, gene delivery allows for the efficient introduction of a new gene into cells. The specific technology employed offers a photo-responsive, nanoparticle-based technique with the advantages of higher efficacy, controlled gene-release, and faster transfection rates.  This has the potential to dramatically decrease the time required for transfection, as well as greatly reducing the required amount of gene and/or drug.  Thus, along with providing researchers the unique ability to control the process through a simple light trigger, this technology could provide substantial commercial impact.

    This I-Corps project is a gene delivery tool that utilizes two biocompatible surfactants which associate spontaneously into light-sensitive nanoparticles when dissolved in water.  Nucleic acids (DNA/siRNA) can be loaded inside of the nanoparticles to protect the nucleic acids until they reach the interior of cells.  Similarly, hydrophobic/hydrophilic drug molecules can also be carried within the nanoparticles.  Subsequent exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light leads to nanoparticle dissociation, resulting in the triggered release of nucleic acids, which can then modify the DNA of the cell or stop disease-associated protein production.  Researchers would be able to utilize this gene delivery technology in two different ways: (1) substitution of new genes to the cell, or (2) inactivation of existing genes.  The combination of lower costs (of both the carrier components and the nucleic acids due to higher efficiencies) and faster delivery/transfection rates with our technology compared to current gene-delivery technologies could have a considerable impact throughout the industry.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to enable wider adoption of  vaginal microbiome testing solutions. The most common vaginal dysbiosis is bacterial vaginosis (BV) which affects 30% of women at any given time. Having BV puts women at risk for increased incidence of sexually transmitted infections, urinary tract infections, and, if pregnant, preterm birth, low birth weight, and spontaneous abortion. Yet, most women don't even know they have BV.  BV is only treated if it is symptomatic, but half of all cases are asymptomatic. Therefore, there are millions of women with BV, who are at risk for infections and adverse pregnancy outcomes, but are unaware of their risk. This technology would allow for discrete at-home testing that includes an easy to understand report that can be shared directly with the patient's physician.

    This I-Corps project will explore the commercial potential of an at-home sampling kits for analyzing the vaginal microbiome (bacteria).  The vision is to empower women with new knowledge about their health, and drive innovative care around female related bacterial disorders. The core of our technology is twofold - DNA sequencing and bioinformatics. For DNA sequencing, our technology uses Illumina sequencers to analyze a vaginal bacterial sample to attain part of the bacterial genomes. A proprietary bioinformatics pipeline is then used to categorize and quantify the bacteria present in the sample. Classifying the bacteria then allows the user to better understand how they can get and stay healthy.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to revolutionize the healthcare industry by providing a fast, low-cost, and easy-to-use DNA sequencer to healthcare providers for clinical use. DNA stores the genetic information of all living organisms and the successful development and commercialization of a fast and low cost DNA sequencing technique will be important not only to the advancement of fundamental medical research in biomarker discovery and oncology studies, but also to the future development of personalized medicine which relies on treating individual patients based on their unique genomic composition. The commercial sequencing methods such as SMRT and NGS require either a high sequencing charge or a large capital investment. The nanofluidic based DNA sequencer is a ?direct' sequencing technique that can be significantly more cost effective than the existing commercial methods.

    This I-Corps project opens up a new path for DNA sequencing. The core technology of the nanofluidic based DNA sequencer is a nanochannel chip with embedded nanoelectrodes capable of determining the sequence a single-stranded DNA by measuring the unique electron tunneling properties of individual nucleotides. Manufacturing of the nanofluidic system involves a sequential application of MEMS processing, atomic force microscopy, and focused ion beam. The nanofluidic system belongs to a group of novel chip-based DNA sequencing techniques which utilize disposable chips to directly measure the DNA sequence. Unlike the commercial methods which rely mostly on biochemical processing, the chip-based methods do not require time-consuming sample pre-processing steps such as PCR nor expensive facilities for parallel processing. The nanofluidic system measures the electron tunneling current of a single DNA strand as it is dragged across a set of nanoelectrodes. Since the molecular structures of the nucleotides in the DNA strand are different, their tunneling currents are also different. The nanofluidic system determines the DNA sequence by analyzing the variation of the tunneling current along the DNA strand.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to produce lightweight aggregates (LWA) from unused waste bottom ash of coal electric power industry that can be used for concrete and geotechnical applications. Each year in the United States around 120 million tons of coal combustion products (e.g., fly ash and bottom ash) are generated of which 37% is reused. This has led to a large historical stock of unused coal ash stored in on-site surface impoundments.  Production of LWA from unused bottom ash will result in conversion of waste material to value-added product that can attract concrete and geotechnical markets. The produced LWA can be used as an aggregate in (a) structural lightweight concrete production, (b) internal curing of concrete, (c) production of concrete masonry blocks for buildings, retaining walls and landscape, (d) production of thermal/sound insulating concrete units, and (e) lightweight fill for highways, bridge abutments, retaining walls, and foundations.

    This I-Corps project will lead to significant understanding of market size and commercial potential of lightweight aggregates (LWA) produced from waste bottom ash. Bottom ash has high residual carbon and the innovative sintering technology is to use this residual carbon with appropriate fluxing agent to create a porous material encapsulated by a glassy layer that exhibits pozzolanic reactivity. This novel material will possess an active amorphous surface and an inert crystalline porous interior in a controlled ratio. The technology uses a thermodynamic model and can target a wide range of bottom coal ashes with various physical conditions and chemical compositions.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to explore the commercialization potential of an integrated converter. The proposed integration not only reduces the weight, volume and cost of onboard power electronic interfaces, but also enhances their efficiencies, and enables bidirectional operation. The team aims at not only fostering the widespread adoption of electric vehicles through improving performance of onboard power electronics, but also looking for other industries that could benefit from this technology. The project has the potential to significantly reduce the cost of electrified transportation systems while enhancing their performance. This work will lead to exploring the commercialization potential of the first integrated onboard charger/converter for plug-in electric vehicles.

    This I-Corps project is aimed at exploring market development and commercialization opportunity of an integrated onboard charger and auxiliary load DC/DC converter for electric vehicles. The proposed technology utilizes silicon carbide (SiC) semiconductors to take full advantage of wide band gap (WBG) SiC switches, to increase the operation switching frequency, reduce the size of passive components, and reduce cooling requirements, without sacrificing the operation efficiency of the converter. This technology also uses a maximum efficiency tracking strategy to enhance the efficiency of the charger not only at full loads but also particularly at medium and light loads. A proof-of-concept prototype of the proposed technology has been designed, developed and shown to have significant improvement in maximum efficiency in small form factors.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to advance microbiologists' ability to detect, characterize, and control microscopic organisms such as bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Collectively, the planet's microbiome makes up more than 80% of all living mass and it significantly impacts human health and activities. Some microorganisms are beneficial, providing useful industrial functions or therapeutic value; others can cause severe disease and disrupt industrial processes. Currently, microbiologists grow microorganisms in their laboratories to characterize molecular and cellular mechanisms related to replication, pathogenicity, therapeutic and industrial properties, and interactions with the host and the environment. These goals have proven successful in the generation of diagnostic tools, new therapies, and improving industrial processes. However, a vast proportion of microorganisms remain unable to be efficiently cultivated. Particularly in clinical diagnostics, the ability to detect pathogens accurately and in a timely manner has a direct impact in patient health. This project seeks to address this bottleneck by accelerating the time to detect and isolate microbes from clinical and industrial samples. It is anticipated that reducing the time required to analyze samples from days to a few hours will lead to significant improvements in clinical outcomes and industrial microbiology.

    This I-Corps project focuses on developing a miniaturized and disposable device that automatically performs sample processing and analysis to isolate and characterize bacteria. It features state-of-the-art microelectronic arrays embedded in microfluidic channels. The array generates electrical force fields having specific frequencies to selectively isolate microorganisms from background debris and other undesired cells present in clinical and industrial samples. Laboratory prototypes have demonstrated proof-of-principle for the isolation and detection subsystems. In the next phase of the technical development, these components will be integrated into a single device. This project will inform the specific design criteria and requirements for this next prototype through customer discovery work.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the use of embedded machine listening as a low-cost, turnkey solution for early detection of machinery malfunction and improve predictive maintenance. In manufacturing, sound-based condition monitoring coupled with data-driven maintenance can help significantly reduce unscheduled work stoppages, faulty products and waste of raw materials. Building management systems can be augmented by integrating real-time condition updates for critical machinery such as HVAC units, elevators, boilers and pumps, minimizing disruption for managers and users of those services. This technology is flexible, accurate and data-driven, potentially providing a low barrier to adoption for prospective customers and adaptability to various markets. Beyond predictive maintenance, applications include noise level monitoring for ensuring compliance in workplaces and airports, home and building security, early alert for traffic accidents, bio-acoustic monitoring of animal species, and outdoor noise monitoring at scale for improved enforcement in smart cities.

    This I-Corps project further develops research at the intersection of artificial intelligence and the internet of things. The technology consists of a calibrated and highly accurate acoustic sensor with embedded sound recognition AI based on deep learning.  Sound conveys critical information about the environment that often cannot be measured by other means. In manufacturing, early stage machinery malfunction can be indicated by abnormal acoustic emissions. In smart homes and buildings, sound can be monitored for signs of alarm, distress or compliance.  Sound sensing is omnidirectional and robust to occlusion and contextual variables such as lightning conditions at different times of the day. Many existing solutions cannot identify different types of sounds or complex acoustic patterns, making them unsuited for these applications. This solution is both low cost and capable of identifying events and sources at the network edge, thus eliminating the need for sensitive audio information to be transmitted.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of an instrument-free colorimetric point-of-care diagnostic capable of detecting antibiotic resistance in patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) at time of care. Currently, there are no diagnostic options that can provide doctors with resistance information at time of care. Traditional microbiology techniques take three days to deliver results, so doctors must prescribe antibiotic treatments empirically. By rapidly detecting antibiotic resistance, the correct class of antibiotic can be prescribed at time of care. In the short-term, this enables better patient care where the patient can receive the lowest generation and narrowest spectrum antibiotic that is appropriate, meaning fewer potential side effects. Further, for those patients who exhibit higher-order resistance, last-resort antibiotics can be employed to ensure that the infection is cleared during the first course of antibiotics.

    This I-Corps project is based on patented core technology that enables rapid detection of b-lactam resistant bacteria in urine samples without the need of sample processing or bacterial culturing steps that are currently required in the clinical workflow. This biochemical assay directly detects the enzyme responsible for resistance by using a unique amplification strategy. The amplification technology is based on an innovative enzyme-dependent amplification cascade that is paired to traditional molecular diagnostic probes to create an increase in signal, allowing for detection of low abundant biomarkers without the need of sophisticated instrumentation. Ultimately, a color change indicates the presence of bacteria resistant to b-lactam antibiotics. This technology reduces time-to-results to just 30 minutes, compared to 3 days with traditional microbiology analysis.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to improve security by providing the strongest levels of network destination control with minimum deployment requirements. This project addresses the problem of Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks on the Internet, which have been used in recent years to silence a variety of organizations, including companies, governments, and non-profits. The proposed mechanism defends against such DDoS attacks, and can improve Internet availability for a variety of customers. Bringing a DDoS-prevention mechanism to market prevents attackers from silencing and denying service to their targets, enabling increased availability to deployments of such systems.

    This I-Corps project explores the commercial potential for a cloud-based traffic filtering technology.  The technology combines two significant, but distinct, approaches to Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) prevention - commercial approaches that perform in-cloud filtering to remove the most obvious DDoS traffic, and academic approaches that perform in-network filtering based on protocol-specific fairness criteria. The technology explored combines the in-cloud filtering of existing commercial approaches, together with a mechanism called "capabilities" in the academic approaches, to create an in-cloud, destination-driven enforcement of per-flow bandwidth allocations. This destination-driven approach can enforce a wide variety of destination-specified policies with a single mechanism, and each destination can choose the traffic that it wishes to prioritize. As a result, the same mechanism can to be used to defend against DDoS attacks and to provide priority to certain traffic.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project includes the enabling of wide scale exploitation of the growing volume of airborne image data from unmanned aerial systems (UAS) to monitor the environment in near real-time. Persistent and tactical surveillance of infrastructure assets (e.g., critical infrastructure, roads, pipelines), military bases, agricultural fields, boarders, or other extensive assets requiring routine monitoring for tactical decision making is becoming cost feasible with the introduction of UAS, but the volume of data collected cannot be exploited using traditional, largely manual, methods. Automated processing and interpretation of large volumes of airborne imagery in near real-time will enable improved decision making and, subsequent, cost reductions and improved performance for a range of industries and agencies. The operations of infrastructure management, disaster response, security, intelligence, and agriculture are amongst the expected beneficiaries.

    This I-Corps project explores the commercialization potential of a platform from near real-time analysis and exploitation of airborne image data. Research exploring the development of an airborne system for monitoring critical infrastructure during the response phase on natural disasters resulted in the development of an analytical model for repeat station imaging and refinement of a conceptual model for the design of time-sensitive remote sensing systems that collectively permit the design and implementation of automated change detection and monitoring systems from airborne imaging. This spatial analytics platform automates 3D scene reconstruction, and uses artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to convert digital photos into a cataloged and indexed spatial intelligence database of changes over time.  3D/4D object classifiers are developed to extract complex features that 2D imagery is unable to represent. This method trains neural networks on volumetric data and multi-temporal spatial data to facilitate the extraction and identification of features and how they have changed. Object identification and characterization will provide the capability to semantically describe changes 3D and 4D space.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to improve long distance data transmission. The global consumer internet traffic experiences annual growth requiring continuous improvement in internet backbone efficiency.  A wide range of industries are impacted by such improvements. Some applications, such as smart cities, require considerable improvements in infrastructure network efficiency. For example, in order to accomplish smart cities with the heterogeneous applications on Internet of Things (IoT), improving infrastructure network efficiency is necessary. Furthermore, the fifth generation (5G) wireless network as the next generation mobile system is also reliant on a resilient high speed telecommunication backbone network.  On a broad scale, these improvements to networks will increase efficiency of data centers and computing platforms and can improve the energy efficiency of such systems.  Dynamic multi-layer network optimization will make networks adaptable to traffic variation and potential failure events, and consequently eliminate the costly and wasteful over provisioning of system resources.

    This I-Corps project explores the commercialization path for telecommunication networks optimization technology. This method monitors traffic requirements from higher layers and performs multi-layer optimization on the optical and internet protocol layers. It achieves improvements in data transmission speed and network resource usage while guaranteeing network stability. These techniques do not require prior knowledge of the network equipment specifications, are scalable, provide high accuracy and are able to adjust and learn changes on the network. The implementation feasibility has been successfully demonstrated in small-scale prototypes and the performance improvements at scale has been extensively studies by numerical evaluations proving up to 2x improvement in transmission speed and 10 percent reduction in equipment usage.

    The broader impact / commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to improve the information available to workforce planners in a way that reduces the time and money they spend in assessing and anticipating regional workforce needs. With the help of more accurate analytics, workforce planners will be able to shift more of their resources towards designing and developing training initiatives that fill the most likely skills-gaps for workers in the near- to mid-term, thus keeping their regions globally competitive in rapidly-evolving labor markets. The commercial potential of this project derives from advances in computational techniques to identify industry-specific skills gaps empirically; to map the related structure of regional production; and to uncover new skills-induced career pathways in regional economies using those maps. Bringing these technical advances to workforce analysts and policy makers will provide both with the best available tools to respond adaptively to the innovative needs of their economies.

    This I-Corps project uses advanced analytics and Big Data collection methods to assess the technical and spatial distribution of work in cities with the goal of providing insights along three dimensions: patterns of technology diffusion and their workforce implications; human capital-based evolutionary competitive advantages of regional economies; and the structure of regional "economic ecosystems" as a source of entrepreneurship and innovation. The algorithms search the parameter space of regional economic activities, capabilities, and technologies to describe the actual structure of work within a given region. In effect, this innovation enables the automation of key aspects of workforce planning strategy that are typically time-consuming and expensive because they typically rely on surveys. The approach developed here will enhance the speed and accuracy of labor market analysis.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project includes the commercial availability of affordable monodisperse short  and long polyethylene glycols (PEGs). Areas that will benefit from their commercialization include organic synthesis, bioconjugation, nanotechnology, pharmaceutical chemistry and more. Currently, monodisperse short PEGs can be prohibitively expensive. Many scientists have to devote significant time to synthesize them or have to use less ideal alternative materials. More seriously, there is no technology to synthesize monodisperse long PEGs and scientists in the pharmaceutical industry often use impure PEGs for drug PEGylation (i.e. tagging with PEG).  Commercialization of affordable monodisperse PEGs and their derivatives may transform the ways researchers and manufacturers conduct their projects.

    This I-Corps project explores the market potential of novel technologies that can be used to synthesize polyethylene glycols (PEG) and derivatives in monodisperse form and with much lower costs. Short PEGs are widely used as linkers in areas including organic synthesis, and pharmaceutical chemistry. Long PEGs are used for PEGylating pharmaceuticals to increase water solubility and bio-stability, and to reduce undesirable immune responses and dosing frequency. Currently monodisperse short PEGs can be synthesized via stepwise organic synthesis. However, the process requires chromatography to purify intermediates and product, which consumes large volumes of solvents and silica gel. The waste to product ratio can be over 1000 to 1. For long PEGs, they are made by random polymerization, and there is no technology to make them monodisperse. Therefore, impure PEGs are often used for drug PEGylation. To overcome the challenges in monodisperse PEG production, novel technologies based on solid phase stepwise synthesis will be developed.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is in its ability to improve the road transportation safety. According to Federal Highway Administration, approximately 22% of crashes are weather-related and 73% of those are related to wet pavement.  The need to monitor tire health, wear and hydroplaning potential and the road surface condition has been continuously addressed by tire and automotive industry over the past two decades. Advancement of this intelligent tire system has the potential for enhancing the safety and reliability of the transportation system by directly predicting these parameters and providing more accurate information to the on-board advanced chassis control systems. This technology has the potential to be installed on all tires of all vehicles on the roads globally.

    This I-Corps project will explore the commercial potential of an intelligent tire system. This innovative system can, in real-time, predict tire pressure and monitor tire health, wear, hydroplaning potential, and provide the road surface friction potential. Implementation of efficient intelligent tire systems will greatly increase knowledge of the road surface friction potential, thereby reducing the number of accidents by allowing the automobile control system to react to varying road conditions. One important feature of the intelligent tire system is to greatly improve the prediction of tire-road contact friction potential.  Because intelligent tires can be part of the active chassis control system, this system can potentially be easily integrated with existing vehicle technologies as well as future intelligent transportation systems.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is through the provision of high-performing lower-cost industrial and commercial buildings. By delivering a practical, efficient, and site-friendly system of masonry construction, the single face shell wall system provides contractors, architects, and engineers a better way to achieve the strength and durability of building with non-combustible minerals without sacrificing the speed, flexibility, and ease of modern open-wall construction. The project will provide market insight contributing to the successful commercialization of single-face shell masonry walls. Market acceptance of this class of load-bearing building wall products would accrue substantial improvements to both the embodied and operating energy profile of low-rise construction, which constitutes the vast majority of commercial buildings. Inorganic masonry building systems better resist damage from both fire and water infiltration, the leading causes of commercial building insurance damage claims, thereby attaining longer building lifespans. Market adoption of improvements to the thermal envelope and construction cost of load-bearing wall masonry buildings will have correspondingly large impacts in the durability and resiliency of the US commercial construction industry.

    This I-Corps project investigates the market for load-bearing, single-layer, thermally insulated exterior building wall systems. The wall technology is an open system allowing a variety of insulation, plumbing, and wiring types to be used in the wall assembly, leveraging local trade efficiencies and meeting contemporary energy codes. As with open-wall stud construction, insulation, electrical, low-voltage, and plumbing rough-ins can all be scheduled, installed, and inspected independently of the construction of the wall, improving productivity for masons and reducing construction duration. The wall units can be manufactured by conventional block production facilities at a rate significantly greater than conventional hollow block while using a third less cement and aggregate. The proposed project will assess product-market fit and commercial viability for this type of wall assembly through interviews with general contractors, project managers, and preconstruction professionals.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to serve the "Convergence Insufficiency" clinical population, which includes millions of people in the US alone, as well as 50% of the brain injury population who has post concussive syndrome (PCS).  Designing engaging vision therapy protocols that leverage virtual reality gaming technology will have a dramatic impact in particular on this young population's academic and professional career growth and goals.  Broad market impacts also include the opportunity for translational research funded by prior NSF grants to reach the general public. This solution has the potential to be an affordable alternative to traditional vision therapy administered in the comfort of one's home saving both healthcare cost and patient's time.

    This I-Corps project seeks to explore the commercial potential of a novel combination of virtual reality and vision therapy technologies. Convergence Insufficiency is a binocular vision dysfunction which causes the following vision symptoms: blurry and double vision, eye stress and strain, headaches, and a 'halo' effect where words appear to float above the page while reading. These visual symptoms negatively impact a person's ability to perform near work such as reading and computer/tablet use. The Virtual Reality Vision Therapy developed here encompasses integration of eye tracking with traditional vision therapy methodologies, promotion of patient compliance through a suite of engaging virtual reality video game experiences, objective assessments of patient progress throughout the course of vision therapy, and a flexible platform to create a patient specific therapeutic intervention.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will be that a novel clinical schedule optimization technology developed based on a prior NSF funded research project can be used to reduce staffing costs in health systems. The technology will also help improve patient safety. Results from prior analysis suggest that significant joint operational and safety costs savings are possible using the system. Since staffing costs, specifically clinical workforce costs, constitute a significant portion of healthcare costs, a large impact on overall health care costs can result from successful implementation of the schedule optimization technology.  Additional safety benefits will offer potential further savings.

    This I-Corps project with help explore the processes used in making staffing and scheduling decisions for the clinical staff, and how the developed clinical schedule optimization technology can potentially be leveraged to improve these decisions in real operational settings. The findings from this exploration will help the investigator team to understand the market readiness for this technology, and the viability of potential products and services to help improve hospital systems. This will inform the technology's further development by determining the target market and understanding of current staffing products and solutions.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-corps project can affect many industries and applications where lightweight structures and materials are advantageous. Cellular materials, such as honeycombs, foams, and lattice materials, are some of the lightest, stiffest, and strongest available at moderate to low density. There is an ever present demand for lighter, stiffer and stronger materials in industries such as aerospace, automotive, defense, civil engineering, sports equipment. Lighter materials are demanded by users to experience enhanced performance, and they are sought by producers to gain a competitive edge. This project aims to find commercial applications for an ultra-lightweight cellular materials geometry-a type of 3D honeycomb-that achieves theoretical upper limits for structural efficiency and stiffness. This unique geometry is the first of its kind, and can facilitate structures with extreme stiffness, high strength, and maximum lightweight performance. The main focus is to identify opportunities in unmanned aerial vehicles for defense and commercial use.

    This I-Corps project assesses the commercial viability of a 3D honeycomb-like material geometry, and the Intellectual Merit encompasses establishing the commercial utility of the accompanying design, analysis and experimental scheme, which enables the creation of lightweight optimized structures with maximum stiffness and very high strength. This design is composed of two highly anisotropic subgeometries whose contributions can be tailored locally, through simple design parameters, to produce functionally graded and highly optimized structures. The symmetries and alignments of material are unique in 3D space. The relatively simple geometry can be fabricated through origami like sheet folding, allowing access to a multitude of material systems and very low density structures. This design was generated using a semi-automated finite element modeling algorithm, which allowed for a wide variety of designs to be considered.

    The broader impact and commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to provide a path for integrating photovoltaics into a wide range of new form factors. The project will first explore the commercial potential of integrating high-performance, light-weight flexible solar panels onto freight truck trailers, shading fabrics, and military tents. When the large exterior surfaces of a freight truck trailer are covered by high-efficiency solar panels the technology can significantly improve overall diesel fuel efficiencies.  Retrofitting flexible solar panels onto shading fabrics, such as canopies, awnings, and car parking ports can potentially allow for local, potentially off-grid, power sources. The flexible solar panels will also potentially help the military cope with their power needs for operations occur in remote locations.  All these applications rely on the new form factors the core technology in this project enables.

    This I-Corps project is based on core technology that overcomes major obstacles in perovskite solar cells, including their short lifetime, lengthy processing steps, and substantial efficiency drops from large-area fabrication on flexible substrates. Commonly used annealing approaches require prolonged heating at high temperatures to attain desired material properties. Therefore, they are not typically compatible with high-speed printing. The technology developed here accomplishes a rapid layer-specific photonic treatment for the target layer without damaging the underlying flexible substrate and perovskite materials. This innovative technology enables large-scale manufacturing of durable and fully-flexible perovskite solar cells through high-speed printing.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project involves the use of a non-sticking and anti-biofouling surface coating to address public health and hygiene concerns. Specifically, the slippery function of our coatings can be integrated into medical devices and sanitation facilities to passively prevent accumulation of contaminants such as bacteria, urine, and feces. Integrating this coating into medical devices could reduce hospital acquired infections and patient complications related to biofouling of medical devices.  The coating is non-sticky to various liquid and solid wastes, and therefore can potentially be used to minimize waste water generation in household, institutional, and industrial sanitation facilities.  This surface coating has the potential to also mitigate global water scarcity, reduce the transmission of infectious diseases associated with poor sanitation facilities, and reduce costs associated with flush toilet use and maintenance.

    This I-Corps project is based on a surface coating technology, referred to as the Liquid-Entrenched Smooth Surface (LESS). LESS is a sprayable, anti-bacteria fouling surface coating that can repel various liquids and solids. Results have shown that the LESS coating can be applied to various surfaces within minutes, and can significantly reduce adhesion of different solids up to ~90% compared to untreated control surfaces. Furthermore, the LESS coating has shown exceptional anti-bacteria fouling properties comparable to the state-of-the-art surfaces. The LESS technology is designed to reduce surface fouling of biological fluids and solid wastes with potential applications in anti-bacteria fouling medical devices and water-saving for sanitation facilities.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project brings several benefits in medical imaging.  These include a substantial improvement in diagnostic image quality and contrast, enhanced soft tissue image resolution, an image method free from ionizing radiation, and substantial reduction in patient discomfort.  This new medical imaging technology will potentially reduce clinical costs by decreasing the number of hospitalizations, surgeries and physician visits.  It is envisioned that the technology will potentially capture a significant part of the imaging contrast agent market and eventually be used to treat not only cancer-related diseases but also other diseases such as cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, neurological, and nephrological disorders.

    This I-Corps project aims to improve early cancer diagnosis by developing targeted contrast agents for use with a clinical scanner to improve diagnostic image quality. Small tumors cannot typically be detected using current scanning methods and cancers are often not diagnosed during this early stage when the disease can most susceptible to treatment. The engineered contrast agents we have developed are polymer-based nanoparticles whose external and internal chemistry and morphology can be tailored according to the patient's need.  The nanoparticles have a hollow core with an inner lining of a semiconducting polymer that emits a strong imaging signal when used with a multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) scanner. This imaging modality, known as photoacoustics, is a non-invasive imaging method that provides high spatial resolution and high penetration depth, resulting in a very high-quality image. The combined MSOT/contrast agent technology enables physicians to get real-time anatomical, physiological and functional information of the patient's affected organ.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to promote a liquid organic fertilizer (LOF) produced through a novel patented technology which uses anaerobic accelerated bio-leaching of green plant material or green plant waste. The synthetic free liquid organic fertilizer is a complex solution that contains macro nutrients, micro nutrient as well as organic matter in soluble form. The benefits of the proposed product include: (1) improvement of soil biological activities by providing the soil with soluble organic matter; (2) feeding the plants with soluble macro and micro nutrients; (3) ease of transportation; (4) ease of storage; (5) easy adjustment of the nutrient content through dilution; (6) easy application through irrigation systems and; (7) environmental benefit of carbon sequestration. Since no synthetic chemical is used for LOF production, it has the potential to be used as an economic alternative for currently used organic fertilizers such as fish emulsion and composts by the rapidly growing organic farming industry.

    This I-Corps project enables the extraction of plants macro and micro nutrients and organic matter from the body of green organic waste such as landscape grass clippings. The proposed novel technology consists of two simultaneous processes of anaerobic digestion and accelerated bio-leaching of organic waste to produce liquid organic fertilizer (LOF). Historically, the use of organic waste for production of organic fertilizer has been through composting. Research has shown that the proposed technology will require less time, lower energy consumption and easily available nutrients when compared to composting. In addition, LOF returns the plant organic carbon back to the soil and contributes to carbon sequestration. Previous studies have also shown that the use of LOF could lead to higher yield in vegetables when compared to synthetic fertilizer.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is in addressing a substantial challenge in  energy systems. The future electric power grid, commonly referred to as the smart grid, is expected to differ from the current system by the increased integration of distributed generation, demand response and sensing and communication technologies. As distributed energy resources become more prevalent and shape the future of the electric power grid, the overall operational flexibility of the grid increases.  This also means that more control decisions need to be made. This project provides an optimal coordination solution for coordinating geographically scattered energy resources. A commercially viable optimal coordination solution for ever increasing energy resources is crucial for cost efficient generation and dispatch of electricity and ensuring the reliability of the power grid. Specially, focusing on cold chain technologies, this project addresses scalable and flexible control and coordination of distributed refrigeration systems; it is envisioned that the proposed solution and software would turn end-users' pre-installed refrigerators and freezers into an integrated intelligent refrigeration system and significantly improve their energy efficiency.

    This I-Corps project provides a novel distributed control method that addresses a significant operational challenge of the distribution electric grid. Control of energy systems today is largely performed by centralized computing and control solutions run at central units. Increased infeed measurements (sensing data) result in growing stress and extended time for computations. Thus, centralized control solutions may not be feasibly computed and applied in real-time. This project contributes to fundamentally new methodologies and software for distributed computation of control decisions in real-time. Our research provides a promising solution for the intelligent control of distributed energy resources, which enables the efficient interaction and coordination of a variety of components with and by a central unit. The key premise in this research is that if coordinated in an intelligent, predictive and scalable way, operation of numerous energy resources can be optimized in real-time, thereby resolving the issue of scalability. In addition to extending the proposed distributed control methodology toward achieving reliable and cost effective energy and demand side management, this project focuses on commercializing a more target specific extension of the proposed approach directed at minimizing the operational cost of refrigeration systems in cold chain industries through enhanced distributed coordination.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will further develop new digitized manufacturing schemes, new materials and structures to construct compact laser photonic systems. It will open new innovation and product opportunities. The technology has potentials to yield robust and ultra-lightweight laser photonic systems with superior thermal management performance, which can be digitally manufactured at much lower cost than conventional means.  The innovation in manufacturing digitization and utilization of new materials and structures will allow rapid design modification and radical design innovation in developing laser and photonic systems for wider deployments on mobile drone platforms for a wide array of industrial, consumer, environmental, and military applications.

    This I-Corps project will evaluate several additive manufacturing process using both ceramic and metal powder feedstocks to build laser systems. The technology exploits the flexibility of the bottom-up manufacturing schemes to produce entire laser photonic systems made of flexure, cellular structures with embedded cooling and sensing functions. It will lead to drastic reduction on labor cost in manual assembly and alignments. Through combined optical, mechanic, and thermal design optimizations, we intend to completely digitize the manufacturing of laser photonic systems with advantages in weight, size, thermal, mechanic performance, manufacturing costs, which are unattainable by current commercial products.

    The broader impact/ commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to reduce loss of life in disaster rescue on rough terrain. Disaster rescue can endanger the lives of both the victims and the first responders, with the Red Cross reporting 400 deaths in disaster rescue in the past 20 years.  More than half of the casualties were volunteers who entered unchartered risky environments. Future deaths could be prevented by utilizing semi-autonomous technology to explore the regions of disasters, provide surveillance to inform first responders, and assist in the rescue of victims until human first responders can arrive. By dropping the proposed shape-shifting robots from aerial vehicles, these mobile robots could explore previously difficult to reach areas for effective emergency response. This proposed technology will also have broader impact in use for scientific monitoring and surveillance as well as for educational applications for K-12 students, teachers, parents, roboticists and hobbyists. With the potential to have large impact (with over 3 million potential teachers; 1 million teachers alone in secondary schools), robot kits could be marketed for educational applications, especially for schools trying to meet the Next Generation Science Standards.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to build a recommender system which assigns values to artifacts and will also provide stakeholders in unregulated markets with better information for reducing risk and improving trust. The Internet and technology have entirely changed the nature of interactions between every business sector, including the art industry, by creating a digital marketplace and introducing additional issues for markets regulation. The proposed recommender system can be used to predict value of investment, to provide an objective value of goods in legal proceedings, insurance cases, and banks as a collateral toll.  This supports financial stability of markets through better decision making and improves the trust of stakeholders in their investments. It also helps to maintain control of the commercial aspects of work. For example, the acquisitions departments of museums would be served by knowing a real value for the artifacts they buy.

    This I-Corps project is focused on building a recommender system for assigning values to artworks using existing datasets and deep knowledge. Art markets are often misvalued which makes the classical approach to building recommender systems rather difficult due to unreliable datasets. Classifiers trained on these datasets often assign inflated prices. A crowd approach is used here which is expected to give more reliable results. Personalization for this class of problems can be achieved by assigning semantic distance.  The project extends the group of classical features by adding semantic features from mining comments given by users, and, for example, from artist biographies, and images of paintings. For each cluster of semantically similar artists, a personalized recommender system for art evaluation is built. Wisdom of the crowd will be used to assign a specific value to an art piece.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will benefit epileptic patients by improving diagnostic systems for doctors, freeing them from manual scanning of continuous electroencephalogram results. This is expected to bring about significant reduction of cost in health care and enable novel commercial applications of monitoring of epileptic patients.  The nonlinear analysis technique applied in this project has the potential to open up new applications in neuroscience and may prove to be essential in recognizing how and why seizures occur as well as other neurological disorders. The high resolution of the approach also indicates a potential in identifying seizure precursors, which would better assess seizure susceptibility and ultimately lead to seizure suppression through external intervention.

    This I-Corps project further develops a reliable and automated seizure detection mechanism which will potentially aid medical practitioners and patients with epilepsy. The established practice for patients suspected of epilepsy is a manual process, highly labor-intensive, and prone to human error. The technology developed here addresses these problems by utilizing techniques from chaotic systems and nonlinear measures that more accurately describe brain activity and yield significantly more accurate results in seizure detection using EEG data compared to standard linear measures. It combines state-of-the-art solutions from both algorithms and computing hardware. At the heart of the method, there is a recently developed algorithm for the estimation of Lyapunov exponents, a measure of chaoticity, that was shown to provide unparalleled resolution and noise immunity.  This method is computationally expensive. To adhere to the real-time constraints of the application, the project employs parallelizable platforms such as multi-core CPUs/GPUs. Furthermore, complete automation will be achieved by testing out a number of shape detection algorithms through the use of neural networks and wavelet matching. The method has been tested on extensive records from animal models and some human data.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to improve food safety and security of hand harvested food crops through individualized geo-spatial data collection. Much like highway cameras have an ability to tell the status of traffic on a given freeway are vastly improved through the individualized data of each driver and their phones, hand harvested food can benefit from improving traceability and transparency from block level data to single points of harvest, recalling intersecting mapping data. Geo-specific data can also enable better land productivity measurement over textual block data.  Individualized, personally owned, data enables workers to have portability of information, building a resume of dependability and performance.  In addition, it becomes an integral component of a viable transparency scheme.  The project will potentially improve the economic standing of harvesters, improve the capability of farmers to better understand their workforce and land, assist marketers with improved data to insure against breakdowns in food safety, and enable consumers transparency without added steps to the system.

    This I-Corps project further develops improved data collection methods in high-value hand-picked specialty crops. The data in question is a precise record of who harvests what, where and when.  Contextual data (quality, irrigation/fertilization data, cultural practice maps, etc.) are added and visualized for farmers.  The project will test the relationship of data sets toward improved decision skills; better management depends on better measurement.  It provides a better understanding of inhomogeneities in space and time.  Addressing these inhomogeneities leading to investigation and reductions of variance.  The system will enables comprehension of bottlenecks and workflow problems in labor process and allow dynamic and real-time decisions.  The system will also allow quantitative approaches toward finding optimal decisions in several parts of the system and provide a platform for decentralized decision-making based on common data.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to explore the product-market fit  for a conceptual model-based math intelligent tutors (COMMIT) for teaching students with learning disabilities or difficulties in mathematics.  The technology will help overcome a current impediment for these students' success in mathematics, the shortage of response to intervention curriculum materials and service providers.  The COMMIT products will potentially address a practical issue in today's inclusive elementary classrooms: the need to deliver individualized and effective intervention programs to those students who are not responsive to or are struggling with mathematics content in their regular classrooms. The COMMIT products will also promote the implementation of evidence-based practice and translation of research into practice. Because the COMMITs emphasize a conceptual model-based problem solving approach that orients students' attention to deep problem structure, it is expected that this program can also be used to improve mathematical learning of elementary students more broadly.

    This I-Corps project, conceptual model-based math intelligent tutors (COMMIT), represents a shift from traditional mathematics problem-solving instruction, which focuses on the choice of operation for solution, to a model-based problem-solving approach that emphasizes an understanding and representation of mathematical relations in algebraic equations and therefore facilitates generalized problem solving skills. The COMMITs incorporate a constructivist view of mathematics learning so that the reasoning behind mathematics is explicit to the students. In other words, students will be able to make sense of what they are doing with mathematical models and abstract symbols. The COMMIT project will demonstrate how intelligent tutors will work with teachers in synergy and provide personalized curriculum recommendations that are based on a dynamic assessment of individual student's learning profile. COMMITs help build fundamental mathematical ideas that are essential to enabling struggling students to understand mathematics at a conceptual or abstract level.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to explore the commercial potential of an educational innovation that can transform aspects of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and arts education in both formal and informal settings through the construction, analysis, and performance upon a set of custom musical instruments.  By coupling rigorous STEM learning with musical concepts, the technology can engage a diverse group of students in STEM who may otherwise not express an interest.  The technology may be commercialized in a variety of ways, ranging from kits for the home market to complete curricula for school programs.  Commercialization of the technology has significant potential to improve educational outcomes in these important STEM areas.

    This I-Corps project builds upon a technology base of custom acoustical and electronic musical instruments that was initially developed for an educational program that has been attended by over 2,000 people in 10 states at schools, museums, and performing arts centers.  The intellectual merit of the work derives from the close coupling between musical content and state K-12 standards in mathematics, science, and engineering.  A pilot 6-week after school program for third grade students used the technology to draw connections between music and fractions, geometry, the physics of sound, engineering materials, and engineering design, which are all topics in the educational standards for that grade level.  Prototype instruments for higher grade levels illustrate concepts in algebra, pre-calculus, electronics, and computer programming.

    The broader impact of this I-Corps project involves a novel probiotic, which potentially treats gut problems including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), weight gain, and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO).  Many key mechanisms of the human body are in part control by the microbes that live in our gut. The way that we currently view, diagnose, and treat many diseases is fundamentally changing with this knowledge. While dozens of diseases are now intrinsically tied with dysbiosis in the gut, of which 1000s of species of microbes reside, we currently have few probiotics as treatment despite the fact that the number of human clinical trials on probiotics in the past 10 years has increased 20-fold. When developed, this technology can potentially be applied to supplements and drugs to help counter noncompliance, and therefore have a significant commercial impact in other fields as well. This is, in addition, to the broad reaching impact on helping individuals with gut problems, which is estimated to be over 50 million. This product also provides an irritant free alternative for those desiring a regular probiotic.

    This I-Corps project surrounds the bacteria, Paenibacillus 79-R4 (Pb 79-R4), which has been isolated and characterized.  In vitro trials show very encouraging results that indicated that this strain drastically reduces enteric methane and hydrogen production, which could be transferred to a commercial product.  Pb 79-R4 eliminates the gases that are positively correlated with gut problems in humans- in animal models the supplemental-Pb strain decreased methane-producing activity by over 50%. This technology will also include a prebiotic and a novel beverage-based interactive mode of delivery, which will work in synergy with the bacteria and lets the user know it is working allowing the effects of the probiotic to work faster and decrease the abandonment period in first-time users. In addition, results from in vitro simulations have resulted in significant reductions in certain pathogens.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to provide automatic prosthetic tuning technology that will enable the optimization of metabolic energy expenditure in impaired gait of amputee users. This product will simplify the process of tuning and will increase the performance of powered prosthetic legs to better assist users and provide more balance while maintaining a lower energy expenditure on residual muscles. Due to the product's user-friendly structure, it could easily be used in less-equipped environments, which will make the technology more accessible and eliminate the discomfort of long commutes to the prosthetic laboratory or clinics. This is a cost-effective solution for not only broader use of powered prosthetic legs, but also better efficiency of prosthetic laboratory and clinics to serve more prosthetic users. This will reduce the cost of maintaining powered prosthetic legs and, broaden the facilities that would offer these types of services. Also, since the system is automated a clinician will replace some of the tasks typically done by prosthetic experts, which is expected to reduce overall costs.

    This I-Corps project will explore the commercial potential of the core technology. Lower limb amputees use prosthetics for daily walking; however, walking with prosthesis typically requires much more metabolic energy expenditure than people with normal gait. Current state-of-the-art technology provides powered prosthetic legs to better assist amputees. To have the best assistance and to increase balance, these legs require a meticulous tuning procedure. It is currently conducted using an observation-based approach by prosthetic experts; however, this approach is not accurate and lacks objectivity. The developed technology is able to wirelessly collect body area sensor signals and provide computational algorithms to automatically setup powered prosthetic legs, which provides a novel and efficient technique for optimizing the metabolic energy expenditure in impaired gait of amputees. This technology will enable an accurate and objective tuning for the users, which is cost effective because it may reduce the need for frequent prosthetic clinics for prosthesis adaptation. In addition, the objective and accurate tuning will maximize the use of powered prosthetic legs.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to increase the applications of wearable sensory modality (vision, vestibular, and/or proprioception) specific devices to encourage mobility and optimize movement for patients suffering from increased disequilibrium symptoms, such as vertigo or dizziness, and other fall risk comorbidity factors. This project will potentially enhance the delivery of rehabilitative care by clinical providers to their patients by simultaneously improving their patients' health outcomes and quantitatively demonstrating value in their treatment plans. Similarly, by serving as a channel to implement balance interventions to mitigate the high rates of falls among older adults, this project will support efforts by health care providers, senior advocacy groups, and hospital facility administrators to reduce the associated treatment costs.

    This I-Corps project enables the ameliorating effects of low random vestibular stimulation on balance coordination during stance and locomotion to be extended during an individual's daily routine in a non-research or clinical setting. The basis for the technique is a wearable device capable of delivering low electrical currents non-invasively to the individual's vestibular system through the mastoids. Sensory reweighting and integration are paramount to sustaining balance control in dynamic environments and deficits in those processes are frequently associated with balance impairments during gait and stance. Therefore, by leveraging the apparent postural responses induced in an individual, the technology has the potential to support a variety of motor adaption or retraining paradigms for balancing training and fall prevention.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is clinicians being able to evaluate therapy impact implemented on individual patients by quantifying real-time tissue kinematics response to a procedure. While tools that objectify therapeutic intervention outcomes are desirable, they are not often available, where the procedure's results are usually unknown until it is too late to redirect the outcomes. Such a delay could exacerbate a patient's symptoms, requiring additional interventions or diagnostic tests, increasing costs and professional liabilities. This innovation greatly improves the possibility of objectifying therapy outcomes or planned interventions to ensure success on performed treatments. As an example, this innovation can quantify uterine C-section scar tissue integrity, allowing Obstetricians and Gynecologists to reduce risk during births that involve women with previous C-section history. Additional promising applications include, more precise speech language pathology diagnosis and physical therapy treatment validation.

    This I-Corps project is based on an innovative method that measures displacement and strain in tissue and body fluid for determining the accuracy and objectivity of clinical tests and the effectiveness of treatment procedures. The novel method developed, processes an image time series obtained using typical diagnostic tools, such as ultrasound, MRI, or CT scan imaging, to quantify target tissue displacement and strain. Contemporary methods, such as Tissue Doppler Imaging, require cross-sectional plane imaging, restricting strain measurements to a single component. The method developed here identifies functions without the necessity for natural markers and yields all components of the strain tensor field at a much finer resolution. Further, repeatability of this novel method's function has been assessed by conducting multiple in vitro and in vivo experiments. The method's versatility has been demonstrated by quantifying kinematics for variety of biological tissues, such as median and sciatic nerves, surrounding muscle, and subcutaneous tissue.

    The broader/commercial impact of this I-Corps project is a miniaturized, on-demand pharmaceutical manufacturing platform that is scalable and efficient to deploy, highly automated, and fast on product release. The project's aim is to reduce manufacturing and inventory cost and in turn overcome drug shortages. Broadly speaking, the current global pharmaceutical industry is prone to supply chain disruptions, drug shortages, and drug price hikes. One major contributing factor are legacy factories and processes which are limited to intermittent and slow production. Moreover, the outdated infrastructure has weaknesses in terms of product yield and environmental impact. Given the pressure of meeting demand for clinical trial supplies, uncertainties over approvals, and other resource constraints, drug development activities have often only been a series of process scale-ups with less emphasis on innovating on the next-gen manufacturing processes, which can be fundamentally better in all aspects in the long term. Consequently, this project is a significant push towards a more flexible, economical, greener, and, ultimately, more sustainable drug manufacturing infrastructure.

    This I-Corps project explores the commercial potential of a microfluidic-based, continuous-flow pharmaceutical manufacturing device. It represents a paradigm shift from conventional, labor-intensive, batch drug manufacturing processes. Microfluidics (MFDs) are fabricated microchannels which are up to a thousand times smaller than a conventional batch reactor for the same throughput. In turn, MFDs offer up to a thousand times increase in the surface area to volume ratio, allowing for extremely rapid heat and mass transfer and a suite of other advantages; Since the process is continuous, the system can be spatially integrated with state-of-the-art analytical sensors and computer-based controllers, by which the product quality can be assured not only by process design, but also by advanced process control. From a synthesis and purification perspective, MFDs allow for precise handling of previously inaccessible, but highly efficient, pressurized, and often exothermic pathways. This results in greener and safer processes with higher throughput and less waste. On the formulation side, MFDs provide homogeneous crystallization environments, leading to monodisperse crystal size distributions, which leads to superior reproducibility in key product quality such as shape and size.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project lies in offering modular and reconfigurable mobile robotics solutions for deployment in environments that maybe unsafe for humans.  Modularity offers a unique opportunity to address needs in multiple markets with a single solution when coupled with a suite of specific attachment modules.  It is envisioned that the platform will first be adopted by law enforcement.  Other market that will be explored include defense applications, where there seems to be interest in throwable robots.  Robotic assistance for environmental management is another potential market area.

    This I-Corps project is based on developments in small mobile robots for applications in search, rescue and reconnaissance.  This modular platform is designed to support efforts in the context of "robotics science of safety."  Novel aspects in design provide more advanced mobility characteristics than currently available platforms. The locomotion designs spawns new questions and opportunities for basic research in legged locomotion.  A modular form-factor makes this robot accessible to a larger audience, with an inexpensive baseline model that can be upgraded with sensor and hardware packages as needed by the customers.  Throwable, and miniature sized robots are currently an asset to operations involving reconnaissance, inspection and characterization in dangerous environments.  Driven by customer feedback, the features of this robot can carefully evolve to meet the needs of each customer segment.

    The commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to provide a computational platform that facilitates multiple entities to transact where data owned by different stakeholders is used but not disclosed to anyone, including the platform. The resulting transaction would allow entities to make informed decisions about not only choosing from a pool of potential partners but also explore avenues to generate value from their potential partnership(s). This platform eliminates any possibility of losing ownership of data as well as any misuse/abuse of data in transactions. Consequently, it would motivate partnerships among disparate entities, leading to value enhancements and new products. It can be a game changer in allowing a range of businesses to create new products/services, especially when such businesses are complimentary to each other.  Moreover, this platform would allow personalized service deliveries to end customers, involving different entities, who can collaborate without exchanging data.

    This I-Corps project uses a suite of building blocks within its computational platform to perform mutually-agreed computations. Each building block is designed to perform a specific arithmetic or a logical operation using a single external server (SES), wherein the server learns nothing about the inputs. The entities using these building blocks learn only the outputs of the computation but not their collaborators' inputs. Thus, computations executed using these building blocks preserve input confidentiality and data ownership for every involved entity. There are existing technologies that achieve some of the stated functionalities but they either use multiple external servers or computationally intensive cryptographic techniques. These requirements substantially affect the performance overhead and scalability, which make it difficult to deploy them in real-world applications. In contrast, this SES-based building blocks lead to substantial reductions in performance overhead as compared to the existing technologies and are easily scalable.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to act as a catalyst in the growth of distributed generation and microgrid industries. This artificial intelligence based control system will potentially provide an electrical network that is reliable by reducing outages and restoration costs with incredibly fast bidirectional power flow, secured with real time diagnostics, self-healing and adaptive capabilities, and more economical by reducing equipment failures and minimizing power losses. The product potentially three broad markets, including utilities, distributed generation and consumer. The solution will enhance energy generation from renewables, improve microgrid efficiency, reliability, stability and power quality, and add intelligent control to conventional power systems. Inverter capabilities are presently a significant challenge for integrating distributed generation sources. The proposed innovation would potentially provide an appropriate solution to address this challenge.

    This I-Corps project develops a neural network control technology for microgrid control and management. Microgrids are one path for integrating renewable and distributed generation sources into the grid and can generally support a future smart electricity grid.  A key challenge in microgrid adoption is adequate control of power inverters. Problems include high oscillations when connecting or disconnecting an energy source, fluctuating voltage and frequency, malfunctions and reliability, competing control between inverters, and high harmonic distortions. The proposed innovation uses adaptive dynamic programming and artificial neural networks to implement microgrid control. It integrates into one controller the advantages of conventional control methods, including optimal control, proportional integral control, predictive control, and sliding mode control. The proposed innovation has the potential to overcome the limitations of the conventional control technologies and better meet customer demands and requirements.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project includes providing weather-related risk information to construction contracting companies, private farmers, insurance and re-insurance companies, risk management companies, local, federal agencies, state agencies, and any other company that may be impacted by adverse weather. This product provides insight into the impacts of adverse weather conditions, allowing its constituents to plan and prepare. Construction companies need to stay on schedule to avoid liquidated damages, so it is important to determine the impacts of weather on work stoppage, as well as decreased labor productivity.  Insurance and risk management companies need information on the impacts of weather events on their constituents, to be able to competitively price their insurance policies. Furthermore, government agencies, such as the Departments of Transportation and Public Works need information on the impacts of weather on duration of their projects, to determine the best starting date for construction, considering impacts of weather on delays.

    This I-Corps project provides a software tool (Weather Augmented Risk Determination System, WARDS) for estimating probabilities of work stoppage and labor productivity for each hour using long-term observations. WARDS provides both the likeliest delay (e.g., in days or months) and the likelihood that a user-defined addition of time for weather delay will actually occur.  The research potential for this product include analyzing the differences in labor productivity and work stoppage across multiple locations. Furthermore, the technology platform can determine the historical observed changes in labor productivity and work stoppage. The product can determine the monetary impacts of changing labor productivity and work stoppage due to weather.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is an efficacious alternative for antibiotics and in treating antibiotic resistant bacteria in a number of fields, including, healthcare, self-care, agriculture, sanitation, animal health, and research. The CDC estimates that in 2013 more than 2 million people had an antibiotic resistant infection, and 23,000 people died due to antibiotic resistance. The costs to society of antibiotic resistance are $20 billion in direct medical costs, and as much as $35 billion in lost productivity-these are the savings in healthcare alone. The potential impact on self-care is a competitive and safe alternative to OTC treatments for bacterial related issues, such as acne, which affects more than 80% of the population at some point in their lives, and has a market size of $644 million. The potential impact on the animal health industry would be a replacement for growth-promoting antibiotics.

    This I-Corps project core technology is a software and hardware platform that combines a method for creating precision disease models with a novel solution for the discovery of a narrow band lytic bacteriophage. This discovery platform enables the elimination of many of the bottlenecks and short falls of traditional phage and antibiotic product discovery to improve isolation rates of unique, diverse anti-infective candidates. When used in conjunction with regular metagenomic monitoring of a target environment, the technology is able to model a custom phage cocktail to ensure a specific functional profile using combinatorics.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project it to reduce the impact of future earthquakes.  This smartphone-based crowdsource sensing application provides earthquake alerts and shaking hazard data. The vision is to provide earthquake early warning around the globe, and collect data on building performance.  Warnings can be used to slow and stop trains reducing the likelihood of derailment, to isolate hazardous chemicals and machinery to reduce damage, to move data to safe storage, and to signal individuals to move to a safe place.  Shaking data recoded in buildings can also be used to assess the performance of a building during an earthquake.  Recorded shaking in smaller non-damaging quakes can be used to predict building performance in larger events.  The data recorded by application enabled phones can potentially be used by structural engineers to assess buildings, and can be used by the insurance industry to set premiums.

    This I-Corps project develops a global smartphone-based seismic network.  The technology uses machine learning techniques to distinguish between earthquakes and other sources of shaking as recorded on personal/private smartphones, and is embedded in the application that has been downloaded by over 250,000 users around the world.  When a phone detects an earthquake, it notifies a central server.  The server confirms the earthquake based on multiple phone detection, and estimates the size and location.  An alert could then be issued to users.  At the same time, the phone records the ground shaking during the earthquake.  This timeseries data can be used for a range of purposes including fundamental research on earthquake processes, and characterization of buildings.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to generate technology that improves the accuracy of medical diagnostic tests and eases restrictions on the collection of tissue from patients. If it can be widely disseminated through commercialization, this technology will allow patients to receive a more accurate diagnosis of diseases like cancer, with a more rapid turnaround time and lower cost to the healthcare system. Moreover, secondary biopsies or blood draws that are painful and expensive can be avoided. The project has exceptional potential for commercialization due to the multi-billion dollar market for diagnostic tests at present and due to clear pressing clinical needs to fill in technological gaps that limit the accuracy of diagnostic tests for cancer.

    The I-Corps project is focused on a new generation of light-emitting nanoparticles that function as the critical means to perform measurements in medical diagnostic tests. These new nanoparticles, called quantum dots, provide the new ability to count individual molecules in diseased tissue and in blood, which is a major leap forward in diagnostic testing compared with standard tests that simply provide a qualitative outcome of "high" or "low." Moreover, quantum dots allow the simultaneous interrogation of numerous classes of molecules related to diseases, instead of having to perform repeated tests. Importantly, this technology can be implemented on low-cost instruments that are already widely available in medical diagnostics labs, so there are few barriers preventing entry into the market.  Outcomes have been validated in a research laboratory setting, however they must be scaled for commercialization and finely tuned to meet specific needs in medical diagnostics settings.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is providing an affordable and effective means to produce freshwater supplies from brackish water sources. Freshwater shortages have pushed many communities to increasingly rely on groundwater supplies. Several hundred million people worldwide already experience serious water-stress, and their numbers are expected to increase as freshwater availability declines owing to increasing demand.  While available fresh groundwater aquifers are limited, there exist considerable amounts of low-to-intermediate salinity brackish groundwater sources that remain unused. Unfortunately, existing desalination technologies are either too energy intensive, have low water recovery rates, or are prohibitively expensive. There is a significant need and commercial opportunity for new technologies that can efficiently convert brackish aquifers into viable freshwater supplies. This project allows for the development of a robust, low cost, energy efficient brackish water desalination technology with potential use beyond drinking water treatment, including food processing, agriculture, and other industrial applications.

    This I-Corps project will evaluate the commercialization potential of a new technology that will potentially lower the cost of brackish water treatment by reducing the capital, operation and maintenance, and waste management costs compared to existing alternatives. The lower capital cost is achieved by using novel composite electrode materials developed using inexpensive and industrially-scaled precursors. The reduction in operation and maintenance costs are benefits from realizing unique operating modes made possible by the novel electrodes. The new operating modes also eliminate need for harsh chemicals, and instead use low-voltage electricity to regenerate the electrodes after they have captured the dissolved salts from the water being treated.  The regeneration leads to a reject stream of concentrated brine, while the adsorption leads to a stream of treated water that is fresh (less saline than the inlet water). The higher water recovery rates in this system minimize the amount of waste generated, subsequently allowing for cost savings in waste management.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project can transform the waste vegetable oil industry and influence the markets of other biofuels.  The innovative method comes from using a modular design with novel supercritical processing technology that utilizes value added by-product recycle.  This technology improves profitability by bringing processing facilities closer to the consumer and creating local jobs in rural communities, thus improving rural economic activity.   The commercial potential of this technology can transform how waste vegetable oil is used, rendered, and processed in the United States and around the world.  These marketplaces are of significant interest to the federal and state governments because of energy security, rural economic growth and sustainable energy production.  Commercial impacts of this technology influence other biofuels markets.

    This I-Corps project will explore the market potential  of a Transportable Micro Bio Refinery (TmBR) that converts waste vegetable oil (WVO) into biodiesel to using a novel 2-stage Separative-reactor.  Generating biodiesel from WVO is commonly done using a Base-Catalyzed Low-Pressure process referred to as the Fatty-Acid Methyl Ester (FAME) process.  Bio-diesel produced in centralized bio-refineries are not competitive with petro-diesel with low priced crude.  Capital costs, feedstock supply costs, and environmental costs to dispose of process waste make centralized refineries uneconomically.  By comparison, the TmBR process uses an advanced super-critical separative reactor without a catalyst to reduce process waste and operating costs.  In addition, the TmBR process includes a bio-digestor to convert waste glycerol to methanol which is recycled to reduce the need to purify and dispose of waste glycerol.  The TmBR process requires a smaller operating footprint, involves lower capital costs and reduced operating costs and has less environmental impact that makes this technology more economically competitive compared to standard FAME based biodiesel plants.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to develop an understanding of the market needs for a novel biodegradable tether and inserter technology. Researchers have developed an inserter device which delivers a temporary tether into living tissue that can constrain medical devices within the body, while also permitting those devices to be easily removed if desired. Numerous surgical and implant applications might benefit from commercialization of this technology, and the market needs for these applications will be explored in this project.  A potential application of the technology is with postpartum intrauterine devices (IUD) where this will mitigate medical complications caused by IUD expulsion events.

    This I-Corps project focuses on a novel technology for inserting a biodegradable tether into living tissue and interfacing with existing medical devices.  This technology must permit the medical devices to be held in place during normal operation, but allow easy removal when desired.  Researchers have fabricated alpha and beta prototypes that demonstrate reliable insertion of a biodegradable tether into explanted muscle tissue and shown sufficient anchoring force to constrain a medical device.  Using the same tether, researchers have demonstrated easy removal of a medical device.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is in allowing property owners to fully develop their land for economic benefit, while satisfying regulatory requirements and, at the same time, protecting the water resources that we rely on for water supply, environmental benefits and recreation. Currently, land owners use developable land to manage storm water. This project will consider how to best use the soil throughout the site to manage the storm water and free up more of the site for development. By spreading out runoff that naturally concentrates when we construct buildings, roads and parking lots more water can soak into the ground. With this infiltration, pollutants picked up on the land surface can be removed by the soil rather than flowing directly to a stream. Infiltrated water moves underground to streams and provides the continuous stream flow needed by wildlife. Distributing runoff to the soil surrounding our buildings and pavement can also help keep runoff out of the combined storm and sanitary sewers found in many older communities, allowing the aging infrastructure to continue to function and reducing the combined sewer overflows.

    This I-Corps project will result in a new solution, transforming the way storm water runoff is managed; improving water quality and maintaining stream baseflow required by wildlife, while decreasing costs and requiring less space to meet permitting requirements. The solution consists of devices that are specially constructed to slow down the flow of water and redirect it in a way that allows it to seep into the surrounding soil. The core technology is based upon the well-established principle that the size, mix and way materials are arranged determines the way liquids flow. A patent for the solution has been issued because of the new, innovative way of constructing and deploying these simple materials (i.e., sand and gravel placed in tubes of the geotextile fabric often used in landscaping), allowing water to be directed in three dimensions. Concentrated runoff, for example the accelerated flow of water off a parking lot, that is intercepted by the device, is first slowed and then directed down into the soil or is moved left or right to the next device segment.

    The broader impact of this I-Corps Team project is a new collagen-mimetic material that will lead to the development of safer, cheaper, and customizable products for medical applications. Collagen has applications in medicine, pharmaceuticals, personal care products, food industry, and leather industry.  The incidences of transmission of pathogens from animal products have added to the market pressure for safer, non-mammalian sources of collagens. The novel, collagen-mimetic fibrils are expected to be a safe collagen-alternative for many collagen-related applications.  These new materials can be designed to cater the needs of specific applications and is potentially more versatile and effective than the traditional collagen products. The potential commercial impact is a new generation of collagen-related biomaterials for skin care, bone and joint health, controlled drug release devices, and wound healing.

    This I-Corps Team project will identify and establish relationships with potential partners across the medical field and the personal care industry. Collagen has long been sought after for its combination of tensile strength and biocompatibility. The emerging peptide biotechnology raised hope of producing collagen-mimetic peptides that can be a safe, economically viable alternative to collagens extracted from animals. Until recently, however, protein design could not produce peptide materials that adapt to the fibril conformation of natural collagens. This project builds upon the development of the first of such fibril-forming triple helical peptide. The self-assembled collagen-mimetic fibrils have the characteristic axial repeating structure reminiscent of that of the D-period of fibrillar collagens in tissues. The collagen-mimetic fibrils can be used as molecular scaffold to create biomaterials that have the supramolecular structure and the tensile strength comparable to that of natural collagen fibrils. The bottom-up approach makes it possible to customize the materials for specific applications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to introduce a fully integrated current sensor with an order of magnitude performance improvement over the state-of-art technologies. The developed technology will enable more reliable, efficient and compact power electronics systems. Power electronics is an integral part of today's power delivery systems such as renewable energy systems, electric vehicles, data centers and most consumer electronics. In these applications, electric current information is often an essential parameter that needs to be known and measured for control, diagnostic and prognostic purposes. With advances in power electronic circuits with specific attention to high frequency power converters, there is a need to investigate alternative approaches and techniques to measure the current. These approaches should result in availability of current sensors that have fast-response, are accurate, loss-less, and preferably non-intrusive. The impact of such a sensor is to enable systems and circuits that will be miniaturized and more efficient through the use of wide band-gap semiconductors and high switching frequencies. Additionally, the availability of current measurement information will lead to greater reliability and prognostic capability. Applications include power converters in electric vehicles and data centers.

    This I-Corps project will explore the commercial potential of the current sensor technology in different industry sectors such as automotive, telecommunications, and data centers. Today, there is no current sensor that can be used in many power electronics systems or integrated into semiconductor modules optimized to operate with switching frequencies beyond 1MHz. This project will address the need and requirements for such sensors by moving away from commonly-used Hall-Effect sensors and utilizing magneto-resistors. With proprietary IC circuitry and packaging, the project team is developing contactless, lossless sensors with bandwidths up to 10 MHz, while overcoming the measurement challenges due to EMI, asymmetrical current distributions and non-uniform magnetic field.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of simple and low-cost point-of-care microfluidic molecular (DNA/RNA) tests that are designed to be used in decentralized or low-resource settings. Currently, point-of-care tests for infectious diseases are predominately done in a paper dipstick format. Although these dipstick tests are inexpensive, they have limited sensitivity. As an alternative, the most sensitive detection method entails DNA/RNA detection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), however PCR testing often requires time-consuming manual steps and costly equipment. Because of its cost, PCR is generally confined to centralized laboratories, so front-line decentralized clinics can suffer days to weeks of delay in testing results because samples need to be sent out for testing. Low-cost nucleic acid detection is desirable for point-of-care diagnostics; The availability of an on-site molecular tests will give doctors a powerful tool to confirm diagnosis of infectious diseases and allow faster treatment with higher sensitivity. This project will help confirm the best product-market strategy to deploy the technology, and guide the development of devices that makes positive impact for better patient management, increased accessibility to molecular testing, and a faster response to epidemics.

    This I-Corps project is based on several patented microfluidic technologies developed for on-site nucleic acid detection. The microfluidic chip is designed to reduce molecular testing setup costs by 100X. The key technologies include vacuum based self-powered microfluidic chips that do not require any costly equipment often necessary seen in conventional microfluidic setups (such as external pumps, controllers, valves, or power sources). This allows the microfluidic test to be a fraction of the cost compared to conventional microfluidics. The vacuum technology also makes the microfluidic chips fully portable and easily transportable, which is ideal for decentralized point-of-care use. It was also possible to perform sample preparation with the vacuum based microfluidic technology.  Using this vacuum based microfluidic platform, it is possible for rapid quantitative digital nucleic acid detection of drug resistant bacteria DNA directly from human blood samples within 30 minutes. These technical features are important building blocks for building autonomous, portable, lab-on-chip technologies for a future generation of low-cost molecular diagnostic assays.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will increase American manufacturing competitiveness and open new product opportunities.  The technology has the potential to expand the application space for 3D printing by removing current limitations on materials, achievable properties, and processing speed.  This will allow users to customize parts to user needs and reduce lead times for industries from medical devices to aerospace, to consumer products.  There are many opportunities in the 3D printing industry because it is rapidly growing (>15-20% per year).  The new approaches to manufacturing are transforming a wide variety of industries despite many pressing technical issues that remain.  The technology behind this project can open new markets/industries for these technologies by addressing some of the critical limitations.

    This I-Corps project will evaluate a modified process for additive manufacturing (3D Printing) with polymers from a powder feedstock. This is typically done by scanning the powder bed with a laser to locally fuse the powder particles together.  An alternative method is developed here that allows for economical fusing of the powder over longer time periods.  Current laser-based methods are constrained to utilizing a few specialized material types due to the process constraints.  While these work for many applications, there are many applications that require specialized materials that cannot be used in the current additive manufacturing methods.  This technology has the potential to expand the range of materials that can be successfully processed.  Additionally, the material properties produced by current methods are reduced relative to those obtained using traditional approaches such as injection molding.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to create a closed loop synthetic carbon cycle that addresses both carbon dioxide (CO2) mitigation as well as generating high value hydrocarbons from waste CO2 feedstock. Currently, fossil-fuel-fired power plants typically exhibit significant emissions of CO2.  The process developed here has the potential to capture this waste CO2 and repurpose it towards generation of hydrocarbon fuels and other high value hydrocarbons. It presents an opportunity for these electricity generation units to add profit margin in their business model based on these hydrocarbon chemicals. Similar opportunities are available to positively impact many other industries, as well.

    This I-Corps project develops a sustainable repurposing of CO2. The process, reverse water gas shift chemical looping (RWGS-CL) has demonstrated capability of converting CO2 to CO at high rates and at low temperatures, paving the way for implementation at large scale. The temperatures of operation of RWGS-CL allows for thermal integration with Fischer Tropsch process (FTS). With FTS reactors already being used in industrial scale, the reactor module developed here can potentially find an appropriate use in those industries. This process involves the use of stable catalysts that can be used for several cycles without loss of activity. The process is designed such that there is no intermixing of CO and H2O or H2, thereby restricting any methane formation or any backward reaction.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project would be in the development of a new approach to anti-fouling that can be used synergistically with other existing approaches. Surface fouling is encountered in a vast range of situations: biofouling of ships, biofouling of medical implant devices, thrombus formation on blood-contacting surfaces, mineral scale formation, and a variety of foulants in the food and chemicals industries. Surface fouling has high costs ranging from increased fuel cost in ships, poorer heat exchange in the chemical industry, infection or repeated surgery in the medical contexts, and increased equipment costs in water treatment. The technology offers wide-ranging benefits to society ranging from reduced infection of implanted medical devices, reduced operating costs in membrane filtration, and longer equipment life in the chemical industry.

    This I-Corps project seeks to evaluate the commercial potential of a new approach to anti-fouling surfaces. The fundamental principle underlying the strategy is to focus mechanical stress to the interface between the foulant and the surface, and thereby force deadhesion of the foulant. Successful in vitro experiments have been conducted showing that this principle can greatly reduce the fouling of surfaces placed in contact with blood or with platelet-enriched plasma. These results suggest that the principle can be applied regardless of the chemical nature of the surface.  The anti-fouling principle is purely mechanical and therefore may be used in conjunction with chemical modification approaches, such as fluorination. The technology is presently being evaluated with other foulants in a non-medical context, for instance in algal growth or mineral scale formation.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to lower costs and increase the diversity of biofuels, chemicals, and therapeutics that can be produced by engineered cells that are used as 'living factories' in the biomanufacturing industry. Because cells are alive, they accumulate mutations as they grow. These mutations often reduce or even eliminate a cell's ability to make the product it was designed to manufacture. This project aims to commercialize technology for diagnosing what 'failure' mutations accumulate in these cells during production in large bioreactors. This capability will provide biotech companies with valuable information that they can use to re-engineer cells to prevent mutations from leading to losses of product yield. Thus, it has the potential to speed the progress of many new, renewable biomanufacturing processes from early R&D test stages to economically viable commercial production at scale.

    This I-Corps project centers on technology that provides diagnostic reports on the genetic stability of cells used in biomanufacturing through a combination of advanced next-generation sequencing and software workflows. This process can identify mutations that lead to a loss of production in a cell population while they are thousands of times rarer than can be detected by standard methods. Mutations that are rare when cells are grown at small scale will become dominant when cells are grown at larger production scales. Many such potential future failure mutations can be profiled in one small bioreactor using this technology. Comprehensively identifying failure mutations earlier in a R&D pipeline in this way such that they can re-engineer cells to prevent these problems before scale-up will save companies developing these processes time and money. This project explores the commercial viability of a service that provides these 'stability reports' to biomanufacturing companies in order to allow them to more rapidly overcome research and development obstacles related to mutations.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps proposal lies in its potential to enable a new degree of precise control over medicines that could substantially increase the efficacy of many current therapeutics as well as re-invigorate the potential of drugs that previously failed clinical trials owing to unfavorable toxicity profiles. By enabling clinician-defined control over when and where a drug is active in the body, this technology has the potential to improve the efficacy of on-target effects while mitigating toxic side-effects that decrease patients' quality of life. Not only do pharmaceutical companies invest significant time and money honing the pharmacokinetics of each drug they bring to market, once a drug is in the clinic, companies have no means of altering the final product to adapt to the individual needs of patients. This project could streamline the costly process of tuning drugs' pharmacokinetics, while also improving their efficacy for a broader patient population.

    This I-Corps project is based on the combination of two enabling technologies. It combines advances in molecular engineering to create molecules whose activity can be controlled using different wavelengths of light, with a process for identifying light-responsive molecules that possess specific therapeutic properties of interest. Suites of light-switchable molecules have been designed in non-therapeutic contexts as a proof-of-concept, though these technologies have not yet been applied to therapeutics. A research pipeline for applying this technology to medically important molecules is being developed.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to apply innovative statistical methods of trait prediction to improve flavor in the agricultural, beverage and food industries. In conjunction with a growing societal concern about food safety and quality, there has been an increasing interest in developing food products that have enhanced flavor. Because many of the compounds that determine flavor are also associated with health benefits, increasing their content can also have other positive consequences. The development and commercial application of methods that predict and improve the flavor properties of food products will have a significant impact in an industry that is constantly seeking to increase consumer appeal of their products. In addition, the generation of large databases that relate flavor with the presence of specific compounds will be used to identify new additives for the food industry.  These favorable compounds can be potentially commercialized as a flavor enhancing additives.

    This I-Corps project aims at determining the commercial potential of new approaches developed to predict flavor and consumer appeal of food products using statistical methods, and identify those flavor-related compounds that are most valuable to the food industry. Food texture, flavor and odor are determined by chemical (e.g. volatiles) and physical properties, of which many can be quantified by mass spectrometry. By characterizing these compounds, innovative statistical Bayesian methods can be used to account for their combined effects in consumer appeal. As a consequence, it is possible to predict in advance how new products will perform in the market based on their individual profile. Despite the clear relevance of flavor to consumer preference and many of their well-described health benefits, many industries have been largely unable to incorporate these traits into their products. The approaches developed here will fill that gap. This innovation permits rapid, low-cost and high-throughput identification of cultivars that are most probable to be favored by consumers, without the need to establish costly, low-throughput consumer or expert flavor panels.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will be to improve the efficiency with which cellulosic ethanol can be produced. Cellulosic ethanol is produced from agricultural waste products, like corn stalks, switchgrass, and wheat straw, rather than from corn like traditional ethanol. It is then used largely as a fuel additive, though other industries use ethanol on smaller scales. Improving cellulosic ethanol production is part of the United States' Renewable Fuel Standards Goals set in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. These improvements are vital since the increased demand for ethanol from corn has contributed to rises in food prices.  In addition, cellulosic ethanol produces fewer greenhouse gases than corn ethanol production, and reduces pressure for water use and land change erosion. However, despite these advantages, the vast majority of ethanol produced in the US is from corn, simply because cellulosic ethanol is considerably more expensive to produce. The costs reductions from the process developed here will potentially be of considerable commercial value to existing cellulosic ethanol producers, as well as potentially to corn ethanol producers who may switch production methods if costs become comparable.

    This I-Corps project further develops a technology that stabilizes genomes of metabolically active yeast. A key step in cellulosic ethanol production, co-metabolism of five- and six-carbon sugars, can be achieved by yeast hybrids consisting of species that ferment one or the other carbon source. But yeast hybrids created by protoplast fusion are genetically unstable, being subject to rapid segregational loss of one or the other parental genome. Preliminary data indicate that genomic instability can be prevented by encapsulating hybrids in calcium alginate and can produce ethanol at near-theoretical yields for weeks on end. This technology has a wide variety of potential applications. It has already been used to study aging, and could be further used to improve plasmid retention in the production of diverse synthetic biology products, including insulin, anti-malarial drugs, and industrially important solvents and lubricants. Current research is focused on optimizing this method for cellulosic ethanol production, with plans in place to subsequently address these other markets.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is in the arena of energy-efficient solid state lighting. It has been estimated that 20% of all electricity generated in the US is for lighting purposes. Solid state lighting uses far less energy to produce the same amount of effective lighting than incandescent or fluorescent bulbs. Additionally, it neither poses the environmental risk of releasing elemental mercury, nor does it require restricted disposal as do compact fluorescent bulbs. Organic Light Emitting Diodes (OLEDs) are more energy efficient and flexible than simple Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs), which are made of brittle inorganic materials. OLEDs are >90% more efficient than incandescent light bulbs, and have the potential to be >98% more efficient. Therefore, OLED technology has the potential to dramatically reduce lighting costs and the associated electrical generation preventing the release of billions of tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. OLED screens are steadily displacing other technologies used in portable, battery-operated devices such as cell phones, laptops, and tablets, and in TV's, airplane cockpits, and cars.

    This I-Corps project addresses a technological bottleneck for current OLED devices in the materials used for the generation of blue light. The materials currently in use have a fluorescent emission, which requires higher voltages resulting in greater energy consumption, more heat generation, and faster breakdown of the material in the device. Current manufacturers have adapted by using a layer of blue material that is twice the thickness of that in the red and green diode, which poses challenges for engineering the device structurally. The red and green diodes use a phosphorescent material requiring less voltage for generating the emission, thus, reducing energy consumption and heat generation. This project will evaluate the market potential of a new phosphorescent, true-blue emitting material for commercial applications that has greater thermal and chemical stability and is highly quantum efficient. During the project period, the team will gather information from OLED manufacturers to device makers to discern the need, cost-point, and interest for new raw materials, and how to fine tune the materials to better suit applications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the creation of a platform technology with a rapidly deployable, motorized arm that can be used wherever rapid, precise positioning of objects is required.  There are many potential medical, commercial, industrial, and consumer applications for the technology.  In the industrial sector there are needs to position and hold for assembly, soldering, gluing, welding, or metrology.  The device can also support needs for mechanical assistance during disassembly and re-assembly in maintenance operations.  Consumer applications include holding tablets, books, or laptops and adjustable workbench arms.  Medical applications include surgical retraction and surgical device or tool holding, including laparoscopic instruments.  The first target application in development is an abdominal surgical retraction system that can be deployed and/or adjusted within seconds.  A rapidly deployable retractor reduces operating room and anesthesia times.  Further, since the retractor arm is disposable, the risk of infection is reduced, and the need for cleaning, sterilization, and maintenance is eliminated.

    This I-Corps team has developed a device that consists of a motorized base with an attached flexible arm that can be locked into place and/or adjusted in seconds at the push and release of a button.  Various grippers can be attached to the end of the arm to firmly and steadily grasp or support an object at any orientation.  The speed and flexibility of these devices provide advantages over slower, manually operated fixtures, especially when working in and around complex geometries or fragile environments.  The intellectual property consists of a unique joint surface that permits the mechanical arm to be made much longer and stronger than competing systems.  A first generation system that operates as a surgical retractor was built and demonstrated before surgeons in mock scenario in a hospital operating room.  It was shown to be capable of providing adequate retraction force for abdominal surgeries.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is substantial improvement of animal health and well-being, food safety, and public health through more effective and safe vaccines. Vaccination is a critical tool for the control of infectious diseases, and new vaccine technologies are needed to address challenges resulting from new emerging infectious diseases and increased restrictions on the use of antibiotics. They are essential for increasing global animal protein production to meet the demand of the growing human population. Nanoparticle-based vaccine adjuvant technology can enhance the performance and safety of vaccines used in food animals. The incorporation of this technology in licensed vaccines will improve animal health and well-being, help to reduce economic losses caused by infectious diseases, and decrease reliance on antibiotics. As many infectious diseases, like influenza, can be transmitted from animals to people, control of these diseases is also critical for the protection of public health.

    This I-Corps project is based on a new plant-derived nanoparticle adjuvant technology. Adjuvants are compounds that are added to vaccine formulations to enhance the protective immune response. Current vaccine adjuvants have a number of challenges including lack of efficacy with certain vaccine antigens, instability, non-biodegradable ingredients, and association with adverse effects. Nanoparticles are attractive candidates for new generation vaccine adjuvants, but many nanoparticles are synthesized chemically in the lab, expensive to produce, and difficult to scale up to meet the need of mass vaccinations. Certain varieties of plants have naturally occurring alpha-D-glucan nanoparticles that can be modified to give them immunostimulatory properties. The surface properties of the nanoparticles enables effective activation of immune cells, which contributes to the strong immune protection induced by the vaccines. The fact that the particles naturally exist in plants makes their preparation affordable and easy to scale up, and suitable for use in vaccines. In addition, the naturally occurring particles are stable in formulation, but biodegradable following injection minimizing possible adverse reactions associated with vaccine adjuvants.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is focused on assessing and meeting the demand for a domestic source of high efficiency lithium ion batteries for custom electronic applications. The project investigates the commercialization potential of nanomaterial-enhanced high-performance lithium ion batteries for such applications as small satellites, remote sensing devices, and unmanned vehicle applications, where performance is paramount.  The desired use of these specific applications is often severely limited by the mass or volumetric energy density of commercial-of-the-shelf batteries.  Providing a rechargeable battery with improved energy density would enable longer missions, expanded sensing capability, and a larger communication range in these applications, and presumably a host of other portable electronic systems. An initial focus of the investigation with be within the U.S. defense and intelligence communities, whose use of such technologies has expanded dramatically over the past several years.  Successful commercialization of these batteries will provide the U.S. with improved protection and monitoring systems.

    This I-Corps project exploits the use of nanomaterials to enhance the performance of conventional lithium ion batteries. The project further develops energy dense lithium ion battery electrodes through the combination of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), high capacity active materials, and high areal capacity loadings.  This combination increases the relative mass of active to inactive materials that can store lithium in the cell, thus increasing its energy density.  In addition, the technology offers ancillary improvements in cycle life and suppression of the fading that occurs with increased charge/discharge rates.  This performance relies on the incorporation of CNTs as a conductive additive at a lower weight loading than conventional carbons, like carbon black and graphite, enabling improved mechanical properties and a more effective means of providing electrical percolation. The use of CNTs additives enables thicker electrodes, with more active material by volume, and a more efficient use of the active materials.

    The broader impact/ commercial potential of this I-Corps project is wide reaching with potential applications for the naocomposites that range from active anode material for advanced batteries to electronic ink. Advanced batteries for electric vehicles can offer the opportunity to achieve longer range (reduce range anxiety), higher power solutions (for nimble acceleration and handling), increased range of operating temperatures (increased utility in colder climates). Similar improvements will impact portable electronics and power tools.  In all cases, but particularly in military and aerospace applications, low weight and longer lasting portable energy sources are critical, and batteries using materials with these characteristics will support important technological advances in these wide-ranging applications.  The batteries based on these technologies will likely have lower manufacturing cost compared to current technology.

    This I-Corps project further develops and explores the commercialization potential of a carbon and oxygen-based two-dimensional nanocomposite that has novel electronic properties (ranging from semi-conducting to conducting) and morphology (1:1-Carbon:oxygen ratio, layered structure, flexible).  This combination of properties can benefit applications where materials development is critical for future technological advances. In particular, these materials are made from non-toxic, abundant materials with controllable electronic properties and nanocomposite structure. Recent efforts in the lab have focused on scaling up the production quantity of these materials. This supports the idea that determining strategies for manufacturing scale-up can be achieved once the specific required properties, application and required quantities have been identified.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to provide an effective and low-cost means for inhibiting the growth of pathogenic or problematic bacteria in the environment. There is growing concern that the widespread use of antibiotics and biocides has promoted the evolution of resistant bacterial strains for which there exist few effective treatments. The proposed technology is being developed as a safer and more environmentally sustainable alternative to antibiotics and biocides, or may be used as part of a combination treatment to enhance their effects. Additionally, the proposed technology is selective, and can target specific bacteria within a population, thus preserving the function of beneficial species. Successful implementation of this project will lead to the development of a wide range of products useful for controlling bacteria in both built and natural environments. Specific applications are expected to include the control of agricultural pathogens, mitigation of petroleum reservoir souring, optimization of wastewater treatment processes, and microbiome engineering.

    This I-Corps project is based on a novel technology platform for the isolation and application of extremely wide host-range (polyvalent) bacteriophages (viruses that only infect bacteria). The vast majority of bacteriophages reported in scientific studies and developed for commercial use have had a narrow host-range, likely due to the use of biased isolation techniques. In contrast, the proposed technology preferentially isolates only very wide host-range bacteriophages. Polyvalent bacteriophages have the potential to be significantly more effective than narrow host-range bacteriophages at controlling target bacteria in many natural and built environments, including biofilms. They have been shown to be 10- to 100-fold more effective at inhibiting the growth of their target bacteria, and have been successfully utilized to eliminate 99.99% of an antibiotic resistance gene from a wastewater sample. When used in combination with antibiotics or biocides, the technology is expected to work synergistically, enabling long-term and more complete control of problematic bacteria.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will be focused on improving design process efficiency for product development teams. This project will explore implementation of a web-based software that will be scalable, cost effective and comprehensive. Currently, many small to medium manufacturers cannot afford long-term simulation software due to high licensing and operating costs. To ensure durability, they rely heavily on a series of full-scale physical tests. Manufacturers who can afford existing software suites still utilize extensive physical testing, as simulation results are not solely adequate. This innovative technology allows for intelligent design changes and improvements to be implemented prior to prototyping and testing at an affordable rate for all manufacturers. This can significantly reduce the industry's reliance on physical testing, which can increase design time and product development costs.

    This I-Corps Project relies on an innovative relationship between the multi-scale hardness properties of a material and its long-term fatigue performance. By measuring the hardness of material, the technology can predict long-term product life. Currently, durability simulations are performed utilizing finite element analysis simulations and experimentally obtained material fatigue properties, neglecting important processing properties such as hardness and roughness. As a result, such simulations are often not accurate enough to predict the long-term performance of a product and thus necessitating physical testing for verification. The inclusion of processing parameters obtained through hardness testing in such simulation allows the designer to take into account many other contributing material factors and create a more robust and comprehensive simulation. This more accurate prediction of long-term product performance can drastically reduce the amount of physical testing necessary to verify a product is ready for the market. Using the multi-scale material properties from the hardness test, the proposed web-based software solution will be able to assist product engineers in design decisions regarding long term performance in any new or modified part.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project entails increasing the ability of commercial users of mass spectrometry to bring better products to market through the use of technology that better molecular identification and quantification. Commercial users of mass spectrometry include pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology firms, and other companies that have a direct impact on public health and wellbeing and are currently limited in social impact and revenue, in part, due to the inability to accurately identify and quantify molecules in mass spectrometry samples.  Specific applications for the technology includes research and development on a variety of products, including diagnostic tests, novel drugs, and personalized medicine.

    This I-Corps project will investigate the commercial delivery of mass spectrometry data processing services. The underlying technology advances current capabilities by combining advanced statistical methods, additional information present in mass spectrometry signals but not used by current approaches, and novel methods for interpretation to identify more molecules than current mass spectrometry approaches with more quantitative accuracy than current approaches. The research is particularly capable of detecting low abundance molecules, which are exceptionally difficult to detect with current methods, and are more likely to have biological significance than high abundance molecules. Corporate mass spectrometry users can use accurate identifications and quantifications of low abundance molecules to shorten time-to-market, reduce development costs, and increase the production throughput and significance of innovations across a broad spectrum of pharmaceutical and biotechnology products.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to provide K-12 schools with a learning environment, curriculum, and teacher training to expand and improve computer science education and to encourage a diverse student population to pursue further studies in computing. Computer science has become a core 21st century skill critical to careers both within and beyond the tech industry, but K-12 education has yet to meet increasing demand from industry and from parents to teach computing, and school districts still struggle to adequately train teachers and to engage students in computer science. This project provides a simple and easy-to-use solution that integrates music with computer science to drive student engagement. Moreover, this approach contributes to a diverse computer science pipeline by engaging female and minority students through an emphasis on creativity and real-world applications. Today there is a market for schools to train teachers, and to buy materials and tools to teach computer science.

    This I-Corps project leverages an online learning environment, curriculum, and teacher training designed for any introductory computing course from late elementary through to the college level, along with a body of research assessing the effects of this learning intervention on student content knowledge and engagement in computing. The web-based learning platform includes a code editor, a multi-track audio player, an audio loop library, an interactive textbook, and mechanisms for students to share and collaborate, along with curricular, training, and grading tools for teachers. Mixed-methods research has shown significant student gains in both content knowledge and engagement across gender and demographic groups when learning with this approach, with particularly large gains in engagement for female students. Students ascribe their increased engagement in computing to the creative, expressive, and real-world approach of the intervention through its combination of popular music and music production techniques with computational thinking and programming in industry-relevant coding languages.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to develop a platform for facilitated deployment of interactive automated messaging services called chatbots, that can be configured by non-technical personnel. There is a broad community consensus that the chatbots have become one of the recent major mobile application trends. Chatbots are computer programs designed to simulate conversations with human users, especially over various messaging channels including plain texting and instant messaging over the Internet. There exists a need in developing platforms to facilitate chatbots deployments for broader use. The innovation can be useful to any business which has many customers and can save communication resources by delegating routine conversations to an automated interactive messaging system. The potential commercial impact of this tool will be significant for both saving time and money by reducing administrative burdens.

    This I-Corps project will explore commercial feasibility of a flexible generic chatbot service which can be programmed, operated and managed by non-technical personnel for fast and inexpensive deployments. By using dedicated menus, the system operators will program their protocols by adding user-specific variables, uploading messages and their triggering/scheduling conditions, setting messaging channels, linking to external data sources and destinations. The proposed system will automatically integrate all the messages and their triggering conditions in a conflict-free protocol flow on the background and will allow the operator to check and observe the protocol execution flow in time by simulation. The proof-of-concept prototype is already used in two health-promotion projects and the team members gain valuable experience. This approach provides more flexibility and conditioned cycling options than existing solutions.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is
    to improve safety and minimize equipment maintenance costs. In healthcare, equipment
    malfunctions are a major patient safety issue because of direct patient care impact,
    and also due to equipment maintenance costs in general. The technology developed
    here monitors the health of biomedical equipment asset with the purpose of predicting,
    in real-time, biomedical equipment asset failure in order to reduce the rate of
    equipment failure, thereby, improving safety and reducing costs. This project
    will equip healthcare and military facilities with a tool to better manage their
    assets, eradicate equipment downtime, reduce maintenance cost and eliminate unanticipated
    failures. The added benefit of the commercial potential of this project comes
    from the opportunity for Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) of equipment
    assets to improve their technologies with the condition-based maintenance strategy
    that this innovation offers. \n\nThis I-Corps project seeks to develop a low-cost,
    power-efficient, wireless, mesh-networked family of microprocessors, sensors and
    software designed to give real-time reporting on equipment status and offer condition-based
    maintenance schedules. The instrumentation innovation is the combination of different
    sensors to capture periodic data on pressure, temperature, humidity, position,
    current and vibration on an equipment asset for condition-based maintenance of
    the asset. This project will be based on the Internet of Things (IoT) in the connection
    and management of different assets in a healthcare facility or military materiel
    supply chain. This project will develop a template for the integration of mesh
    radio frequency identification (RFID) of emitted but encrypted radio frequency
    (RF) signals in conformance to IEEE 802.15.4 standards over the 2.4 GHz industrial,
    scientific, and medical (ISM) radio band. The device will be used in conjunction
    with the cloud where data will be processed in a wireless configuration. Coupled
    with the development of this module is a dynamic data analytic procedure that
    incorporates novel machine learning statistical routines for maintenance forecasts."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is in the displacement of many battery applications with an alternative technology based on a Thin Flexible Fuel Cell (TFFC). Initial target markets include the many applications in which long-life, compactness and high performance are important. Based on the needs for portable storage filled by batteries at present, a technology that increases lifetimes between charging by ten times will impact multiple applications including smartphones, tablets, test equipment, medical instruments, and small autonomous vehicles.  The result will be greater flexibility and versatility imparted to the various systems impacted, and greater utility and benefit to their users.

    This I-Corps project leverages a recent discovery in hydrogen fuel cell technology, the Thin Flexible Fuel Cell (TFFC). The structural components of the TFFC are constructed completely from soft materials, rather than rigid and more dense metals, plastics or composites. The result is that the device is ultra-thin (< 1 mm), sheet-like, and may be bent into almost any arbitrary shape. It is also extremely light and has among the highest recorded power densities on a mass or volume basis for compact, air-breathing, fuel cells.  The fuel cell was discovered through research on the implementation of low-cost two-dimensional device fabrication involving nano-imprint lithography. The device was found to have five times the power density (W/kg) of state-of-the-art commercially available ultra-light, compact fuel cells. Moreover, the TFFC is completely passive with respect to oxygen supply and thermal management, needing no extra sub-systems for these functions.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is creating computer-aided classification methods to better identify and distinguish various diseases. Skin issues are the most frequently addressed issues presented in primary care: over one-third of primary care visits include at least one skin problem. Skin issues are visual manifestations of many different types of diseases, including allergies, injuries, bacterial infections, viral infections, and hormonal fluctuations. A physician's ability to address skin issues is highly dependent on a physician's prior visual training experiences. However, many physicians are not regularly familiar with the over 2,000 dermatology issues that can arise in a patient. The algorithms developed here allow for objective and much more accurate screening of exposed skin to improve evaluation of patient issues in many different care settings. This could be implemented for many different types of skin diseases and other visual constructions of images to assist physicians visually and vastly augment their sensitivity and specificity at identifying dermatology issues and their underlying causes.

    This I-Corps project is based on using image processing and machine learning to distinguish dermatological diseases. Image-capturing electronics such as consumer-grade cameras and smartphones are becoming increasingly ubiquitous, capable, and affordable. Image processing and machine learning based on annotated images has shown great potential for algorithms to differentiate between images capturing different objects and patterns. The developments here have created a classification system that differentiates suspicious from non-suspicious lesions that is easy for a physician to use in a clinical setting to help with clinical decision-making. The proof of concept is based on a large dataset of prospective clinical images where the algorithms classified malignant cases and the methods resulted in a statistically significant discrimination between suspicious and non-suspicious lesions.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of the I-Corps project is the development of a prototype geodetic satellite-based gravity observational system and the associated cloud-based computing tools for the rapid remote monitoring of floods, droughts, and freshwater resources availability globally at basin scales. The project is expected to enable efficient, dynamic, big data quantifications of freshwater transport for a wide range of potential commercial applications. The potential commercialization of this tool and the timely availability of the associate data products could provide critical information and impact on commercial applications including precision agriculture, disaster planning and management, as well as general water resources management.

    This I-Corps project will explore the commercialization of a cloud-based satellite temporal gravity observation processing and visualization tool.  This is designed for rapid monitoring with up to daily temporal sampling for natural or anthropogenic features.  The project builds from prior developments improving the temporal resolution of water storage change and potentially improving its spatial resolution.  Current commercially available tools for agricultural and disaster/water resources management services are primarily based on passive remote sensing imaging which are typically limited by cloud cover or are prohibitively expensive for acquiring timely data sets.  As Earth satellite gravity mission data sets continue into the next decade, the data underpinning this work is freely available and potentially updated in near real time.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project stems from its data intelligence approach to empower electronic design automation. The semiconductor industry provides vital hardware backbone of the information technology age through an extremely wide range of integrated circuits (ICs) in computing devices and consumer electronics.  Modern IC development process is bottlenecked by growing chip design complexity, e.g. measured by large device count and functionality diversity, and ever-demanding requirements on computing performance and power/energy efficiency. Advanced IC manufacturing processes are costly, and yet have unavoidable process variations, making fabricated chips susceptible to failures. With its revenue reaching $7.8 billion in 2015, the electronic design automation (EDA) industry supplies indispensable tools and methodologies that make IC design possible. The potential market and societal impact of the proposed EDA innovation is substantial. This technology can help semiconductor and chip design companies develop integrated circuits of improved performance and robustness with a reduced time-to-market and development cost.

    This I-Corps project demonstrates novel machine learning algorithms targeting electronic design automation. As the complexity of integrated circuits scales up rapidly, the need for smart design tools is prominent. The EDA industry is in the early phase of rapid integration of machine learning algorithms into commercial IC design flows. The learning methods focused in this project significantly improve the accuracy of statistical regression and classification over the current-state-of-the-art, and offer the much needed understanding of the underlying structure of the data. Built upon the focused machine learning algorithms, the targeted EDA technology can efficiently process simulation or measured performance data of existing chip designs, and intelligently learn the complex hidden relationships between performance specifications, design parameters, and manufacturing conditions. As a result, it offers a powerful data science solution to IC design optimization, verification, and debug.   Implemented as high-performance parallel software design tools, the technology will bring the power of machine learning to the field of electronic design.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to transform health, wellness, and disease assessment and monitoring by developing a simple, cost-effective method of exhaled air analysis. This technology can be used in diverse scenarios, including in the hospital, primary care settings, in the field, and directly by the end-user. The long term potential impact of this technology is the ability to collect physiological measurements frequently, non-invasively, and deliver results instantaneously. Infrequent measurements or delays in diagnostic results can lead to avoidable morbidity, mortality, and direct emergency/terminal care costs. This technology is capable of addressing unmet monitoring and diagnostic needs in a wide variety of clinical and health & wellness applications, representing a multibillion dollar value creation opportunity impacting stakeholders throughout the value chain.

    This I-Corps project aims to develop a technology platform that will enable accurate and cost effective breath gas analysis at the point-of-care.  The breath test is made possible by carbon nanotube chemiresistor sensor scheme and device integration advancements. This project has a novel approach to selective detection of gases at part-per-billion concentrations using a smartphone and near field communication tags modified with a simple two-step process. The technology platform consists of a circuit design, data transfer method, fabrication process, and chemiresistor formulations to enable molecularly-specific detection of biomarkers at biologically relevant (part-per-billion) concentrations in exhaled breath.  This technology produces a chemically-specific, concentration-dependent electrical output without compromising on the pattern recognition benefits of 'electronic nose' solutions. This work may also yield general advancements in chemical sensor performance optimization and thin-film electronics roll-to-roll manufacturing techniques.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is focused on improving occupational safety for workers during the collection and transfer of potentially infectious or contaminated fluids such as umbilical cord blood or environmental water to test tubes for transportation to the laboratory. This fluid collection and transfer technology reduces fluid splash and splatter during fluid collection and eliminates the need for a needle and syringe system during transfer thereby eliminating haphazard and dangerous methods currently in use. These procedures are thereby rendered safer by reducing the risk of potentially infectious fluid exposures and by reducing the risk of needle stick injuries. There is considerable commercial opportunity due to the intensity of interest in improving the occupational safety of staff and personnel involved in the large number of fluid collection and transfer procedures taking place daily.

    This I-Corps project proposes to develop an inexpensive and safe technology for collecting and transferring potentially infectious or contaminated fluids to test tubes. The system consists of a collection vessel with a wide opening to easily collect fluids from various sources and a guide tube assembly (consisting of a guide tube with a recessed needle installed) which is clipped into to the vessel. Laboratory tubes are filled with fluid in the vessel in a clean, quick, efficient and safe manner by inserting the laboratory tube into the guide tube.  As a result, the worker can complete the procedure without the need for removing the stopper from the vacuum tube (reducing mess and contamination) and without the need for an exposed needle (reducing risk of percutaneous injury). This project is focused on workers involved in these commonplace fluid transfer procedures and the administrative staff concerned with protecting these workers and reducing liability (and cost) for their institutions.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is catalyzing the shift from mobile to spatial computing through enabling Augmented Reality (AR) technology.  AR has a broad impact across many use cases such as instruction, visualization, and entertainment.  AR offers an intuitive visualization that decreases the cognitive overhead for the user, thus providing an environment with less manufacturing mistakes, better-visualized parts, or real-time data visualizations for example.  Such technology enhances the abilities of people by showing the relevant information when it is needed to the user. This context-aware visualization tool offers a personalized experience in a way that brings digital content into the physical world in an intuitive, spatially consistent manner. This growing new technology has the potential to change how people interact with digital content in the physical world.

    This I-Corps project addresses the problem of estimating a partially observable three-dimensional manifold in conjunction with a full 6-degree of freedom pose from inertial measurements and sequential two-dimensional luminescent representations of semi-static observations - a fundamental problem for Augmented Reality (AR).  Inertial observations alone provide minimal uncertainty for up to a tenth of a second using commercially available and ubiquitous hardware, thus limiting the accuracy pose estimation and, for practical long-term applications, necessitating visual input to be jointly fused in.  This project focuses on ubiquitous handheld computing platforms, inducing resource constraint considerations for both accuracy and human interface experiences.  Further computational considerations need to be made for enabling parallel application-specific processes, thus further limiting available resources.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is in fabrication of improved structures for use in harsh environments. The core technology was originally developed for inexpensive heat shields for space vehicles.  It can now be used for complex heat exchangers or for hot-section components for aviation and power generation engines, or for radiation resistant liners in nuclear applications. In all these applications, the proposed technology can reduce the original equipment cost while improving performance and reliability, or can be used to reduce replacements cost of original metal-based components. When applied to aviation or power generation, the net benefit can in the form of lower emissions from the engines, and lower cost of flying or lower electricity cost due to both lower fuel cost and lower maintenance cost. As the underlying manufacturing technology has significant overlap with that for polymer composite structures such as boat hulls or wind turbines, manufacturing personnel employed in such traditional industries can be easily retrained for manufacturing of high-value added, hot-section components for capital goods such as gas turbine engines for aviation and power generation.

    This I-Corps Project focuses on potential applications of a relatively new type of high-temperature structural materials, known as Polymer Derived Ceramic Composite (PDCC). PDCC fabrication is inexpensive as it involves similar fabrication techniques as other polymer composite structures like wind turbine blades or boat hulls. However, ceramic fiber and special resin are to be used for PDCC. Currently available resin-fiber combinations offer maximum use temperatures between 1200C and 1700C, depending on the choice of ceramic fibers. This maximum use temperature is much higher than creep-onset temperatures of common high-temperature alloys.  The PDCC process is significantly less inexpensive compared to many monolithic ceramics or alternative ceramic matrix composite processes.  Also, use of appropriate molds during formation of the polymeric state can lead to relatively complex shapes. PDCC?s share the typical properties of other ceramics, such as corrosion resistance or radiation tolerance.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to improve overall health through on-body biomedical monitoring.  Although this study focuses on a wearable textile material for use specifically in cutaneous sensing applications, these same materials will have broader implications for public health since they can be used for a variety of sensing or device applications.  The materials developed in this work could be functionalized for the detection of a wide variety of biomarkers and such innovations could profoundly impact our ability to diagnosis, treat, and prevent diseases, from analysis of common diabetic neurological complications to the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis (CF).  These materials could also be used in smart clothing to allow for biomonitoring in advanced prosthetic limb applications, bedridden patients, or athlete performance tracking. Development of a wearable sensing material capable of determining physiological parameters at the surface of skin could also make construction of health monitoring sensor arrays relatively easy and inexpensive.

    This I-Corps project is based on innovative, textile-based sensing materials capable of continuous monitoring of biomarkers in sweat, which could have significant impact on the field of biomedical monitoring.  These sensing materials would be better than current sensors as they could provide continuous information about a person's health based on a molecular level analysis of sweat biomarkers in a flexible, lightweight device that could be worn in any application without discomfort.  This technology can provide reliable, real-time monitoring of dehydration (sodium ions), muscle fatigue (lactic acid), and temperature in cutaneous sweat.  These sensors are made of functionalized carbon nanotube nanocomposites with an electrospun polymer base.  One sensor, using a polypyrrole functionalization, has been demonstrated to measure temperature in a physiologically relevant range (25-45 degrees Celsius).  Selective nanocomposite materials functionalized with calixarene can selectively measure sodium ions in synthetic sweat, without ionic interference; while, nanocomposite materials functionalized with lactate oxidase have been demonstrated to selectively measure lactic acid without glucose interference.  The data collected from the developed sensor could lead to better understanding of health and disease processes, leading to better treatments and health outcomes for all patients.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to provide technologies and services based on models of speech signals and human speech perception. These models incorporate a deep understanding of the physical speech stimulus and the perceptual representations that drive speech perception.  Technology applications to be explored can break new ground in areas such as: (1) Improving the efficacy of audiological testing; (2) Improving the realism of computer-synthesized voices (3) Providing speech perception training for better understanding of non-native speakers or speakers with neurological disorders; (4) Enhancing multisensory speech perception through training of individuals with audiovisual speech processing deficits such as individuals on the autism spectrum; (5) Developing sensory substitution or augmentation through vibrotactile stimuli; and (6) Improving the quality of older adults? lives through visual speech perception training to ameliorate their declines in perceiving auditory speech in noisy backgrounds.

    This I-Corps project will investigate commercial applications of technologies and services based on models of multisensory speech signals and human speech perception.  Human speech perception can be highly errorful in the presence of noise and/or distortions that originate in the talker, the physical communication channel, and/or the perceiver (e.g., hearing loss). The technology to be explored models how speech perception degrades, and how multisensory stimuli compensate for perceptual errors. For example, this technology supports the characterization of speech perception difficulties using a simple talk-back task in which the perceiver repeats what was just said. In formal laboratory experiments, this technology has been used to improve speech perception training outcomes through improvements in the contingencies between perceptual errors and training feedback. This technology can be used in developing media that are designed to reduce the potential for perceptual errors.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project can widely affect the implementation of photovoltaics, by significantly reducing the cost without compromising on device performance. The low temperature silver reactive inks are projected to use 90 percent less silver than traditional screen-printing technologies. Additionally the low temperature process will use significantly less energy and utilize equipment with relatively low capital expenditures requirements and high throughputs. This technique is of particular importance to temperature sensitive devices and substrates, not only because the reactive inks do not require firing but also because low temperature screen printing silver paste are costly, even more so than their high temperature counterparts. Thus the path envisioned for this technology not only can radically change the cost structure of solar cells but it also has the potential of affecting other markets such as wearable electronics, flexible displays and building integrated devices.

    This I-Corps project further develops findings in the field of evaporation-confined adhesion promotion and reactive ink chemistry. It is based on application of reactive inks to photovoltaics, optimization of adhesion pretreatments, and understanding of printing and drying kinetics of the multiple chemical solutions involved in the process. It has been demonstrated that the process can reduce silver consumption by an order of magnitude and obtain comparable high efficiency to a screen-printed heterojuntion device. It has been further demonstrated that the reactive silver metallization is compatible with the state-of-the-art smart wiring technology for module assembly, reducing the silver consumption even further. It has also been shown that the reactive ink printed modules can withstand damp heat accelerated testing without any signs of performance loses, corrosion or delamination of the modules.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to treat an enormous healthcare danger, infections caused by drug resistance bacteria. The serious threat of drug resistant bacteria, including E. coli, MRSA and K. pneumonia, jeopardizes the health and wellbeing on a global population. Achievement of this development as well as commercializing the product will provide an effective way of delivering therapeutics to multidrug resistant bacteria infections, improving the life quality of patients worldwide. Global healthcare will be greatly improved, benefiting society and saving lives of many patients who currently suffer from drug resistant bacteria.

    This I-Corps project will produce an effective antibacterial drug delivery platform to combat multidrug resistant bacterial infections. Although numerous antimicrobial drugs have been developed with therapeutic efficacy, inefficient delivery is a significant issue due to the antibiotic resistance. An innovative nanomedicine approach is created to encapsulate current antimicrobial drugs in targeted nanoparticles to efficiently delivery drugs and combat the antibiotic resistance. This advanced technology will not only improve healthcare, but also enhance scientific and technological understanding of nanoparticle drug delivery systems in treating antibiotic resistance bacteria infections. This drug delivery system has great potential to advance knowledge as it may be altered to treat many other illnesses if successful.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is a significant increase in the efficiency of hospital procedure scheduling.  The project analyzes the sources of inefficiencies in the planning, staffing, coordination, and execution of the various phases of surgeries and associated procedures.  Preliminary analysis of hospital data shows that the throughput of surgical units can be increased significantly with the same staffing while reducing the delays and improving the working conditions of the personnel. Delays in obtaining and communicating updates on the status of surgeries and on actions that personnel should perform are major causes of inefficiency, as is the randomness of the duration of tasks. We expect the methodology to be widely applicable to the coordination of teams in services and transportation industries.

    This I-Corps project is based on a machine learning approach to the optimization of real-time messaging tuned using actual hospital data. The technical novelty is a formulation of the real-time policies that incorporates the messages between the main actors and enables the use of machine learning to optimize the policies.  The approach combines new parametric models of real-time scheduling, stochastic gradient descent, and infinitesimal perturbation analysis. In this formulation, perturbation analysis computes the gradient of the objective function with respect to the timing of messages and results in an efficient algorithm.  The algorithm discovers the best time to send messages to optimize a combination of operating room efficiency and patient waiting times.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will be in the modernization of the electrical power grid and solving the challenges of integrating large scale renewable sources to the grid while improving the reliability, resilience, affordability, and flexibility of the electric power grid. This project's hardware/software controller turns the battery energy storage system from a passive component in the grid to an active and smart component which is able to benefit both grid operators and customers automatically. This technology will benefit utilities and independent system operators through providing enhanced grid services and reducing investment cost of system expansion. The commercial potential of this technology is due to its capabilities for improving power quality, increasing power system reliability, decreasing green gas emission, reducing peak demand, and maximizing renewable energy utilization. This technology will also benefit commercial, residential, and industrial customers by potentially reducing their electricity bill, increasing power reliability, and providing them with revenue in the energy market. The end product is a software/hardware controller panel which will be integrated with a battery energy storage system consisting of battery modules, inverter and measurement devices.

    This I-Corps project involves a real time hardware/software controller for smart operation of Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) in the grid. The developed technology incorporates a novel control algorithm/structure in the form of an integrated hardware/software device, to control the power flow of BESS. The control hardware is configured for effective interaction of the controller with inverter, battery management system, and measurement units. The control software is structured to manage the communication, safe operation and monitoring of the system. This product, by employing control, machine learning, discrete signal processing, and optimization methods, enables BESS as a buffer to dynamically compensate for the renewable intermittency and load uncertainty in the power grid. The main advantage of the controller is to minimize the size of allocated battery for applications such as voltage regulation, renewable compensation, and load compensation.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will lead to the adoption of a low cost, accurate, water hardness sensor that will drive a substantial reduction in the amount of salt released into municipal sewer systems as well as reducing water waste. Softeners are regenerated with sodium chloride brine, which is usually discarded into the sewer and causes excess salinity in rivers. Some communities have restricted or banned water softeners because of this brine discharge. The incorporation of a hardness sensor on the water softener?s treated outlet would allow for complete utilization of the water softener?s capacity. Additionally, the sensor would provide a visual indication of the water softener performance. The sensor is more robust, less complex and less expensive than any other hardness sensor reported in the patent or technical literature.

    This I-Corps project will advance the state of the art of water softening by providing a means of detecting precisely when a salt-regenerated water softener needs regeneration. The hardness sensor detects hardness ions (e.g. calcium) by detection of a change in electrical resistance of an elongated cation-exchange material (membrane or fiber), in contact with water. The first sensors used a membrane between two plates. The newer sensors use cation exchange fibers, which provide substantially faster response. The new hardness sensor offers major advantages over the existing hardness probes available in the market. The sensor will be able to optimize softener operation, which will ensure soft water is being provided while also minimizing the environmental impact. While the immediate impact of the hardness sensor is a novel way of detecting when a water softener needs regeneration, the sensor design is expected to have applications beyond hardness monitoring. For example, the sensor can be modified to be employed in nitrate removal systems.

This project's new generation conductive polymer wire is durable, strong, light, and easy to manufacture cost-effectively. The new wire  is seen as a potential replacement for copper, which is heavy and a commodity subject to significant price instabilities.  This new technology could be disruptive in electric power industry. Lighter electronic devices will also be possible through this technology that could impact everything from portable devices to a reduction of the weight of automobiles and aircrafts. It also has the potential to revolutionize the current conductive polymer market.

    This I-Corps project proposes a technology that may replace copper in electric power distribution and transmission. The proposed technology is based on a newly discovered carbon-based polymer with excellent electrical conductivity comparable to that of copper. This new material is durable, light, strong, and highly conductive with a high melting point over 1000C. Electric wires and cables can be easily manufactured cost effectively using the powder-in-tube technique with a copper sheath. Feasibility assessment requires exploration into fabrication of flexible wires for easy installation and handling and for good connectivity with copper wires, as well as exploring the potential customer base for this technology.

    on scaling and sustaining of an educational innovation, nScope, one of the centerpieces
    in the parent NSF project funded under the \"Engaged Student Learning\" track
    in the IUSE: EHR program. The nScope system is a USB-powered device that plugs
    into an electronics prototyping breadboard. The nScope is equipped with an oscilloscope,
    power supply, two function generators and two pulse generators. The hardware is
    accompanied by a graphical interface and an open application program interface
    (API) for custom control from any platform - PC, Mac, and Raspberry Pi. The current
    version is easy and safe for beginners, yet powerful enough for experts. The versatility
    makes nScope a potent educational tool for all types of  STEM learners.  This
    I-Corps for Learning project will investigate ways to increase the impact of this
    innovative project so that more STEM students can benefit from the capabilities
    of nScope. Possible paths to be explored include partnerships and collaborations
    with universities, community colleges, and engineering licensure boards. Tutorials
    or modules will be tailored to the user needs. The scaling of the innovation will
    investigate means of sustaining the project including potential commercial outlets.
    \n\nResearch has established that the learner-centered, knowledge-centered, assessment-centered,
    and community-centered aspects of a course enhance student learning. Aspects of
    hardware improvement, tutorial development, learning module customization, and
    the way that the users interact with the products play roles in whether the education
    innovation embodies principles of effective learning. Broader adoption outside
    the classroom where end users are much more diverse provides an opportunity to
    consider more demographic factors in assessing the education innovation and in
    designing materials that take those factors into account. The customizable features
    and low cost of nScope have the potential to make some types of STEM instruction
    more interactive and effective for a variety of students.  The project will help
    advance knowledge regarding how to support successful adaptation of experiential
    modules across different curricula, multiple engineering disciplines, and a range
    of institutional cultures."

    Supercomputers enable researchers to push the boundaries of science and find innovative approaches to complex problems. From improving advanced manufacturing with modeling and simulation to understanding earth systems and weather with greater precision, harnessing the data revolution and applying data to understand life processes, supercomputers are essential to human advancement.  HPC (High Performing Computer) systems of the future will likely be very different from those of today. Emerging architectures can have a tremendous impact on the development of software, methods and models that can take advantage of these new features resulting in speed up and improvement in the accuracy of calculations. Early adoption of these emerging technologies to take advantage of special features is key to remaining competitive in the global economy. The goal of this IRES site is to engage PhD. students in research learning experiences that increase their capacity to conduct research on supercomputing systems, (including those with classical and emerging architectures), and their exposure to international collaborative research.

    This IRES, called ASSURE, aims to enhance the capabilities of US graduate students to develop Algorithms and Software in key scientific disciplines that benefit from Supercomputers and emerging aRchitEctures (ASSURE). The program focuses on equipping students to conduct research on one of the fastest supercomputers in the world, Sunway Taihulight, housed in Wuxi China, which has a unique architecture. ASSURE achieves this goal by: (i) training students to utilize unique international large-scale systems; (ii) engaging students in high quality collaborative research in four key areas of computational and data science utilizing these systems; and (iii) exposing students to international large-scale research environments that prepare them with cultural and professional skills required to occupy international leadership roles. Specifically, IRES students at this site will conduct research at two locations in China: The National Supercomputing Center (NSCC) in Wuxi China and the University of Tsinghua and the East China Normal University.

    The ASSURE site is open to US Ph.D. students with an interest in computational and data science in the areas of earth systems, drug design, advanced manufacturing, big data and machine learning. Specifically, US citizens or permanent residents, including women and students from underrepresented populations in international STEM research, are invited to participate.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is a novel prosthesis that addresses many health concerns addressed by the more than 600,000 individuals in the lower limb amputee population. The amputee population exhibits many day-to-day challenges associated with mobility tasks such as descending stairs, or even level ground walking. This projects seeks to develop an ankle prosthesis that addresses many of these needs while maintaining a small, quiet, and lightweight package. No other prosthesis on the commercial market exhibits the same functionality as this device, and therefore, there exists a gap in the market that can be filled by this device.

    This I-Corps project is based on a novel ankle prosthesis, utilizing a novel actuator. This novel actuator allows this device to exhibit the following three mechanical functions: 1) high torque locking under load; 2) high-power dissipation under load; and 3) low-power generation in the absence of a load. These functions allow amputees to adapt to various terrains, gain support during standing, perform stair descent like healthy subjects as well as lift their toe during swing to avoid tripping. A prototype device has been created, and is to be assessed on amputees to determine its biomechanical benefit.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

- abstractText: "This I-Corps Site at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) will
    increase the quality and quantity of commercializable student projects, leveraging
    its core strengths in diversity and experiential learning to advance innovation,
    entrepreneurship, and commercialization outcomes. \n\nRIT has a track record for
    innovation. The Simone Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship's Student Incubator
    advanced approximately 100 multidisciplinary teams during 2012. These teams are
    supported by the Simone Center's faculty Innovation Council with representatives
    from all of RIT's colleges. Funding from the NSF I-Corp program will expand the
    number of teams that will receive funding for prototyping/proof of concepts supplies,
    coach expense, and exploratory customer market activities. The Simones Center's
    approach to entrepreneurship is experiential and multidisciplinary. RIT is situated
    to pioneer an I-Corps Site because of its history with experiential learning (coop,
    industry relationships, history of practitioners in the classroom etc.) and its
    program diversity. The Simone Center programs integrate technology, design, and
    business perspectives in a holistic manner. Teams simultaneously enter a program
    with formalized training and curriculum and weekly coaching by an experienced
    cohort of industry-based entrepreneurs and product developers. \n\nThis proposal
    provides broader impacts to society and Rochester region in several ways:\n-The
    Creation of Entrepreneurial Assets: RIT will increase the number of graduates
    with an emphasis on STEM and design with business creation/tech commercialization
    knowledge, experience, and teams building skills to innovate throughout their
    careers.\n-New Ventures: The Student Incubator has and will continue to create
    a variety of companies that have growth and provided economic development to the
    struggling Rochester Region. \n-Pipeline Development: RIT will provide a pre-seed/early
    stage pipeline for potential new ventures.  \n-Successful Undergraduate Innovation
    Processes: This program promotes and advances the development of balanced student
    teams, experienced coaching, and access to university support services (prototyping
    labs, faculties, and other expertise). \n-Integration with a Preexisting Business
    Incubator: The Simone Center's programs and events target early stage business
    development. The Simone Center's Student Incubator Program transitions its investment
    ready projects/businesses to the pre-existing RIT Incubator allows each unit to
    focus on the a specific stage of new venture creation. This is also a potential
    process for learning and dissemination.\nThis is a project at an institution that
    serves a very large population of deaf students (the largest population in the
    nation). It has processes in place that will accommodate those and the other RIT
    students to explore entrepreneurship and innovation - 90% of all RIT students
    engage in a co-op experience. The Site design is student-centric, having the joint
    impact of launching innovative products and immersing students in an entrepreneurship
    curriculum. RIT has a track record of successes - in particular, they have a history
    of launching \"game-centric\" and visual media products.\n\n\nThe Site has the
    potential to have a large regional impact in a part of the country that has been
    economically depressed. There is a large team of volunteers willing to mentor
    students as well as an Advisory Board to guide the programs."

  title: Enhancing the Technology and Design Entrepreneurship and Innovation Ecosystem
    at Rochester Institute of Technology
- abstractText: |-
    This project will enable cohorts of students from engineering, anthropology, and other sustainability-related disciplines to collaborate and study the efficacy of sanitation and wastewater treatment technologies as well as the role of culture and local perceptions on the safe recovery of energy, nutrients, and clean water from human excreta and wastewater. Over the course of three years, a total of 18 US students will be supported to study the performance of different technologies at the Center for Research and Training in Sanitation (CePTS) in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. This facility, which is co-managed by the Federal University of Minas Gerais and the State Wastewater Company of Minas Gerais, contains pilot-scale reactors that treat real wastewater from the city of Belo Horizonte. Considered one of the most important research and professional training centers of its kind in the Americas, it is used as a test site to evaluate the effectiveness of new technologies and train wastewater system operators. In addition to broadening students' perspectives about sanitation, resource recovery, and risk within an interdisciplinary team setting, this project will also allow students to improve their intercultural abilities. The researchers will seek to recruit students that reflect our demographics as Title V Hispanic Serving Institutions, with a particular focus on underrepresented groups in the sciences and engineering. Students will participate in a five-day intensive crash course on Brazilian culture and Portuguese language, led by the San Diego State University Program on Brazil, where they will learn to articulate the opinions and perspectives of people from different cultures and backgrounds. They will gain an awareness of international, interdisciplinary, and community perspectives on the role of engineering and technology in the management of water, energy, and food systems. After participating in the research experience, students will share their experiences by engaging in local outreach activities at K-12 schools in Southern California.

    The integration of water reuse and resource recovery into wastewater treatment and sanitation systems provides opportunities to simultaneously meet several of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. However, the challenges of choosing appropriate and sustainable technologies are just as much social as they are technical. Inadequate assumptions about local attitudes and the role of technology in development can lead to the failure of systems. Thus, there is a need to integrate studies of the efficacy of sanitation and resource recovery technologies with assessments of social and cultural factors that influence perceptions about these technologies, as well as the perceived value and risk of recovering resources from wastewater and excreta. This three-year International Research Experience for Students (IRES) project will send interdisciplinary cohorts of six students each year (from Engineering, Anthropology and an interdisciplinary Sustainability Program) to Belo Horizonte, Brazil, to participate in a research experience with foreign mentorship at the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG). Students will study the removal of emerging contaminants and characterize the risks associated with resource recovery from pilot-scale established and emerging wastewater treatment technologies at the Center for Research and Training in Sanitation (CePTS), which is co-managed by UFMG and the State Wastewater Company of Minas Gerais. Students will also investigate perceived values and risks through ethnographic research with community members and local stakeholders in the water and wastewater sector. The results of this research will support a new and growing field of interdisciplinary scientific literature on the topic of water, culture, and sustainability.

    IRES project will support US students and provide international education, training
    and research in marine geochemistry and carbon cycling in a tropical estuary (Douala
    Estuary) in the Atlantic coast of Cameroon, West Africa. During this study, faculty
    and students from the University of Delaware, a PhD granting institution and Fort
    Hays State University, a non-PhD granting institution will partner with faculty
    and students from the University of Douala and the University of Yaound? 1in Cameroon.
    Over the next three years, 9 undergraduates and 3 MS students will travel to Cameroon
    to conduct hands-on, field-based research that is focused on investigating the
    effects of agriculture, urbanization, industrial and shipping activities on carbon
    cycling in the Douala Estuary. The objectives are to (1) document pollution in
    the water column and sediments and (2) assess if and how the human activities
    and pollution affect carbon dioxide production in water column and sediments.
    Data acquired by the students will provide important information to assess the
    role of the Douala Estuary in carbon cycling and provide valuable information
    to model the movement of carbon at the local, regional and even global scale.\n\nThis
    IRES project will provide undergraduate and graduate students with the opportunity
    to conduct faculty mentored, hands-on research in an apprenticeship-type model.
    Different aspects of the project will form the basis of undergraduate research

    carbon cycle. The US Carbon Cycle Research Program identified carbon contributions
    from estuaries to the atmosphere as a critical area for research. Much research
    on carbon cycling has been conducted in estuaries in temperate regions. To date,
    there are no studies of carbon cycling in tropical estuaries of Africa and even
    less is known about how agriculture, urbanization, industrial and shipping activities
    polluting theses estuaries affect the carbon cycle. Few estuarine studies are
    based in Africa, despite the high human population along the coast and extensive
    human alteration of estuarine ecosystems. The US Carbon Cycle Research Program
    identified carbon sources and fluxes to and from estuaries as a critical area
    for research because estuaries link the terrestrial, ocean and atmospheric carbon
    reservoirs. Yet, the role in local, regional or even global carbon cycling from
    tropical estuaries in sub-Saharan Africa which receive far greater amounts of
    organic carbon and pollutants compared to temperate and high latitude estuaries
    is unknown. To fill this knowledge gap, for six weeks and over a three-year period,
    US students and their Cameroonian peers will conduct field based research to elucidate
    how anthropogenic activities (agriculture, urbanization, industrial and shipping)
    that pollute the Douala Estuary with nutrients (e.g., nitrates) and metals (Cadmium)
    affect carbon cycling in the water column and sediments. The anticipated results
    of this project will provide important information to assess the role of the Douala
    Estuary in carbon cycling and provide valuable data for carbon cycling modelling
    at the local, regional and even global scale. Students will test the hypothesis
    that anthropogenic pollution in the Douala Estuary increases bio-productivity
    in the water column and sediments, alters the cycling of carbon and increases
    the flux of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. \n\nBy interacting with Cameroonian

    This IRES project is co-funded by OISE and EPSCoR.

    Twelve Native American students from five Tribal Colleges in the state of North Dakota will participate in a six-week summer program over the course of three years. Each year, four students will form a cohort and participate in pre-training in the U.S. and then visit and study at the host University in Beijing, China for five weeks. All three student cohorts will focus on one unifying topic - building and testing an Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled environmental monitoring system. During the course of the research training and after the project is finished, a deep and comprehensive evaluation will be conducted to assess three key aspects of the program: 1) instructional training and research experience, 2) global professional and cultural experience; and 3) student mentoring. This program will greatly benefit participating students. This is an international learning experience that may be the key highlight of student participants' academic careers, which may be especially true for Native American students, as they have less chances for performing research abroad. The program will provide participating students with unique opportunities to become globally-engaged scientists and to build their international scientific networks. There are five Tribal Colleges in the state of North Dakota that represent historic tribal nations. The recruitment of this program from these Tribal Colleges will ensure a regionally diverse student group will receive international mentoring and research-based education. In many large cities of U.S., there are environmental problems similar to Beijing, so the monitoring technology learned by participating students will provide valuable reference and an essential technology reserve. The participating students will build peer-mentoring skills and learn about the unique culture and traditions of China from Beijing, the culture center of China.

    Student participants will learn to design advanced environmental monitoring systems that integrate energy harvest and remote control, which can track all four categories of environmental contaminants including metals, radioisotopes, volatile organic contaminants, and biological contaminants. In this project, tasks for student participants include sensor developments, interface circuits designs, wireless sensor network designs for Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled systems to realize environmental monitoring, testing the proposed monitoring system on laboratory and field sites, and making reliability-based lifetime analyses. The proposed system is a much-needed technology for environmental decision-making that will help substantially reduce ecological and human-health threats from environmental problems, and the implemented prototype and test data will be a significant reference for the other academic researchers and industrial developers. Evaluation data collection will occur sequentially using a combination of qualitative and quantitative data measurements to assess the effectiveness of the program. The primary goals of this program are to: 1) provide students with training and mentoring in international-based engineering applications that will create a positive effect in their professional and personal lives, 2) create Native American experts in environmental monitoring and protection, and 3) improve specialized environmental management in the remote areas.

    The first stars, galaxies and black holes burst into existence only a few hundred million years after the Big Bang, bringing light to the cosmos and setting in motion processes that built the Universe as we see it today. Many mysteries remain about these early epochs, but not for too much longer: new and upcoming facilities such as the Atacama Large Millimeter Array and the James Webb Space Telescope are optimized to revolutionize our understanding of this time period, known as "Cosmic Dawn." The Cosmic Dawn Center of Excellence (DAWN, established 2018), an international research center in Copenhagen, Denmark, brings together scholars whose interests span a broad range of observational and theoretical inquiries into Cosmic Dawn. Their expertise, together with Copenhagen's beautiful and enriching setting, make DAWN an ideal host for budding US scholars. We will create the DAWN-IRES Scholars Program to empower future generations of US scientists through a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity of visiting Copenhagen to immerse themselves into this vibrant international research center. The DAWN-IRES scholars will join a cohort of 7 student researchers in a stimulating 10-week science program that merges research using next-generation telescopes with life in a thousand-year-old city. The program's structure will encourage students to build learning communities within their cohorts, equipping them with practical research and communication skills. At the same time, the international exposure and access to cutting-edge resources will help maintain US leadership within the global astronomical community.

    Students will lead observational and/or theoretical projects that contribute towards understanding some of the most fundamental questions in astrophysics today: What caused the reionization of the Universe?  How do the first, massive galaxies form?  What is the origin of galaxy scaling relations? What quenches star formation in massive galaxies?  Over the next decade, the center's mission is to develop and test a physical model explaining the key processes responsible for the assembly of the earliest galaxies through to the present day. The DAWN-IRES Scholars will join this thriving international research network, bridging the world class research performed by the US-based associate faculty coordinating this program with the DAWN permanent faculty and the local program coordinator.  The key learning goals of this international research experience include: (1) building a learning community to stimulate personal and academic growth, (2) developing effective scientific communication skills, and (3) performing globally competitive research addressing an open question in astrophysics.

    The DAWN-IRES program is primarily designed to enhance the progress of science through a unique global educational training experience for a diverse cohort of US students.  The themes defining the broader impact of the program include diversity, training, dissemination, and community.  Through extensive proactive recruitment strategies (direct contact with faculty at minority-serving institutions, leveraging social media, widely circulating flyers, local announcements in STEM courses, and more), the PI will assemble diverse groups of scholars to stimulate excellence and innovation.  The program incorporates a wide range of professional development activities that are focused on advancing scientific communication skills (e.g., weekly seminars, hack days, oral presentations abroad and stateside).  The students will also build professional research toolkits, including learning programming, data analysis and presentation techniques.  Dissemination of research will occur through the DAWN-IRES Scholars Symposium at the end of each summer in Copenhagen, together with a presentation at the students' local institutions and the national American Astronomical Society meeting.  Working with the Center for Excellence in Teaching at UConn, the assessment strategy of DAWN-IRES will be tailored to the learning goals of the program.

    Fungal infection of plants is an ongoing major threat to human agriculture, thus stressing the importance of the research proposed in this project. The fungal pathogens studied in the US lab of the PI and the two labs in Germany, serve as models for understanding basic mechanisms of infections, but also for understanding host specificity and emerging infectious disease through host shifts. It is expected to gain alternative perspectives to address these research themes by the collaborative approaches. This IRES project provides an opportunity to 7 students each year to participate in the exchange. Although all three labs work with fungi, each has its own areas of expertise and each provides different approaches for conducting research. Each summer, a joint meeting will take place with all participants and PIs to discuss and present the ongoing projects in a unified group setting, alternating each year in Bochum or in Aachen, Germany.  This project is of particular importance because it may lead to the development of new methods for protecting agricultural crop plants from fungal diseases. Also, this project will allow active participation by students and help them develop skills in experimental design, and broaden participation in basic science by underrepresented groups (especially, African-Americans, women, and Appalachian students).

    The unifying research theme for this proposal is host/pathogen interaction, including components of virulence and overall fitness of the pathogen. This project requires, and will benefit from, training in the two German labs, rather than having all students work in the same lab. First, the collaboration with two labs spreads the responsibility of the host labs and allows for more students (i.e., up to 7) to participate each year in the exchange. It is expected that the strong impact of these collaborative research/training exchanges will be in the longer-term appreciation of cultural differences and alternative approaches to research questions. The broader investigation of fungal/host interactions will benefit from this varied, collaborative approach by streamlining exchange of ideas and expertise. The proposed effector and protein interaction studies will be used by a wide community of scientists interested in basic fungal biology, host-parasite interactions, fungal evolution, and the development of new methods for protecting agricultural crop plants from fungal diseases and could lead to a better understanding of the basic infection mechanisms and disease process of obligate plant-parasitic fungi. Educational opportunities for students will be provided to actively participate in fungal genetics, transcriptomics and bio-informatics research, to learn fluorescence and electron microscopy techniques, to develop skills in experimental design, and will broaden the participation in basic science by underrepresented groups (specifically, African-Americans, women, and Appalachian students).

    Center for Selective Carbon - Hydrogen (C-H) Functionalization (CCHF) will coordinate and support a highly collaborative international exchange program with sites in Japan, South Korea and Germany. During the exchanges, students will participate in collaborative projects directed towards developing new approaches to making molecules in a streamlined and sustainable way. These new approaches will have impact on modern medicine and manufacturing, including drug discovery and materials science. This proposal builds upon a previous NSF Science Across Virtual Institutes (SAVI) program and provides the exciting opportunity to capitalize on the collaborative bonds already established to grow a truly diverse and globally prepared next generation of scientists that benefit from an integrated and successful global research collective. The overarching scientific theme that brings these international teams together is C-H functionalization, a science that is at the leading edge of academic chemical research.

    The aim of this International Research Experiences for Students (IRES) proposal is to establish a vibrant training environment for collaborative global research in the general field of C?H functionalization. This will be achieved by means of a productive international research collaborative, the Global Institute for C-H Functionalization (GICHF).  This program will involve student exchanges and collaborations between the CCHF and three major international centers in the general field of C-H functionalization.  These centers are the World Premier International Research Center Initiative (WPI)-funded Institute for Transformative Bio-Molecule (WPI-ITbM) at Nagoya University, Japan, the Institutes for Basic Sciences-funded Center for Catalytic Hydrocarbon Functionalizations (IBS-CF) at KAIST, South Korea, and the Photocatalysis Center based at the University of Regensburg, Germany.  Each year a cohort of CCHF students, consisting of 3 graduate and 5 undergraduate students will perform 8-12 week exchanges between May-August with the international partners. The CCHF will also host international students, funded by the international partners, to ensure reciprocity in the collaborative exchanges.  Programming throughout the year will be in place to prepare the students for the research exchanges and to ensure they make the most of these experiences. The experience will include a GICHF annual meeting, which will be hosted, on a rotating basis, at one of our international partners. The annual meeting will serve as an opportunity to bring together the entire student cohort as well as faculty from the United States, for a week-long brainstorming, community building, and educational event with our international partners.

    International Research and Professional Development Experience for Students on the Ecology and Conservation of Wildlife in Nosy Be, Madagascar

    The proposed research and professional development program will take place in Madagascar, one of the highest priority biodiversity hotspots in the world, with levels of endemism unmatched by any other country. The research goal of this program is to characterize the status of Nosy Be Island's endangered and charismatic terrestrial and marine species and identify the threats driving their declines. The research team of local and international researchers will train undergraduate students from the US and Madagascar to use a variety of wildlife research methods and social science surveys. Using these acquired skills, students will generate critical data on the conservation status of endangered marine and terrestrial species, including primates (lemurs), sea turtles, and dolphins. During this 3-year project students will, along with mentor, develop an understanding of the drivers of wildlife declines and design sustainable programs to protect them.  Science-based management is particularly important in Madagascar because terrestrial and marine ecosystems are experiencing alarming rates of biodiversity loss and habitat destruction in the face of food security challenges to local human populations. This project will create opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students from both countries to adapt field methods to research questions in the context of generating cost-effective data to achieve sustainable conservation goals. Most importantly, this program will produce cohorts of highly trained scientists in the field of conservation biology with a deep understanding of real-world challenges.

    Generating baseline ecological data on rare and charismatic endangered species is critical for conservation and wildlife management, particularly in data-poor areas where conflicts between human activities and biodiversity are acute. All research projects will address at least one of three objectives: (1) assess the critical habitats and density trends of six endangered flagship species, including three lemurs, one species of cetacean and one species of sea turtle, (2) investigate the environmental drivers of their abundance and their decline, and (3) assess the impact of potential mitigation measures. Each cohort of students (6 students per year) will base their research questions on the findings of previous cohorts, enabling us to develop a comprehensive understanding of the causes of decline and measures to preserve Nosy Be's wildlife. This research and professional development program has four stages: 1) pre-field training at Florida International University, 2) data collection in Madagascar, 3) data-analysis and reporting at FIU and 4) future-cohort input and supervision where students will share their experiences and support new cohorts. During field activities, students will be trained to 1) use standard methods to rapidly assess the conservation status of endangered species in the field and 2) use a combination of field and social science survey methods to conduct animal assessments. During class activities students will be trained to 1) write research proposals and field protocols, 2) use advanced statistical methods to analyze field data, 3) write technical and non-technical publications, 4) do oral presentations of their research, and 5) collaborate and mentor other students. Ultimately, this research program will provide critical data on the conservation status of endangered marine and terrestrial wildlife in Nosy Be, Madagascar, and will provide students with key research and conservation skills.

    and education partnership between the University of Michigan (U-M) and University
    of Bologna (UniBo) in Italy.  The proposed work is envisioned to improve the quality-of-life
    of people with disabilities and their caregivers, transform the knee-ankle-foot-orthosis
    care to data-based diagnosis and model-based design and 3D-printing, and provide
    an international research experience to students. The goal of this collaboration
    is to provide a high-quality international research experience to University of
    Michigan students to increase student diversity and retention and advance students'
    ability in and knowledge of culture, globalization, leadership, teamwork, and
    communication. The key intellectual merit of this collaboration is in the model-based
    design, 3D-printing, and evaluation of individualized assistive devices. The project
    will utilize technical knowledge gained from University of Michigan and will improve
    individualized assistive devices such as the knee-ankle-foot orthosis, a brace
    that helps people with leg instabilities to walk. \n\nThe scientific objective
    of this award is to establish an international research and education partnership
    between the University of Michigan (U-M) and University of Bologna (UniBo) in
    Italy on the model-based design, 3D-printing, and evaluation of individualized
    assistive devices (IADs). The project is focused on the advancements in 3D-printing
    and wearable sensors that enable the design and fabrication of assistive devices
    for individual needs.  Patient-specific biomechanical models will be developed
    to analyze the motions and forces associated with the daily activities of a patient.
    For example, from models of patient-specific knee joint motion, compliant 3D-printed
    knee joints will be analyzed and designed to improve the function of individual
    assistive devices.  Combined metal 3D-printing, precision machining, and mechanical
    testing will be used to fabricate and test the compliant knee joint.  Finally,
    the knee-ankle-foot-orthosis devices fabricated by conventional and 3D-printing
    methods will be evaluated on patients in clinic and during daily activities. Specifically,
    this project aims to design, fabricate, and evaluate an individualized knee-ankle-foot-orthosis
    (KAFO) with metal and plastic 3D-printed parts. Students will study four research
    topics related to the KAFO: (1) biomechanical quantification of activities and
    lifestyles of KAFO patients, (2) analysis and design of a patient-specific compliant
    knee joint, (3) manufacturing of compliant knee joint, and (4) evaluation of the
    patient-specific KAFO.\n\nThe broader impact of the proposed work in design, 3D-printing,
    and evaluation of personalized assistive devices is to re-establish the quality-of-life
    of people with disabilities by restoring normal joint motion and function. Personalized
    assistive devices with good fit and quick delivery can greatly benefit patients
    as well as their caregivers. Further, tailoring the function of these devices
    to the patient improves their ability to ambulate and reduces the chances of reinjury.
    The transformative aspects of this project are the mass production of custom assistive
    devices and the long-term monitoring of the gait and mobility of assistive device
    users for physical and psychological diagnosis and prevention of fall and other
    accidents. The knowledge and biomechanical models can improve the design practice
    and evaluation of the efficacy of a broad range of assistive devices.\n\nThis
    award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through

    drinking water and adequate sanitation. Although there have been a number of efforts
    to develop low-cost, efficient methods to treat water and wastewater, many of
    them fail in practice due to the lack of understanding of social and economic
    factors, and the lack of community engagement. This project will engage fifteen
    (15) IRES participants and three (3) graduate assistants from STEM, STEM education,
    public health and social sciences in carrying out research to develop, test and
    implement the technologies, such as biosand filters and decentralized sanitation
    systems, while uncovering and addressing social factors that limit their use in
    the field. The project will take place in collaboration with students and faculty
    at Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST), as well as teachers
    and pupils in a local secondary school in Kumasi, Ghana.  US students will experience
    real on-the-ground water and sanitation situations that will enhance their research
    skills as they develop the global competence needed to work effectively in developing
    countries.  Specific objectives are to: 1) increase the number of US students
    engaging in global water and sanitation research, 2) enhance student understanding
    of the complexity of water and sanitation challenges and increase their global
    competency, 3) engage secondary school teachers and pupils in Ghana in authentic
    science and participatory action research, and 4) develop strong collaborations
    between USF and KNUST for water and sanitation research and education.\n\nThe
    participating research teams will advance research and development of: 1) biosand
    filters that simultaneously address infectious disease and dental/skeletal health
    risks that are prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa, and 2) decentralized ecological
    sanitation technologies, such as constructed wetlands, urine diverting dry toilets
    and biodigesters, which recover valuable resources (water, nutrients, energy)
    from human wastes.  Each team will work on technology development, appropriate
    financing mechanisms and effective behavioral and educational approaches to improve
    WASH practices. \n\nIRES participants will directly experience WASH research in
    the geopolitical, socioeconomic and cultural context of Ghana.  These experiences
    will enhance their understanding of WASH challenges and build their global competency.
    \ We will recruit female and underrepresented minority students through programs
    and clubs that emphasize diversity, community colleges and minority serving institutions.
    \ Extensive professional development and mentoring programs are planned for IRES
    participants.  Results will be integrated into courses taught by the PIs and outreach
    to the Tampa Bay community, K12 science teachers and students.  The project will
    strengthen the partnership between USF and KNUST and create opportunities for
    future collaborations, particularly in WASH research.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's

- abstractText: "Materials scientists from the University of Vermont will partner
    with engineers and physicists at Yamagata University (Japan) for an IRES program
    that will foster and nurture a new generation of interdisciplinary materials scientists.
    At the end of the program participants will be equipped with key experimental
    skills and background tailored for the specific needs of organic electronics research
    and technology that bridge physical chemistry, chemical engineering, and condensed
    matter physics. Three PhDs and twelve undergraduate US students will spend ten
    weeks working in teams with the Japanese mentors and their students on interdisciplinary
    projects specifically designed to leverage the ongoing collaboration on small
    molecules electronics between the US and Japanese participants. The students will
    learn specific experimental techniques while immersed in a new, culturally -distinct
    collaborative environment. They will gain unprecedented access to fabrication
    and characterization techniques inaccessible at their home institution. Students
    will undergo a two-week intensive language training specifically focused on laboratory
    work communication and become part of the cultural immersion activities at Yamagata
    University. The group also benefits from the contribution of a school of education
    faculty member that will conduct assessment activities resulting in best practices
    recommendations for a Global Scientist certificate offering at the University
    of Vermont.  A semester -long recruitment plan will focus on women and minorities
    from small or HBCU colleges in the northeastern United States.\n\nFor the past
    ten years, synthetic chemistry efforts that produced soluble derivatives of small
    molecule semiconductors led to macroscopically-ordered crystalline thin films
    and scalable, cost-effective roll-to-roll processing techniques that promise a
    future where flexible, bio-integrated, or disposable electronics may play a significant
    role in our everyday lives. Though these advances have been incredibly significant,
    the performance metrics of organic semiconductor-based transistors, LEDs, and
    solar cells are still far behind (to varying degrees) their crystalline inorganic
    counterparts.  The scientific and engineering communities are at a turning point
    where the next major step forward can only be realized with novel interdisciplinary
    approaches based on a fundamental understanding of the electronic and excitonic
    properties. \nThe Vermont -Yamagata IRES partnership will foster and nurture a
    new generation of interdisciplinary materials scientists, that will become experts
    ready to tackle the grand challenges of small molecule electronics. The underlying
    scientific theme of the student projects investigates correlations between long-range
    order, the nature of intermolecular interactions, and electronic properties in
    small molecule families. It seeks ways of exploiting these correlations towards
    establishing design rules for optimization of electronic and excitonic properties
    of small molecule thin films. Such design rules lead to avenues for affordable,
    sustainable, organic device platforms for a variety of applications including
    photovoltaics, flexible electronics, and bio-interfacing. The proposed experimental
    work will also trigger theoretical questions related to bridging the quantum chemistry
    body of knowledge with condensed matter approaches that take into account long
    range interactions, thus building an interdisciplinary model for excitonic and
    charge carrier behavior in these systems.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory

    Nanoscience is one of the most exciting areas of modern research stretching across the whole spectrum of science including: physics, engineering, chemistry, medicine and health. Computational Nanoscience addresses the challenges of this rapidly evolving field by using novel computational methods to tackle practical problems.

    The main objective of this project is to create international research opportunity for students and immerse them in creative computational nanoscience projects. Through the international research experience,  students will become part of a new generation of computational scientists modeling outstanding problems in materials science, physics and chemistry as researchers in industry, academia, and government labs. To achieve this, students will be trained in both theoretical and practical aspects of computational modeling, and further their professional development through participation in computational projects in an international research environment. The international research framework will allow students to be practitioners and innovators in computational modeling by educating them in both fundamentals (mathematics, physics, computational tools, material science and computer science) and applications.  The students will have opportunity to do research in Japan's leading research center (Tsukuba Science City), world renowned National Lab (RIKEN) and best university (University of Tokyo) and will have access to the world's best supercomputers. In addition, the students will be exposed to Japan's multifaceted culture, traditions, history and natural beauty.

    The proposed research presents broad training opportunities for students overarching physics, electrical engineering, material science, quantum mechanical simulations, high performance computing, and novel computational algorithms. The proposed international collaboration
    will provide an unparalleled research environment for students, exposing them to the forefront of scientific challenges and technological innovations from an international podium. The projects will encourage the participation of underrepresented groups by leveraging the Vanderbilt-Fisk bridge program and by actively recruiting minority students. The students will also be introduced into the
    rich culture and history of Japan. The host Japanese groups will also likely to benefit not only from the research outcomes but through the international cultural exchange and experience.

    The US students will pursue time-dependent simulations of electron and ion dynamics in nanomaterials using novel atomistic quantum mechanical approaches. These investigations will be frontier applications of time-dependent first-principles quantum mechanical calculations to describe interaction of electromagnetic fields and matter, electron transport and scattering and physics of ultracold atoms. The results of these simulations will be valuable in evaluating the experiments probing new frontiers of material science.

    In collaboration with Japanese research groups, researchers from VU have developed a linear scaling atomistic approach to simulate the time-dependent behavior of molecules, solids, and nanostructures in time-dependent external fields. The approach allows for the simulation of electron and ion dynamics in systems containing thousands of atoms, incorporating the effect of electromagnetic fields by coupling the time-dependent Maxwell and Schrodinger equations. The participating students will use these computer simulations tools to study various systems, including high harmonics generation in solids, interaction of laser pulses and 2D materials, ionization and fragmentation of molecules by circularly polarized light, low energy scattering of electrons and biomolecules, and other interesting cases. The students will also develop and test novel computational approaches to increase the speed and accuracy of quantum simulations.

    The fundamental goals of this proposal are increasing the diversity of students studying environmental science and training the next generation of global scientists. US students will work in collaborative teams with scientists from UMBC and the Bahamas to study the critically endangered Bahama Oriole. Six students per year will work with mentors doing international research in the Bahamas, followed by data analysis and presentation back at UMBC. These projects will enable students to develop deep understanding of a range of topics in environmental science related to island ecosystems, extinction and climate dynamics. Island ecosystems have always been vulnerable to human impacts, and many island species are endangered or have become extinct. The islands of the Caribbean represent a biodiversity hotspot that is acutely threatened by climate variations. The Caribbean is home to fifteen endangered songbird species, including the critically endangered Bahama Oriole (Icterus northropi). The proposed student research experience is a collaboration between the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) and The Bahamas National Trust (BNT) to determine the status of the Bahama Oriole and to understand how habitat and climate change may affect it.

    In the current global extinction crisis, islands are especially vulnerable, and most endangered and extinct avian species are (or were) island species. The Bahama Oriole is now restricted to Andros, having been extirpated from Abaco in the 1990s. The likely threats facing the Bahama Oriole are typical for island species, ranging from introduced predators to anthropogenic habitat change. The impacts of climate change on endemic species in the Caribbean may be especially intense drying and warming are altering fire regimes while rising sea levels and increased hurricane intensity are causing forest mortality. The proposed student research projects address the full scope of these issues facing this critically endangered songbird. Teams of Bahamian and US mentors will together advise undergraduate students on a series of independent research projects. One UMBC PhD student will be continually on-site in the Bahamas to help mentor the students. Student projects will teach the students skills that can be applied in a range of STEM careers. Project topics include 1) population ecology (e.g., estimating population size), 2) remote sensing (e.g., effects of climate change on pine habitat), and 3) predation (e.g., radio tracking to study annual survival). Recently, the research team conducted two pilot trips with diverse teams of students from UMBC and The Bahamas. These student-led efforts confirmed the feasibility of these projects and demonstrated how little is known about the Bahama Oriole.

    Human activities have dramatically altered natural ecosystems, causing the sixth mass extinction event of our planet's history. To curb this unprecedented loss of biological diversity, it is critical to understand how organisms respond to and persist in such rapidly-changing environments. This International Research Experiences for Students (IRES) project will explore how natural populations survive the challenges of their natural environment, and then leverage this understanding to determine how the same populations respond to novel human-mediated changes. This IRES project, therefore, will provide insights needed to slow the current, unprecedented loss of biodiversity.

    This IRES project will train cohorts of 10 undergraduate students, targeting those underrepresented in STEM (i.e., women and minorities), for a period of six weeks each year in field research and conservation science in the remote Solomon Islands. The Solomon Islands serve as an ideal setting for this IRES project, as the archipelago is composed of dynamic ecosystems where organisms face constantly-changing conditions caused by both natural and anthropogenic processes. An international team from the University of Miami and local non-government organizations will lead the program, offering diverse perspectives and unique expertise to create a thriving environment for student mentorship. The major goal is for students to first leverage natural systems by executing group experiments that explore how populations meet the challenges of their natural environment. Students will then expand on this understanding of natural systems by developing independent projects to test how the same populations respond to human-mediated disturbances. A follow-up course in the US will provide additional training and career development, with the goal of publishing the student projects. The result is an IRES program where a diverse, international team will equip the next generation of scientists with a more global perspective to tackle our planet's most pressing challenges.

    This IRES project has two major broader impacts. First, this project will train undergraduate students in international research and conservation, targeting those underrepresented in STEM (i.e., women and minorities). This IRES project will therefore tackle the lack of diversity in STEM, and provide international experience that is critical for preparing students to compete in a global market. Second, this IRES project will help establish conservation initiatives in a biodiversity hotspot. The conservation initiative includes students working with local stakeholders in collecting field data and conducting outreach to empower local communities in establishing sustainable practices. By collecting baseline data, students involved in this IRES project will help in the establishment of an ambitious conservation area. This IRES project, therefore, addresses a fundamental question in Biology, while providing students with experience in initiating impactful conservation programs.

- abstractText: "The objective of this project is to provide U.S. students with valuable
    research experience related to battery-less embedded systems in future Internet
    of Things (IoT) in China, which has one of the world's largest electronic industry
    and market. The project will select five (5) graduate students and two (2) undergraduate
    students nation-wide each year and support them to visit Tsinghua University (THU)
    over a period of eight (8) weeks. \n\nThe vision of IoT is to embed small computers
    into objects around our daily life to improve our economy and societal well-being.
    It is estimated that the Internet of Things (IoT) will consist of almost 50 billion
    objects by 2020. However, one of the biggest challenges is how to power these
    billions of embedded devices since batteries need frequent recharging and impose
    health and environmental concerns. In this project, the students will work with
    renowned research groups at THU to develop future IoT sensors that can reply on
    energy harvested from ambient environment sources, such as solar energy, radio
    frequency energy, kinetic energy, and thermal energy. Since ambient energy is
    intrinsically intermittent, the students will conduct research on nano-scale device,
    circuits, system, and software to realize computer systems that can work with
    intermittent energy supply. Such systems will dramatically improve our capability
    of collecting data while reducing the maintenance costs. Potential applications
    include smart healthcare, smart building and infrastructure monitoring, smart
    environmental monitoring, etc. This IRES project will not only offer U.S. students
    an opportunity to work in one of the best engineering research universities in
    China, but also fully immerse them in a foreign environment and improve their
    talents in working with a global team. \n\nThe project contains well-planned recruitment,
    preparation, mentoring and post-trip activities. The proposed research targets
    at nano-scale device, circuits, system, and software issues in battery-less embedded
    systems that need to be addressed urgently. The first project aims to develop
    fast, energy efficient, and uniform write operations for nano-scale memory device,
    which is critical to tolerate intermittency of harvested energy. The project addresses
    a fundamental inconsistency issue when the NVP is interacting with external volatile
    peripheral devices, which is one of the most imminent roadblocks towards wide
    application of NVPs. \nThe second project addresses a fundamental inconsistency
    issue when the battery-less device is collecting data and communicating with external
    devices. The project aims to develop efficient and accurate binarized neural network
    for individual ultraviolet (UV) exposure pattern recognition system running on
    nonvolatile IoT platform, which could be generalized to many other applications.
    \n The third project aims to develop efficient and accurate artificial intelligence
    for individual ultraviolet (UV) exposure pattern recognition system running on
    battery-less IoT platform, which could be generalized to many other applications.
    It can be anticipated that with the close interaction with THU and the Beijing
    Innovation Center for Future Chips, the breakthroughs made from these projects
    can have a direct impact on future IoT market.\n\nThe project will enable U.S.
    students to conduct high-quality research on realizing battery-less embedded systems,
    in collaboration with their faculty mentors in THU. Such experiences expose U.S.
    students to the international research community at a critical early stage in
    their careers. It is expected that through participating in this program, U.S.
    students will gain extensive experience on the\nresearch of embedded computer
    systems, on the culture of China, and on performing and collaborating in an international
    environment in general. The experience will also be shared to the broader community
    through the personal social media such as Facebook, Twitter, and Youtube, Web2.0
    based forum, carefully integrated activities such as research for undergraduate
    students, minorities and underrepresented groups, as well as outreach events for
    local K-12 schools.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been
    deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual
    merit and broader impacts review criteria."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to enable the commercialization of the carbon dots technology, with the initial focus on uses in high-performance sensors for water and food analyses and in imaging techniques for the early detection of cancers and other biomedical applications. Carbon dots have been developed as nontoxic and environmentally benign alternatives to the commercially available semiconductor quantum dots, which are nanomaterials of excellent optical properties but mostly containing highly toxic heavy metals in order to achieve the desired properties and performance levels. With similarly excellent properties and high performance, carbon dots as carbon-based nanomaterials can be produced from abundant and environmentally friendly precursors. They are benign and nontoxic.  Because of the low-cost nature, the carbon dots technology is also expected to have broader applications beyond the initial focus for many other societal needs.

    This I-Corps project assesses the market potential and the likely customer base for a carbon dots technology. Carbon dots have emerged as a rapidly advancing and expanding field of research and development. Under the umbrella of the carbon dots technology, significant applications in a number of technological areas have been explored, including carbon dots as extremely sensitive, yet benign and nontoxic, optical probes, potent photocatalysts, photodynamic agents for therapy and other purposes, antibacterial and antiviral agents, and materials and components in various renewable energy and energy conversion devices. The focus of this project is on the technology for imaging and sensing to take advantage of the most important and uniquely advantageous characteristics and properties of carbon dots, specifically on several high-value uses for immediate commercial development.

    This International Research Experiences for Students (IRES) program, organized by Professors Ali Mehrizi-Sani and Chen-Ching Liu from Washington State University (WSU), in collaboration with Prof. Stephen McArthur and his colleagues from the University of Strathclyde (Scotland), provides six US students with the opportunity to participate in the diverse smart grid research atmosphere at one of leading, most highly funded, and most entrepreneurial European universities. This program is developed out of a 20-year collaborative relationship between WSU and the University of Strathclyde. The students will undertake projects to address challenges in renewable energy integration. Ultimately, the research performed in this program will help increase the utilization of distributed renewable energy resources in the power system of the future, the smart grid. This research benefits our society and environment by (i) increasing penetration of renewable energy resources, (ii) increasing career interest in power system and the smart grid, and (iii) improving the quality and quantity of the power engineering workforce in the United States. These benefits directly translate into a more capable and larger student intake that can address the workforce shortage problem; it also helps the transition to a modern power grid with higher efficiency, reliability, and resiliency.

    The students in this program will perform research relevant to smart grid and the electric power system. Electrical power is critical to the U.S. economy. However, most of the current U.S. electric infrastructure is outdated. What exacerbates this problem is that this infrastructure still runs mainly on legacy control, monitoring, and protection systems that may not realize its full potential. While environmental concerns and energy independence recommend utilizing renewable resources in the power system, one of the U.S. grand energy challenges remains to integrate large amounts of renewable energy. These challenges also add to the difficulty of enforcing resiliency of the power system to major disturbances and events. The research to be undertaken in this project seeks to address this challenge through activities on (i) accurate and fast controllers for integration of renewables, (ii) resilient distribution systems, and (iii) and system-agnostic controls of microgrid resources. Compared to the United States, many European countries have a more mature experience in the utilization of renewable energy resources. The University of Strathclyde maintains one of the largest power programs in Europe and, as a prime example of an institution with proven track record in research and industry collaboration, is an ideal partner in this project that combines an international research experience for students with outstanding research capacity.

    of Materials Research (DMR) in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences
    (MPS) and the Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE),
    this project aims to advance the use of modern data science in chemistry. In particular,
    the project will advance the field of data-driven chemical research by promoting
    the use of machine learning and other data mining techniques in the molecular
    sciences and by fostering and coalescing a community of stakeholders. The work
    of the project and the community it represents aims to transform chemistry's ability
    to tackle challenging discovery and design problems. This approach can dramatically
    accelerate and streamline the process that leads to chemical innovation -- an
    important factor in economic and technological advancement -- and thus result
    in an improved return on public and private investments. The project also addresses
    corresponding questions of training and workforce development needed in chemistry,
    thus insuring the US's international competitiveness. \n\nThe mission of this
    project is to assert the role of big data research in the chemical domain, i.e.,
    to promote, enable, and advance the ideas of data-driven discovery and rational
    design. The project aims to create a community-driven roadmap as well as facilitate
    concrete solutions that are beyond the scope of the disjointed efforts of its
    individual stakeholders. The Big Data Hubs and Spokes ecosystem is the ideal framework
    to realizing this vision and accelerating progress in this high-priority area
    of research. The effort at hand sets out to implement some of the key findings
    of the recent NSF Division of Chemistry workshop on Framing the Role of Big Data
    and Modern Data Science in Chemistry. The four signature initiatives of this Spoke
    project include (i) the planning, coordination, integration, and consolidation
    of community-developed software tools for big data research in chemistry as well
    as the formulation of guidelines, best practices, and standards; (ii) the organization
    of workshops for community building, to connect solution seekers with solution
    providers, and to address questions ranging from strategic to technical; and (iii)
    the creation and dissemination of community-developed teaching materials as well
    as the formulation of course, program, and curricular recommendations for education
    and workforce development that reflect the changing, data-centric approach in
    chemical research; (iv) providing access to a shared hardware infrastructure for
    community data sets, on-site data mining capacity, and the exploration of domain
    specific method and hardware issues.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission

    promise in the quest for performance under hypersonic conditions related to sub-orbital
    and reusable space vehicles. This IRES will provide a 10-week summer session every
    year for 3 years, to enable 4 US students annually, both at the graduate and undergraduate
    levels, to acquire knowledge in manufacturing, testing and simulation of advanced
    material systems exhibiting durability in extreme environments. Through the program,
    students experience large-scale facilities at DLR Aerospace in Cologne, Germany,
    including materials manufacturing and testing systems to design and develop experimental
    samples. This experience offers joint participation of US and German researchers
    in synchrotron studies at the Argonne National Laboratory with mentorship from
    both German and US-based scientists. Students will gain a rare insight into the
    full cycle of emerging materials research. Research outcomes have long terms societal
    benefits in creating a new class of materials for next generation energy, propulsion
    and transportation needs. The educational broader impact of the international
    collaborative research is achieved through i) an exchange of knowledge of high
    resolution techniques in processing, experimentation and simulation ii) opportunities
    for students at the graduate and undergraduate levels to experience collaborative
    research in highly advanced facilities focused on each expertise with mentoring
    from highly trained scientists as well as peer mentoring between graduate and
    senior undergraduate students, iii) a pre-trip German Engineering Exchange (GEEx)
    activity with local high school students (taking German language) teaching basic
    German Language in exchange for engineering activities organized by the participants.
    Research opportunities in Germany will be shared with the rising freshmen through
    this activity. \n\nPart 2\nThis IRES project facilitates international experiences
    for students, through collaborative research between the German Aerospace Center
    (DLR) and the University of Central Florida (UCF), in support of the search for
    materials that can sustain extreme physical and mechanical environments applicable
    to hypersonic and reusable space vehicles. DLR's expertise in advanced processing
    of high temperature ceramics and ceramic matrix composites will complement UCF's
    unique capability to capture the mechanics of these complex layered material systems
    directly, under operational and real environments. The research enables investigation
    of the strain evolution in these materials over thermal-mechanical or thermal
    gradient-mechanical cycles, crack propagation under extreme environments and effects
    of geometry on strain and damage propagation through in-situ synchrotron measurements
    conducted by the UCF and DLR researchers in partnership with Argonne National
    Laboratory. The results will enable fundamental knowledge on the mechanical properties
    and behavior of these materials with outcomes that have the potential to extend
    operational capacity and durability under high temperature."

    Today's cities and communities, and their residents, are increasingly connected, and decisions are informed by actionable, real-time data. Data is making modern cities and local communities faster and safer, as well as more sustainable, livable, and equitable. At the same time, smart city technologies raise concerns about individuals' privacy, autonomy, choice, and possible misuse. Government officials are raising important questions about who should own data, how privacy protections for public-facing technologies work, who and how to communicate with the public about privacy, and more. The long-term vision of the project is to help municipal leaders strengthen their ability to collect, use, and share data in a responsible manner. This will help grow privacy-preserving innovations across applications and geographic boundaries for the public good. In this way, the Smart Privacy for Smart Cities Spoke will serve to increase public knowledge, understanding and engagement with privacy-related concerns, and ultimately promote the public's trust in smart city technologies and in their local government.

    The Smart Privacy for Smart Cities Spoke is a collaborative project led by the FPF Education and Innovation Foundation (FPF EIF). It will undertake three interrelated activities to help city/community innovators understand and incorporate privacy considerations and protections into smart city projects. First, the Spoke will produce a privacy risk assessment framework for smart city projects, including guidance on what policies, practices and accountability structures should be put in place and how to weigh benefits of new or expanded data techniques against attendant privacy and security risks. The framework will feature a de-identification component as de-identification is one of the primary measures that organizations can take to protect and share data in a privacy-preserving manner. Second, the Spoke will establish a network of privacy leaders for smart cities and communities, helping municipal officials better understand, communicate, and collaboratively address privacy issues and principles. Lastly, the Spoke will hold two workshops in partnership with MetroLab Network, a national network of 40+ city-university partnerships advancing technological approaches to urban challenges. The workshops will serve to launch the privacy leaders network; educate network members about the privacy risk assessment framework; and identify areas for further collaboration and research, particularly in applying the framework to specific technologies and data uses. Expected project outcomes include wide dissemination of the privacy risk assessment framework and its adoption in specific localities; development of new collaborations and partnerships through the privacy leaders network and associated workshops; and as an overall outcome, the advancement of civic leaders' knowledge, understanding, and application of privacy protection(s) toward standards of practice for smart cities and privacy. The project will support and leverage the Hub Network, in particular the South Big Data Hub, NSF's Smart and Connected Communities program, and the MetroLab Network of city-university partners.

    The opioid crisis ravaging Ohio and the Midwest disproportionally affects small and rural communities. Harnessing and deploying data holds promise for developing a response to this crisis by policymakers, healthcare providers, and citizens of the communities. Currently, there are many barriers to getting data into the hands of individuals on the frontlines. Crucial data are siloed across law enforcement, public health departments, hospitals and clinics, and county administrations; data often are inaccurate or collected in non-standard ways across different agencies and departments; the stigma of drug abuse limits accurate reporting of drug-related deaths; and information is not shared with the community and other stakeholders because of the lack of a privacy and security framework. Such barriers, for example, prevent individuals with addictions or their families and friends from locating available treatment centers or obtaining other important information in a timely way. Similarly, it is difficult for first responders and healthcare providers to obtain critical up-to-date information. In predominantly rural counties, these challenges are especially daunting because there is often poor connectivity and communication infrastructure. This Big Data Spoke project involves developing scalable, flexible, and connectivity-rich data-driven approaches to address the opioid epidemic. The cyberinfrastructure framework, OpenOD, will be initially designed and deployed in small and rural communities in Appalachia Ohio and the Midwest, where the need for data and connection are greatest. Based upon significant community input, OpenOD will also create end-user applications or enterprise solutions to support stakeholders and communities to mount a response they feel will be most efficient and beneficial at the local level. As a Spoke to NSF?s Midwest Big Data Hub, our efforts can be efficiently scaled, disseminated, and applied to the opioid and other societal problems such as infant mortality, crime, and natural disasters. This project fits within NSF's mission to promote the progress of science (contribute to the science and engineering of large socially relevant cyberinfrastructures) to advance the health and welfare of US citizens (by linking data sources in new and useful ways to empower communities to address societal problems; establishing sustainable partnerships between academia, industry, government and communities; increasing data literacy and community engagement with data science; and enhancing research and education via development/adaptation of training modules and courses in data analytics).

    The main goal of this project is to help small and rural communities in the Midwest address the opioid epidemic via BIGDATA (BD) technology. While no communities have been spared, small and rural communities face unique challenges in confronting the opioid epidemic: knowledge and data exist in siloes across multiple organizations with varying jurisdictional boundaries; efforts to collect, link, and analyze data are hampered by a lack of infrastructure and tools; rural areas are plagued by "dead zones" in cellular connectivity; communities lack capacity for data collection, and analytics; needs and resources across effected communities are not uniform and require BD approaches that are flexible, open, leverage significant community input, and can be dutifully validated. Our proposed solution is OpenOD, a framework that provides uniform, relevant and timely access to data. Working integrally with the Midwest Big Data Hub (MBDH) and our partners, our three main objectives are to: (1) Work with local communities to understand strengths and gaps in cyberinfrastructure, data availability, and need for data analytics workforce skills. (2) Assemble flexible cyberinfrastructure that includes a data commons, stakeholder-usable and cloud-amenable data analytics and visualization tools, and internet connectivity with both mobile and non-mobile capabilities. (3) Validate, evaluate, and disseminate cyberinfrastructure and data analytics tools to stakeholder groups throughout the region while fostering new partnerships. OpenOD will create approaches that will allow governing units to deploy openly available tools rather than rely on proprietary tools. In this way, existing disparities in data access and ensuing responses are effectively addressed. The potential contributions of the project are to: (1) Increase BD and STEM literacy and community engagement in underrepresented groups given the operating milieu of OpenOD in rural areas where the population is indigent and lacks adequate skills to join the modern workforce. (2) Improve well-being of individuals in society by linking data sources in new and useful ways to empower communities to address the opioid crisis; improved connectivity and timely delivery of critical information will accelerate community responsiveness and improve preventive strategies. (3) Provide infrastructure for research and education will be improved given that project activities will deliver linked, curated data sets to community stakeholders, researchers and educators. Training modules and courses adapted and developed and shared with local/regional educators and will remain with the communities after the funding period has ended. In addition, new and established partnerships will allow sustainability of the project in the communities for the long-term.

    The opioid crisis ravaging Ohio and the Midwest disproportionally affects small and rural communities. Harnessing and deploying data holds promise for developing a response to this crisis by policymakers, healthcare providers, and citizens of the communities. Currently, there are many barriers to getting data into the hands of individuals on the frontlines. Crucial data are siloed across law enforcement, public health departments, hospitals and clinics, and county administrations; data often are inaccurate or collected in non-standard ways across different agencies and departments; the stigma of drug abuse limits accurate reporting of drug-related deaths; and information is not shared with the community and other stakeholders because of the lack of a privacy and security framework. Such barriers, for example, prevent individuals with addictions or their families and friends from locating available treatment centers or obtaining other important information in a timely way. Similarly, it is difficult for first responders and healthcare providers to obtain critical up-to-date information. In predominantly rural counties, these challenges are especially daunting because there is often poor connectivity and communication infrastructure. This Big Data Spoke project involves developing scalable, flexible, and connectivity-rich data-driven approaches to address the opioid epidemic. The cyberinfrastructure framework, OpenOD, will be initially designed and deployed in small and rural communities in Appalachia Ohio and the Midwest, where the need for data and connection are greatest. Based upon significant community input, OpenOD will also create end-user applications or enterprise solutions to support stakeholders and communities to mount a response they feel will be most efficient and beneficial at the local level. As a Spoke to NSF?s Midwest Big Data Hub, our efforts can be efficiently scaled, disseminated, and applied to the opioid and other societal problems such as infant mortality, crime, and natural disasters. This project fits within NSF's mission to promote the progress of science (contribute to the science and engineering of large socially relevant cyberinfrastructures) to advance the health and welfare of US citizens (by linking data sources in new and useful ways to empower communities to address societal problems; establishing sustainable partnerships between academia, industry, government and communities; increasing data literacy and community engagement with data science; and enhancing research and education via development/adaptation of training modules and courses in data analytics).

    The main goal of this project is to help small and rural communities in the Midwest address the opioid epidemic via BIGDATA (BD) technology. While no communities have been spared, small and rural communities face unique challenges in confronting the opioid epidemic: knowledge and data exist in siloes across multiple organizations with varying jurisdictional boundaries; efforts to collect, link, and analyze data are hampered by a lack of infrastructure and tools; rural areas are plagued by "dead zones" in cellular connectivity; communities lack capacity for data collection, and analytics; needs and resources across effected communities are not uniform and require BD approaches that are flexible, open, leverage significant community input, and can be dutifully validated. Our proposed solution is OpenOD, a framework that provides uniform, relevant and timely access to data. Working integrally with the Midwest Big Data Hub (MBDH) and our partners, our three main objectives are to: (1) Work with local communities to understand strengths and gaps in cyberinfrastructure, data availability, and need for data analytics workforce skills. (2) Assemble flexible cyberinfrastructure that includes a data commons, stakeholder-usable and cloud-amenable data analytics and visualization tools, and internet connectivity with both mobile and non-mobile capabilities. (3) Validate, evaluate, and disseminate cyberinfrastructure and data analytics tools to stakeholder groups throughout the region while fostering new partnerships. OpenOD will create approaches that will allow governing units to deploy openly available tools rather than rely on proprietary tools. In this way, existing disparities in data access and ensuing responses are effectively addressed. The potential contributions of the project are to: (1) Increase BD and STEM literacy and community engagement in underrepresented groups given the operating milieu of OpenOD in rural areas where the population is indigent and lacks adequate skills to join the modern workforce. (2) Improve well-being of individuals in society by linking data sources in new and useful ways to empower communities to address the opioid crisis; improved connectivity and timely delivery of critical information will accelerate community responsiveness and improve preventive strategies. (3) Provide infrastructure for research and education will be improved given that project activities will deliver linked, curated data sets to community stakeholders, researchers and educators. Training modules and courses adapted and developed and shared with local/regional educators and will remain with the communities after the funding period has ended. In addition, new and established partnerships will allow sustainability of the project in the communities for the long-term.

    The risk to coastal populations and infrastructure from flooding due to sea level rise, severe storms, and river discharge will increase for U.S. southern states. The vision of this project is that communities occupying low-lying coastal areas of the southern US will be protected and develop in a sustainable manner through planning based on knowledge, conservation, and wise use of sensitive lands. Researchers from the University of South Florida's College of Marine Science and the School of Geosciences, Texas A&M University Corpus Christi, and Google Earth Engine are collaborating with the South Big Data Hub through this project to develop more accurate, ultra-high resolution topographic, land cover, and urban environment geospatial products. The project examines in detail areas that were directly impacted by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma in 2017, and identifies flood-prone areas across the region. The 3D maps show habitat diversity, needed to plan for conservation and development in these important ecosystems.

    This project will develop the improved topographic and land cover maps of the south States within 50 Km of the coast from Texas to Florida (an area >220,000 square Km). The maps will be constructed using a Big Data approach, using detailed historical airborne LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data collected from airplanes merged with high spatial resolution (<2 m pixel) multispectral commercial satellite imagery. The project will also include research into detailed 3D mapping of urban areas using Structure-from-Motion (SfM) methods; specifically the project will map portions of Houston/Corpus Christi in Texas, and Tampa/Saint Petersburg in Florida, using Kite Photography and light aircraft. The production of land cover maps and digital elevation models requires the fusion of very large amounts of disparate data and efficient, automated techniques. The project will develop the strategies to aggregate these data into useful products using Google Earth Engine and a High Performance Computing cluster. The project will distribute all products openly via NOAA's Digital Coastal portal.

- abstractText: "This project focuses on investigating a new paradigm in renewable
    energy harvesting that would be of great use for developing modular power source
    for use in most of the developing world, and specifically for the continent of
    Africa.  Currently only 20-23% of the population in Africa has access to electricity.
    \ Large percentage of the population lives far from urban centers.  Only portable
    energy sources will be able to meet, at least partially, the energy needs of rural
    populations.  A diverse group of undergraduate and graduate students enrolled
    in this program will engage in research on a novel concept of renewable energy
    harvesting.  They will develop working modules that will be tested in the field
    with the aim of producing efficient portable energy sources to improve the lives
    of people living in rural Africa.  In addition, the cultural experience gained
    through interactions with the tribal communities in Africa, and the knowledge
    gained on the way of life in each tribe, their societal rules and norms, and the
    struggles they face in day-to-day life, will transform their view of the world.
    \ Their efforts will be highly rewarding, as they will be contributing to increase
    the renewable and portable power generation in these remote areas that will greatly
    improve the quality of life for the segment of the world population that is lagging
    behind the norms. \nTo implement the project the PI at the University of South
    Florida (USF) will collaborate with the researchers at the Botswana International
    University of Science and Technology (BIUST).  After completing a 3-week research
    program at USF, students will travel to Botswana and will team up with a cohort
    of students at BIUST for a 5-week period where they will learn, live, work, and
    travel together. \n\nThe primary goal of research is to study the feasibility
    of combining thermoelectric modules and solar devices to generate much higher
    electrical power than what is possible with individual devices.  Thermoelectric
    modules formed with materials of high Seebeck coefficient can produce high voltages
    but low conductivity that leads to low currents.  Typical solar cell open-circuit
    voltages are relatively low, but high absorption of radiation can generate high
    density of carriers.  However, high carrier recombination losses lead to low short
    circuit current.  This project will investigate a novel paradigm in which the
    relatively high voltage (1-4 V) produced by the thermoelectric modules from the
    recovery of waste heat of cooking stoves used in rural Africa will be used to
    reverse-bias the solar cell for generating a high photo-generated current.  The
    combination of the high voltage, high current, combined with a suitable circuit
    design, has the potential to enhance power generation and more efficient charging
    of batteries or capacitors.  The outcome will be educating a cohort of graduate
    and undereducated students on energy challenges of the rural communities in the
    world, and developing innovative concepts based on fundamental science to resolve
    issues of the global society. Though the initial effort is to develop a power
    source for rural Africa, the concept can be extended to multitude of commercial
    products and military applications where power can be generated when plugging
    into the power grid is not an option.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission
    and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's

    The goal of this Baja Basins International Research Experiences for Students (Baja Basins IRES) project is for undergraduate student participants to develop skills in conducting and communicating scientific research, to utilize an integrative field and lab research approach using digital technology and modern analytical lab equipment, and to learn international cooperation by collaborating side-by-side with Mexican students, professors, and mining professionals to address research questions on the tectonic evolution of  economically important rift margin basins in Baja California Sur, Mexico. Each year of this three-year program, a cohort of ten undergraduate students will be hosted by Minera Boleo mine for four weeks in January in Baja California Sur, Mexico. Students will conduct geologic fieldwork in topical groups (basin analysis, volcanology, neotectonics, and mineralogy) that will be co-mentored by Mexican and U.S. faculty. Field samples will be sent for geochemical, petrographic, and geochronological analyses. Then in July of the same year, Baja Basins IRES students will reconvene for collaborative lab work and data analyses at the University of Missouri-Kansas City. This will culminate in preparation of student abstracts and poster displays for a local symposium.  Clear educational outcomes and career goals will be measured by appropriate assessment strategies. We will recruit junior undergraduate geoscience majors both nationally and regionally near our home institutions, as this will facilitate the participation of under-represented minority, first-time college, and veteran students who often remain close to their hometown when pursuing higher education. Our collaboration with Mexican colleagues and mining professionals, and the international nature of the fieldwork will provide an unparalleled avenue for cultural enrichment for the students as well as an experience in global cooperation that will be invaluable for a student's future success in an increasingly global workforce and economy.

    The Baja Basins International Research Experiences for Students (Baja Basins IRES) project will provide ten undergraduate student a year with the opportunity to investigate basins located along the central Gulf of California rift in Baja California Sur Mexico, an area that has not been thoroughly mapped within the framework of tectonics and thus provides an excellent field location to study the progressive evolution of a rifted continental margin and its unique continued magmatic activity and economic mineralization. The young geologic age of the sedimentary basins, excellent exposures, and field access, as well as sedimentary fill with numerous tuffs and uplifted terraces dateable by radiometric and OSL methods, make it ideal for resolving the rates of development of structures and resulting depositional systems. This Baja Basins IRES program will provide students with an unprecedented opportunity to collaborate internationally with mentors from our partner universities in Mexico (Universidad Autonoma de Baja California Sur and Universidad de Guanajuato) and several mining companies. Students will develop field and laboratory skills in basin analysis and tectonics in a volcanic-sedimentary sequence that is geologically interesting, economically important, and culturally diverse.

    This project will support the "Graduate-level Research in Industrial Projects for Students-Berlin" (GRIPS) led by the Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics (IPAM). The program will offer graduate students in mathematics and related disciplines the opportunity to work on industry-sponsored research problems in Berlin through a collaboration with Research Campus MODAL in Berlin, Germany. MODAL has existing industrial partners affiliated with their laboratories that provide their research groups with interesting and challenging research problems.  The program will be eight weeks in length; eight US graduate students will participate each summer.  Half of the US students each year will be women, and one or more will be a member of an underrepresented ethnic group. MODAL will  recruit 8 European students to form 4 research groups of two US and two European students each, and provide academic mentors. The program will not only produce interesting research in applications of mathematics to real-life problems, but will give a diverse group of US students an insight into industrial research and provide them with hands-on experience of working on industrial problems. One of the goals of the program is to make the students aware of the multiple career pathways open to them and highlight the value and adaptability of their mathematics skills as applied to interesting real-life problems.  The students will also receive invaluable experience collaborating with foreign colleagues and companies. The projects will be the natural outgrowth of MODAL's existing industry research partnerships, and will be selected in collaboration with IPAM.    Participants will produce a final report on their work, and will be encouraged to submit their work for conference presentations and/or publication in technical journals.  It is expected that many of the participants will continue the research and collaborations they started in the program.

    Applied mathematics research has become increasingly important and relevant to engineering problems and, indeed, to everyday life. Increasingly, core applied mathematics topics, ranging from applied probability, to partial differential equation, to optimization, find important applications in areas such as materials science, mathematical biology, operations research, and, more recently, machine learning. Applications of mathematical techniques to real-life problems require both a deep understanding of mathematical theory, as well as acute awareness of both the physical and technical aspects of the problem, as well as implementation details of any numerical algorithms or simulations. For this reason, such successful applications are often a combination of individual and team efforts, with the main problem being divided into more specialized parts, and specific expertise of each team member brought to bear on each such  component.The exact topics of the research projects will change from year to year and will depend on the interest of industry and academic researchers involved.  Generally speaking, the projects will apply mathematical techniques to questions of optimization (such as optimization of rail network throughput), efficient simulation (such as simulation of modern nanophotonic devices) and machine learning (such as analysis of medical mass data sets).

  title: IRES Track 1 Graduate Research In Industrial Projects for Students - Berlin
- abstractText: "The islands of Oceania are home to diverse fish communities and a
    vibrant myriad of human cultures, all of which have histories are inseparably
    tied to characteristics of the ocean and the islands themselves (e.g. resource
    availability and habitat space), and extent of connectivity among distant islands
    (e.g. currents, migration, etc.). These unifying concepts between culture and
    marine ecology make the holistic study of Pacific Island life ideal for a cross-disciplinary
    research experience.  The PAC-ISLEs program is a year-long research experience
    punctuated by a six-week trip to Oceania, where students will conduct independent
    research projects in marine biology and anthropology, and connect the shared themes
    uniting the two disciplines.  Each year new cohorts will visit a different island
    in Oceania (American Samoa, Tonga, Pohnpei), where they will immerse themselves
    in local communities and collaborate with key foreign mentors that possess expertise
    in community-based conservation, marine ecology, and public education.  Upon returning
    to the US, students will take advantage of the extensive natural history and ethnology
    collections at the Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture to support their
    research projects, and help them share their findings with the public, including
    a highly-engaged community of Pacific Islanders in the Seattle metropolitan area
    and beyond.  \n\nThe islands of Oceania support fish communities and human cultures
    whose histories are inseparably tied to their physical and geographic characteristics
    (e.g. resource availability and habitat space), and the extent of connectivity
    among distant islands (e.g. dispersal potential, gene flow, history of human migrations
    and trade). Students in the PAC-ISLEs program will travel to a unique island each
    of three years to explore these ties between culture and marine ecology, and characterize
    historic changes by measuring similarities in cultural objects or traditional
    activities among islands, and (for fishes) population genetics, taxonomic composition,
    and phylogeography. Students working with fish communities will focus mainly on
    the evolution and community structure of cryptobenthic reef fishes, a poorly studied
    group that can serve as an ideal indicator for evolutionary and contemporary change
    across Pacific Islands. Students working on Pacific Island anthropology will focus
    on aspects of culture that are directly linked to the ocean either through their
    material origins, or role in passing on knowledge about the ocean to future generations.
    Much like the biological communities of Pacific Islands, cultural items may be
    compared across different islands to show the history of change, local adaptation,
    and technological progression. When these data are analyzed and contextualized
    with existing and extensive biological and anthropological collections from Oceania
    at the Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture, findings from PAC-ISLEs have
    the potential to greatly advance our understanding of biological and cultural
    diversity on and around Pacific Islands, while promoting an equitable exchange
    of knowledge between scientists and Pacific Islander communities. Student activities
    extend far beyond the duration of this project, as PAC-ISLEs will help establish
    a permanent conduit for students to connect with overseas sites that would otherwise
    be less accessible for students.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission
    and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
    intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

    Economic globalization is transforming the nature of the engineering profession.  The assignment of U.S. engineers overseas has become common business practice, as global enterprises establish corporate as well as research and development centers worldwide. To remain at the forefront of science and technology and to sustain our nation's global leadership in engineering, we must train our engineering graduates to be productive professionals in tomorrow's global business world and provide them the skills they will need to collaborate with international partners. This three-year IRES program will teach some of those critical skills to U.S. engineering students by providing hands-on research training and cultural experiences in one of the fastest growing regions in the world. The students will conduct research in Egypt with U.S. and Egyptian investigators in the increasingly important field of sustainable urban design. The need for sustainable housing and infrastructure is particularly acute in Egypt, a nation where 95% of the population lives on just 6% of the land area. Students will leverage the many national research initiatives currently underway in Egypt to investigate and test sustainable infrastructure designs. Participants will receive extensive mentoring before, during, and after their international experience from the U.S. and Egyptian researchers, with the ultimate goal of conducting high-level research and preparing research papers for publication in peer-reviewed journals. By working closely with their international mentors, the students will enhance their cross-cultural skills, foreign language abilities, and professional experience, preparing them to excel in a multinational environment.

    This three-year IRES project will provide approximately 30 undergraduate and graduate engineering students research training and cultural experiences in Egypt. The students will work with U.S. mentors and Egyptian researchers at one of the leading national research centers in Egypt, the National Housing and Building Research Center. The program will focus on the multidisciplinary theme of Infrastructure Design for Sustainable Urban Communities. The Egyptian government is currently pressing major research initiatives and demonstration projects related to sustainable urban design, including entire new cities built around sustainability principles. Our students will leverage these ongoing programs to explore and evaluate new designs for urban infrastructure that consider building materials, construction methods, energy efficiency, and water conservation. Working with our Egyptian partners, the researchers have identified eight research projects for the first year of the program that address the topics of sustainable affordable housing, the assessment of sustainable building codes, infrastructure health monitoring, sustainable building materials, water and stormwater management, and intelligent building designs. Additional research topics will be developed in subsequent years. Students will work side-by-side with Egyptian researchers with the goal of performing high-level research and producing student-led, peer-reviewed publications. The program will ultimately produce students who have the skills and international perspective necessary to pursue careers in collaborative international research.

    This International Research Experiences for Students (IRES) project will provide  international research experiences for at least 12 undergraduate and/or graduate students to carry out international collaborative researches at the School of Renewable Energy of North China Electric Power University (NCEPU) in Beijing, China for 8 weeks. The objective of the IRES project is to provide the future American engineers a global perspective and opportunities for their professional growth through meaningful international cooperative research training, networking and mentoring in the fields of renewable energy and environmental sustainability in general, and biomass processing technology and wind turbine aeromechanics, in particular. This  project will bring together IRES participants, involved professors, Chinese faculty members, and their graduate/undergraduate students with multi-cultural background in a multi-level learning experience infused with the excitement of discovery. It will train participants conduct research  in an international research environment  to remain at the forefront of world science and technology, making them more proficient in the technical subjects. The program will provide opportunities for their professional development to build their future collaboration network and expose them to Chinese culture and tradition, applicable technological trends and business practices.

    The research themes of this IRES program are wind turbine aeromechanics and pyrolysis-based biomass thermochemical conversion. By leveraging the unique research facilities and instruments/equipment available at NCEPU and under the supervision of the Chinese faulty mentors, the IRES students on "biomass track" will investigate the effects of blended biomass feedstocks and catalytic co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastic wastes for synergistic production of high quality biofuels and value-added chemicals, while the IRES students on "wind energy track" will conduct comprehensive experimental investigations to quantify surface wind characteristics and evaluate their effects on the aeromechanic performance and wake interferences of wind turbines sited over various complex terrains for higher total power yield and better durability of wind turbines operating on onshore and offshore wind farms. In addition to working in the laboratory to conduct innovative research, the IRES students will also participate in various social and cultural exchanging activities in order to enhance student-faculty, student-mentor and student-student interactions to enable the IRES participants to build their personal friendship and professional connections with participating Chinese mentors and students as well as among the IRES participants themselves on which to build networking for their future professional development and collaboration.

    The scientific goal of this IRES is to gain better understanding for the fabrication of air-stable, photon upconversion thin films or liquids that can operate efficiently with diffuse sunlight, without the need of volatile organic solvents that currently limit practical use in applications.  Complete immersion in Japanese society by spending four to eight weeks in Kyushu University will provide an opportunity to experience and understand the people, traditions and culture. The cultural and scientific exposure that the U.S. students will obtain from this international collaboration will be invaluable. Kyushu University is one of the top-ranked universities in Japan, and the cosmopolitan metropolis of Fukuoka is welcoming to foreigners. This opportunity is expected to enhance the global competitiveness of the participating students in the STEM workforce, and will be made available to qualified U.S. students, especially those underrepresented in science and engineering, by broadly reaching out to the California State university system, the Univ. of California system, and students attending professional conferences organized for example, by the American Chemical Society and Materials Research Society.

    In this international collaboration, four U.S. undergraduate and/ or graduate participants per year will perform fundamental research on triplet-fusion based photon upconversion both in California and Japan. The fusion of molecular excited states with triplet character is the only method for directly upconverting photons from the sun. While these high photon upconversion quantum yields have been demonstrated in volatile organic solvents, they are generally lower in thin film due to poor triplet exciton diffusion. The U.S. students will be synthesizing and fabricating liquid or thin-films of semiconductor nanocrystals and molecular emitters organized in various hosts, including proteins, organogels and surfactants, to understand and control the diffusion of photogenerated triplet excitons. This project aims to use semiconductor nanocrystals to absorb light strongly in the near-infrared wavelengths to address one of the major limitations in molecular triplet photosensitizers. The hybrid nanomaterials will be designed to halt the spontaneous crystallization of the molecular emitter with nitrene crosslinking chemistry; increase triplet diffusion lengths in liquids or thin films with long-range order in covalent organic frameworks and establish a barrier to oxygen to prevent the quenching of spin-triplet excitons.

- abstractText: "Fulfilling the promise of \"Big Data\" for fields, such as migration
    studies, climate science, and food security systems, requires accurate and timely
    data from countries across the globe. Data collected through Internet-of-Things
    (IoT) technologies, such as remote sensors and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs),
    have the potential to contribute to global data hubs. However, most IoT applications
    and their data structures are designed to solve local problems, such as crop protection
    and local food shortage predictions. This IRES SITTE project will train 18 U.S.
    master's students in multicriteria design of and policies for IoT systems with
    the aim of making local IoT data available to global data scientists. \n\nThe
    project involves collaborations with professors/mentors at University of Rwanda
    and Carnegie Mellon Africa, both in Kigali, Rwanda, the former of which serves
    as the Center of Excellence for IoT under the World Bank's Eastern and Southern
    Africa Higher Education Centers of Excellence program. Through the collaboration,
    students will receive interdisciplinary research training in wireless networks,
    software engineering, policy studies and sociotechnical systems. This interdisciplinary
    training will enable designs of low cost IoT systems, usable in a range of contexts,
    including the U.S., while increasing access to data by biology/agriculture and
    forced migration scientists. The training will also enhance students' as well
    as the project's advisory board, consisting of academic scientists and an industry
    innovation professional, on information and communication technology (ICT) innovations
    systems in East Africa, expanding global perspectives within the U.S. IT workforce.\n\nFulfilling
    the promise of the Internet of Things (IoT) requires ongoing systems innovation
    to incorporate advances in foundational technologies, lower costs, and fulfill
    the needs of global data scientists. Designing systems for integration of sensor-derived
    local data into global scientific data platforms, such as the Global Open Data
    for Agriculture and Nutrition (GODAN) hub and the International Organization for
    Migration's (IOM) Migration Data Portal, can simultaneously inform local, regional
    and global challenges of socioeconomic and environmental development. \nThis IRES
    Site Program pursues novel IoT research. The interdisciplinary research combines
    complementary wireless network, software engineering, policy studies, and sociotechnical
    systems expertise of the three mentors and the PI.  The program consists of three
    projects, two technical and one focused on policy analysis. \n\nThe first technical
    project involves unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs, a.k.a. drones) designed for collecting
    data from refugee gardens. Using cameras, the UAVs collect image data processed
    through a Normalized Difference Vegetative Index (NDVI), a standard approach for
    vegetation monitoring. The UAV will also be controlled by software to optimize
    its path-planning, enhancing both coverage i.e. canvassing the target area, and
    network connectivity.  The second technical project targets device-to-device communications
    (D2D) for systems without access to a power grid, through innovations in hardware,
    software and data management systems, designed to improve crop information on
    tea estates.  A third project focuses on IoT policy analyses at national and organizational
    levels. The analyses will highlight current trends in Rwandan IoT use, system
    vulnerabilities, as well as national and organizational policies that may affect
    data sharing practices and hinder access by Big Data scientists.\n\nThis IRES
    Site Program develops interdisciplinary and creative information technology professionals
    capable of solving multi-criteria design problems. Through intellectually challenging
    yet appropriately scoped projects, master's students are exposed to international
    innovation systems and gain insights into the culture of East Africa. The program's
    design includes both pre-departure and follow-on courses, insuring effective student
    preparation and widespread dissemination of results.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's

    Records of past climate variability from northern Europe will improve our ability to predict future environmental changes in the North Atlantic region. This IRES project will partner with premier universities in Estonia to train students in interdisciplinary field-based environmental science methods in order to develop archives of past temperature and precipitation changes from the Baltic region. Each year the project will involve initial orientations, 5 weeks of international summer field and lab-based instruction, follow-up laboratory work at home institutions during the academic year, and conference presentations in the spring. A total of 4 students (undergraduate and graduate) and 1 in-service public science teacher (RET) each year will be recruited, and all the undergraduate participants will be from 2 year colleges in northern Illinois. Students from underrepresented groups will be targeted, and at least one undergraduate student per year will be from a non-STEM background.

    This project will apply a multi-proxy approach to explore the timing and causes of historic climate variability in northern Europe. Student projects will be interrelated to develop a better understanding of how shifting Northern Hemisphere temperatures and mean-state conditions of the North Atlantic Ocean have influenced the climate dynamics of the eastern Baltic region. These datasets will serve as predictive tools for future variation across the Northern Hemisphere. Student projects will focus on lake sediment geochemistry (stable isotopes - ?18O and ?13C), paleoecology, and biology as tools to reconstruct past climate conditions. The educational goals are to: 1) Engage students in societally-relevant scientific topics to promote interest in STEM fields; 2) Mentor participants in state-of-the-art scientific research methods to better prepare them for STEM majors, careers, and advanced degrees; 3) Develop participants written and oral communication skills through mentoring and public presentations; and 4) Recruit underrepresented minority students and in-service public science teachers to promote diversity and sustainable impacts in public schools. The program components, project team, and participant experience will be rigorously evaluated by a geoscience education research specialist.

    The overarching goal of this project is to involve and train undergraduate and graduate student researchers from UCSB and other institutions in different scientific, academic, and international venues to develop a highly skilled, diverse and globally engaged workforce who can address energy challenges of today and the future. Three undergraduate students and four graduate students will travel to Chalmers University of Technology (Gothenburg, Sweden) each year for 8-10 week long research experiences. UCSB graduate students taking part in the research experiences at Chalmers will be recruited based on collaborative research topics, working broadly in the area of materials chemistry for energy conversion and storage. Undergraduate students will be recruited from US colleges and universities to participate in the summer undergraduate IRES program, with particular focus on recruiting participation by women and underrepresented minorities. The international component of the research and program will provide students with cultural perspectives and the opportunity to develop a global network in science.
    The scientific challenge of this IRES project is to design, create, and understand novel materials and materials systems that can capture, convert, and store energy. This will be accomplished through synergistic and complementary coupling of resources and expertise in state-of-the-art synthesis, simulation, characterization, and testing at UCSB, Chalmers University of Technology, and multi-user x-ray and neutron facilities in Sweden. IRES students will participate in collaborative research between UCSB and Chalmers University through international research visits focused on battery materials; magnetocalorics, thermoelectrics, and dynamic polymers for energy capture; and carbon and oxide-based materials for electrocatalysis and electrochemical energy storage.

    This research project will develop a collaborative data science platform for computational social science called the Data Science Foundry. The collection and management of large-scale data currently is a relatively unstructured process, with data-processing decisions being made in an ad hoc fashion. Society has started to rely on data-driven science to address policy-related questions, however. The development of a collaborative platform that provides structure will allow social scientists to collaborate and validate each other's studies.  This project has the potential to transform how studies are designed and how data will be processed. The collaborative platform will result in a higher level of trust in the studies conducted via the collaborative curation of study design, procedures, and validation. The collaborative platform also will increase the number of studies that can be done in a short span of time. The platform will be developed as open-source, thereby facilitating interactions with the community and enabling different institutions to install the program.

    This project will develop a collaborative platform that social scientists can use to collaborate and validate each other's studies. The investigative team will attempt to identify the best possible collaborative model for data-driven social science, determine how automation can most enhance the studies, and develop explicit and implicit mechanisms to establish trust in end-to-end data processing pipelines and the results they generate. To aid in the platform's development, the research team will focus on the prediction of outcomes from surveys, a specific yet widely applicable type of problem within computational social science. This class of problems involves much subjective assessment during the feature engineering state as well as copious interpretation during the data transformation stage. These unique challenges will benefit both from a collaborative workflow and from mechanisms that enable trust in the eventual results. The project will bring together three distinct teams to develop this platform: computer scientists to develop abstractions, APIs and systems; statisticians to help with methods and study design; and social scientists to help define the problems and workflow and to provide user feedback.

This project has the potential to transform how studies are designed and how data will be processed. The collaborative platform will result in a higher level of trust in the studies conducted via the collaborative curation of study design, procedures, and validation. The collaborative platform also will increase the number of studies that can be done in a short span of time. The platform will be developed as open-source, thereby facilitating interactions with the community and enabling different institutions to install the program.

    This project will develop a collaborative platform that social scientists can use to collaborate and validate each other's studies. The investigative team will attempt to identify the best possible collaborative model for data-driven social science, determine how automation can most enhance the studies, and develop explicit and implicit mechanisms to establish trust in end-to-end data processing pipelines and the results they generate. To aid in the platform's development, the research team will focus on the prediction of outcomes from surveys, a specific yet widely applicable type of problem within computational social science. This class of problems involves much subjective assessment during the feature engineering state as well as copious interpretation during the data transformation stage. These unique challenges will benefit both from a collaborative workflow and from mechanisms that enable trust in the eventual results. The project will bring together three distinct teams to develop this platform: computer scientists to develop abstractions, APIs and systems; statisticians to help with methods and study design; and social scientists to help define the problems and workflow and to provide user feedback.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    America's bridges received a C+ from the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) in 2017. Additionally, the US ranks only 11th world-wide in terms of infrastructure competitiveness. America's infrastructure, particularly its 50-100+ year-old bridges, is in poor health, representing a hidden crisis. Rural areas, due to their lower population density and distance from urban centers, are acutely affected by this crisis, particularly in terms of public safety and economic growth. Limited budgets for planning and maintenance only serve to exacerbate the crisis. To better inform future research, the research team held collaborative conferences and workshops, and conducted stakeholder surveys to identify issues impacting rural bridge health. Outcomes from these activities underscored the value of big data technologies to address the crisis and informed the proposed work. The mission of this multi-institution and multi-sector project is to produce a big data pipeline for rural bridge health management that improves transportation network performance and enhances safety.

    The research team will combine existing and new datasets to address challenges of relevance to bridge owners using scalable and replicable big data pipeline components. Activities will inform bridge owner decision-making by integrating existing datasets and data collected using next-generation health monitoring technologies (e.g., contact and non-contact sensors, unmanned aerial vehicles) with innovative data management techniques. Socio-technical impacts associated with potential decisions will also be assessed. Aging, rural bridge testbeds will be selected in consultation with public and private owners to produce data products that facilitate decision-making and ultimately, provide economical and reliable solutions that improve bridge health. Results from the research will be shared with engineers, owners, and builders at workshops hosted by the research team. Project findings will be disseminated through publications, conferences, meetings, and forums. The research team will engage with the Big Data Hubs and Spokes network to make data, methods, and results available across regions. By extension, project findings will also benefit activities used to monitor and manage other important infrastructure assets, including highways, buildings, power grids, offshore oil platforms, water networks, and other civil infrastructures.

    The scientific community is facing a major challenge dealing with the increasing amount of open scientific data emerging from research projects on all scales--from large facilities to small research labs. Over the last five years the NSF has funded more than 200 high-speed connections to the Internet-2 backbone operating at 10-100Gbps speeds. The goal of this project is to develop a prototype module for a high performance distributed storage system that extends the usability of the existing high-speed interconnects. This project is a pilot for a potential national-scale storage infrastructure for open scientific data, which at full scale could serve hundred sites and many hundreds of Petabytes.  Many of the technologies associated with such a distributed system already exist; the key challenge in this project is social engineering: how can one design a simple enough yet robust storage node that can be easily replicated, is attractive for universities and research projects to adopt, is easy to manage and can support the various patterns for large scale scientific analyses?

    Many universities have several of the necessary pieces for Data Intensive Science in place--reasonably sized computing clusters, a few PB of storage and even a high-speed connection--yet performing the analyses of data intensive science is very painful and slow. Data is never there when needed, large storage systems often fail despite having massive RAID configurations, and moving data from disk-to-disk at the full network speed still requires complex skills. The project offers a broad community buy-in through the Big Data Hubs, a unique combination of skills, facilities and science challenges to test, evaluate and deploy different hardware and software combinations that can be used in the design of a much larger, national-scale system. The goal is to design and run detailed benchmarks for various test science projects requiring different combinations of data transfer, data processing and massive compute, and use the results to design and build a low-cost, scalable petascale appliance including inexpensive hardware nodes and a simple software stack that can be replicated across many universities, supercomputer centers and large NSF facilities. The proposed system could become an enormous multiplier on the existing NSF investments in high end computing and fast networks. It could also accelerate the pace of standardization of data storage across the nation. The public, open data products, often discussed in the Data Management Plans at the end of NSF proposals, could find an easy-to-use home. Various educational projects could simply rely upon a robust storage infrastructure with a simple API and build a variety of delivery services for the educational community.

- abstractText: |-
    There is a growing awareness of the need for multi-center clinical databases and multi-institutional analyses of healthcare data to ensure reproducibility and generalizability of research findings. Single-instance database algorithms are prone to three distinct problems. First, in the context of Big Data science, the size of the data compared to the number of variables makes it difficult to develop complex predictors without overfitting, and more traditional learning algorithms may lead to over-simplified models that do not capture important related influences or interactions between different types of healthcare information. Second, training and testing predictive models on a single database can lead to learning noise or other irrelevant local practices or differences in definitions that are correlated with, but not causally related to, the outcome in question. This leads to models that do not work in other institutions or in the future when practices or the environment changes. Third, sharing data between institutions, and in particular, across borders, is extremely problematic because of trust, legal issues, privacy issues and national policies. The significance of solving these issues is threefold: 1) it would allow the creating of strong generalizable data science models, which leverage enormous pools of data from around the world; 2) it would also allow the identification of rare diseases or patient types, which, as we compile databases, become less rare; and 3) perhaps most importantly, it would allow the free exchange of data science models and generalized approaches to solving medical problems in the cloud.

    This project aims to develop a set of distributed deep learning and cloud computation techniques for cross-institution and cross-border machine learning on health and medical data without the need for protected health information to leave the generating institution. The goals are to create demonstration programs which illustrate feasibility and open source the architecture. The scope of this project encompasses the broad set of machine learning-based tasks multiple institutions may want to apply to their healthcare data in the cloud, as well as the technical issues surrounding transfer learning of knowledge across domains (e.g., institutions/demographics) and tasks (e.g., types of classification and prediction problems). The project has three specific aims: 1) develop a cloud-based infrastructure which preserves regional autonomy of data, but allows the sharing of parameters of the partially trained deep neural network (including weights and hyperparameters) between regions, to allow transfer learning across domains and tasks; 2) develop a standardized coded model for deep learning approaches in medical applications; and 3) evaluate the effect of training and testing the model across multiple centers and national boundaries, by comparing improvement in performance with cross-institutional training without loss of privacy protection, using metrics of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and model calibration. Aims 1-3 will be achieved by taking four databases (including, a database of intensive care unit patients with sepsis, a free text corpus of nursing progress notes, voice recordings taken from a public corpus classically used for speaker identification, and a public database of full-face images used for classification of facial expressions) and placing them in the cloud (Google, AWS and Azure) at different geopolitical locations (namely US and Europe) and developing a distributed deep learning architecture that learns to improve its performance by sharing weights across borders, but not sensitive patient data. This project has the potential to make several contributions to the field. First, it will demonstrate that medical data across geopolitical boundaries can be made available in an interoperable manner (using the FHIR standard) and can be used for training of deep learning algorithms in a privacy-preserving manner, thus addressing both the concerns of Health Insurance, Portability and Privacy Act (HIPPA) and interoperability. Secondly, it will provide open-source deep learning algorithms for several medical datasets and data types that can be used across institutions to solve similar problems with some fine-tuning (e.g., via transfer learning). Third, it will provide a set of open-source meta algorithms for transfer learning (across domains and tasks) implemented on the cloud in containers (dockers) that can be downloaded for local use or transferred across the different cloud vendors.

  title: Leveraging Heterogeneous Data Across International Borders in a Privacy Preserving
    Manner for Clinical Deep Learning
- abstractText: |-
    This International Research Experiences for Students (IRES) project provides funding for 10-week summer research experiences in physical-layer security at the University of Coimbra in Portugal.   Over the three-year project duration, the three yearly unifying topics of student projects will be network protocols for secrecy, intentional jamming techniques for secrecy, and novel error-correcting codes for secrecy in wireless networks. Students will implement projects on a software radio platform where appropriate. The disseminated results will aid system designers in adding a completely new layer of security at the physical-layer of modern networks.

    This project will increase the understanding of physical-layer security for communications in real-world sensor networks.  Over the three-year grant period, fifteen students (including at least twelve undergraduates) will conduct research in Coimbra, Portugal.  The Portuguese research mentors are experts in physical-layer security and coding theory. Stronger collaborations between the universities will develop, leading to advanced results in physical-layer security. The research results may alter secure system design across many platforms to produce modern data security solutions. Recruitment of student participants will be performed at several diverse institutions throughout Southern Colorado, and will allow the development of effective mechanisms for attracting underrepresented groups to STEM research.

- abstractText: "In the past several years, cyber-crime and cyber-breaches have exploded,
    due to the increase in commerce conducted on the Internet, as well as increasing
    quantities of sensitive information being stored in databases that can be accessed
    by outside parties.  In addition, cyber-criminals have advanced, not only employing
    technical acumen but also preying on human error by using sophisticated techniques
    like phishing. To address these challenges, the Northeast Big Data Innovation
    Hub (NEBDIH) will convene two workshops to bring together experts from academia,
    government, and industry in the fields of insurance, cybersecurity, data science,
    and policy. The ultimate goal is to develop a collaborative model (e.g., a cross
    sector consortium) that will help to define the frequency and economic/social
    severity related to successful attacks, and to begin to develop baselines for
    measuring and managing cyber risk more effectively. \n \nNEBDIH will seek to gather
    leading academic, government, risk management, general industry and healthcare
    participants, whose mission will be to identify, quantify, and to help mitigate
    risk associated with cyber-related criminal activity. The workshops will serve
    as a forum for these experts to collaborate on: 1) better understanding and defining
    the interrelated cybersecurity landscape across sectors, and 2) planning for the
    resources necessary to develop baselines for measuring and managing cybersecurity
    risk. Expected outcomes from these activities include developing a framework for
    filling the gaps in quantifying and managing cybersecurity risk across organizations
    and sectors.  This may take the form of an initiative that captures the best  of
    breed technologies, vendors, and best practices; captures a substantial portion
    of the data that is required, in aggregate, to make a cybersecurity risk assessment
    at multiple levels (by industry, by region, by company); provides the tools to
    make the data discoverable and interoperable; and provides a basic suite of tools
    to allow for high level analysis of the data within the context of cybersecurity
    risk."

- abstractText: "The International Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA) is a collaboration of
    astronomers who will use radio telescopes to detect and study gravitational waves,
    a  fundamental prediction of Einstein's theory of general relativity. Gravitational
    waves (GW) from the merger of two stellar-mass black holes were recently detected
    by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO). The IPTA collaboration
    will detect GW from vastly larger and heavier black holes at the cores of merging
    galaxies, via the precise timing of cosmic clocks called radio pulsars. The astronomers
    anticipate that low-frequency GW will be detected within the next five years,
    ushering in a revolution in our understanding of the growth and structure of our
    Universe. U.S. undergraduate and graduate students will be fully involved in all
    aspects of the project. They will collaborate with prominent scientists in different
    countries, play a critical role in one of the potentially transformative scientific
    discoveries of the century, and develop global competencies to succeed in today's
    interconnected world.\n \nThe project will monitor a number of radio pulsars using
    a network of large radio telescopes distributed across the globe, and search for
    small perturbations in the arrival times of pulsar pulses due to low-frequency
    gravitational waves. The IPTA currently consists of consortia from Australia,
    Europe, and North America, using a total of seven telescopes. In order to further
    increase the sensitivity of the IPTA so that it can detect and, ultimately, characterize
    the GW universe, the collaboration will be expanded to include researchers and
    telescopes in China, India, and South Africa. This expansion offers the opportunity
    for U.S. students to gain experience in the development of pulsar timing programs
    in these varied countries. The IRES award will fund two undergraduate students
    and one graduate student to travel to all three countries for 10-week international
    research experiences. The undergraduate students will be drawn from a range of
    U.S. institutions, including minority serving institutions and those in rural
    areas. They will work closely with both a U.S. graduate student also trained in
    IPTA research and their foreign mentor and students in the host country. The students
    will be trained in astrophysics, big data analysis, and radio instrumentation,
    preparing them for a range of careers."

- abstractText: "This project will evaluate sediments deposited 300-million years
    ago in France at a time of abundant ice on the planet. This project will engage
    several teams of undergraduates from underserved populations - particularly indigenous
    peoples of the Plains and Southwest states - in scientific research within a culturally
    sensitive context. A total of 13 students will travel to France over three years
    to conduct field and lab work on red sediments analogous to the types of sediments
    and landscapes familiar to them in the U.S. They will work with both U.S. and
    French scientists in collecting data in both the field and the laboratory, while
    also learning about the history and culture of a part of France with a geologic
    history analogous to that of their homeland. This project will further our understanding
    of how Earth's surface conditions can behave under conditions analogous to the
    present. \n\nThis IRES project will involve three student groups per year undertaking
    fieldwork in France. Students will test the hypothesis that Carboniferous-Permian
    strata of basins preserved near the Central Pangaean Mountains (France) archive
    a record of moderate-elevation glaciation and widespread loess deposits in the
    paleo-tropics. One PhD student and 4 undergraduates per year will participate
    in this project, and students from underserved groups, particularly indigenous
    peoples of the Plains and Southwest states, will be encouraged to participate.
    These students will conduct fieldwork to document facies attributes, including
    detailed grain-size analyses, quartz microtextural, geochemical, and geochronological
    analyses in discrete projects that when merged will test the overarching hypothesis.
    The proposed research will contribute to the experience base and expertise in
    sedimentologic/geochemical/geochronological analyses for all participants, while
    developing datasets and results that will be disseminated largely by student participants.
    Students from the Native populations will be drawn into a foreign experience that
    will widen their horizons, yet simultaneously demonstrate a place-based learning
    wherein stories of past climates are teased from studies of the land. Results
    will provide important constraints on paleoclimate of tropical eastern Pangaea.
    Support of the hypothesis would require a large shift in long-accepted reconstructions
    of climate in eastern Pangaea, whereas a failure of the hypothesis will require
    renewed efforts to understand meridional climate states across central Pangaea.
    The Late Paleozoic Ice Age is Earth?s most recent pre-Quaternary glaciation, and
    thus a common target for climate modelers, using the same models as those employed
    for climate prediction. Hence, calibrations to these models are critical for understanding
    broader aspects of Earth's climate system in both deep- and near-time intervals.
    In summary, the intellectual merit of this project lies in testing hypotheses
    of Earth?s deep-time climate behavior in order to refine our knowledge of Earth's
    climate system, including future states.  The broader impacts include providing
    students of underserved populations research opportunities that will help cultivate
    interest in science and forge new international collaborations."

- abstractText: "The near-surface roof of volcanic systems is often considered geologically
    simple. Lava erupts from depth and flows out at the surface. This project examines
    whether the evolution of the system is more complex, with multiple injections
    of molten rock over time transported vertically and laterally toward and away
    from the central vent of the volcano. Documentation of these patterns could indicate
    that this more complex model may be the norm, leading to a transformative discovery
    of the most abundant volcanic constructs on Earth. The project will also study
    whether primary features of the roots of volcanic systems are often preserved,
    providing a mechanism to track the growth of the deeper parts of the volcanic
    system. At least 15 students from New Mexico Highlands University - a Hispanic
    Serving Institution - and other participating universities - also Hispanic Serving
    Institutions - will study volcanic systems in the Czech Republic to achieve the
    project goal of fully characterizing the anatomy of volcanoes from the deep roots
    to the near-surface roof. Geology graduate and undergraduate students will expand
    their research skills by working collaboratively with an international team of
    geologists. A small team of media arts students from underrepresented backgrounds
    will document the project to share the overall experience of international research
    with a broad audience through public outreach programs. \n\nThrough this 3-year
    project, undergraduate and graduate students will use a unique multidisciplinary
    approach to geologic investigation that involves field- and laboratory-based research
    to better understand and challenge long-standing volcano growth models. While
    building their research experience, the students will advance understanding of
    volcano anatomy. In the Jièín Volcanic Field in the Central Bohemian Paradise
    (Èeský ráj), Czech Republic, natural erosion and quarrying activities from medieval
    times through today have unearthed many volcanoes to expose levels between 100
    m to 4 km below the original surface of the volcano. Teamed with mentors from
    the Czech Republic, France, and Poland students will interpret the magma flow
    pattern, as well as the physical process of dike intrusion, cryptodome formation,
    and magma breakout at the surface. In terms of the roots of the system, students
    will focus on well-exposed, deeply eroded volcanic-plutonic systems near Prague
    and in the northeast Czech Republic. The project team will use methods such as:
    1) primary field observations, structural measurements, sample collection for
    petrology, economic ore genesis, paleomagnetic, and anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility
    analysis; and 2) geophysical surveys to map the subsurface structure. Team experts
    contribute skills sets including physical volcanology, volcanostratigraphy, geochemistry,
    exploration geophysics, magma emplacement mechanics, structural geology, and economic
    ore mineralization. Collectively, these analytical tools will be used to evaluate
    the volcanic system in the field and a laboratory setting. Engaging the skills
    of underrepresented media arts students in documenting the learning and research
    process will contribute to building the next generation of media arts and geology
    students, instilling in them a sense of global competency.\n\nThis project is
    co-funded by the Directorate for Geosciences, Division of Earth Sciences."

    an era defined by interconnected devices embedded in everyday objects that become
    part of everyday activities. Ubiquitous computing, or ubicomp, is a multidisciplinary
    field of study that explores the design and implementation of embedded, networked
    computing devices. Interactions with the computational devices of the developing
    ubicomp world are challenging. Ubicomp researchers explore natural interactions
    with devices, using modalities such as speech, gaze, gestures, and touch. With
    these modes of interaction, the user's focus can remain primarily on the world
    surrounding the device. Human-computer interaction is a central issue in ubicomp,
    and it will be the focus of the work of the IRES students who will conduct research
    at two locations in Germany: at the University of Stuttgart, and at the University
    of Oldenburg. \n\nTechnical Abstract:\nOur research will explore human-computer
    interaction in three areas of ubicomp: in-vehicle interactions, interactions with
    large displays, and interactions with devices on a ship bridge. We will explore
    user interfaces for highly automated vehicles, those that can take over all control
    of the vehicle for extended periods of time, and will signal well in advance when
    the driver needs to resume control. In these future vehicles, drivers will have
    ample time to devote to non-driving tasks. The design of the user interfaces will
    have less to do with the driver?s attention to the road (as is the case in today?s
    vehicles), and more with the physical characteristics of the vehicle (size, seating
    arrangement), the characteristics of the computing environment (network speed,
    quality of sensor readings), and the presence of other people in the vehicle and
    even in other vehicles (collaboration with other passengers, and distractions
    due to the activities of other passengers). Our goal is to explore how context
    should shape the design of in-vehicle user interfaces for automated vehicles.
    In our work with interfaces for ship bridges we will evaluate how to design interfaces
    that keep the human operator?s attention on the relevant interfaces and on the
    outside world, such that the operator can safely navigate the vessel. Our goal
    is to explore how to visualize relevant entities that are outside of the operator?s
    visual focus, and how to guide the operator?s shift of attention towards these
    entities for navigation and decision making. Finally, our work with large displays
    will explore the relationships between the characteristics of the user interfaces
    such as mode of interaction and context awareness, and measures such as user satisfaction,
    task completion time, and task completion quality. Our overarching goal is to
    establish some of these relationships, and use the results to propose improved
    designs of interactions with large displays."

    Talamanca (GREAT) project will use a diverse array of geoscience methods to investigate
    the origins, the current state, and the hazard potential of the Cordillera Talamanca
    (CT) in southern Costa Rica. This region is unique in Central America because
    of its lack of active volcanism, its extreme (and geologically recent) high elevations,
    and its history of unusually distributed large earthquakes. \n\nThe project will
    use resources of the University of Costa Rica: The School of Geology and the civil
    engineering research center (Laboratorio Nacional de Materiales y Modelos Estructurales,
    LanammeUCR,), and also the research facilities of the national power company of
    Costa Rica (Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad, ICE).\n\nOver the course
    of three years, 18 undergraduate students will participate in the project. They
    will collect new data on seismic wave propagation, gravity field strength, and
    the shape of the Earth's surface. They will  merge new observations with existing
    data into a unified knowledge base to increase understanding of the region. They
    will analyze combined data sets to answer specific questions about this region,
    such as \"Why are Cordillera Talamanca so high?\", \"Where are zones of present
    internal deformation?\", and \"What factors control slope stability?\", and use
    newly gained knowledge to assess landslide hazards along the Pan-American highway
    in the CT. \n\nIntegration of the GREAT project into the university-wide Aresty
    Research Assistant program will raise the visibility of Earth Sciences at Rutgers,
    making participation of historically underrepresented groups more likely. Assessment
    of the program's outcomes will be helpful in devising future efforts aimed at
    expanding participation of US diverse student population in natural science research.
    \n\nThe international collaborations forged during the project will establish
    institutional links between a large US public university (Rutgers) and the premier
    research and educational institution in Central America (University of Costa Rica).
    \ \n\n\nTechnical abstract\n\nThe Geoscience REsearch At the Cordillera Talamanca
    (GREAT) research and education project will pursue three distinct research avenues.\n\n1.\tWe
    will study the interior structure of the Cordillera Talamanca region through a
    combination of gravity and seismic methods. Improved constraints on the distribution
    of density will come from a) better gravity data; and b) the integration of additional
    constraints on the geometry and chemistry of Earth's crust. These constraints
    will be inferred from the seismic structure of the Cordillera Talamanca based
    on a combination of methods using body waves from local and distant earthquakes.
    We will use teleseismic receiver function (RF) analysis to probe the structure
    of the crust and the upper mantle, and will take advantage of numerous local and
    regional earthquakes to constrain absolute values of seismic wave speed with textbook
    geophysical exploration techniques such as seismic refraction and wide-angle reflection.
    \ \n\n2.\tWe will study the present-day deformation within the region using regional
    earthquake data from existing and newly deployed seismic observatories.  We will
    work to improve the location of regional seismicity by a) including additional
    data, b) using more advanced tools such as double-difference location, and c)
    using better models of seismic velocity in the Earth.  \n\n3.\tWe will investigate
    the landslide hazard potential for the Pan-American Highway within Cordillera
    Talamanca using remote sensing data and direct geological observations. We will
    use unmanned drones and land-based LiDAR to build highly detailed digital elevation
    models, and will combine them with microgravity surveys and background information
    on geology and seismic activity to develop case studies of landslide potential.\n\nDuring
    each of 3 years of the project a six-person cohort of undergraduate students will
    spend 6 weeks in Costa Rica, working with mentors from research institutions in

- abstractText: "This project will collect baseline ecological data to record the
    response of a degraded tropical forest in the Bornean highlands to the introduction
    of an agroforestry system. The highlands were returned to indigenous (Kadazan)
    persons in Malaysian Borneo following two clear-cuttings over the last century;
    and the agroforestry system is designed to restore the forest canopy. Eleven undergraduate
    and two Master of Science students from underrepresented groups in STEM disciplines
    will collect data in paid 8-week summer ecological field research experiences.
    Data include soil properties (organic matter, chemical content, pH, water holding
    capacity, fungi to bacteria ratio), arthropod diversity (beetles, ants and butterflies)
    and fructivorous and insectivorous bat communities. \n\nThe data record ecological
    changes at producer sites and will be compared to sites at the same elevation
    in an adjacent and protected national forest range for ecological benchmarking.
    \ Benchmarking serves to help qualify agroforestry practices for international
    green product labelling, which would substantially elevate producer incomes. Results
    will improve scientific understanding of the linkages among ecological communities
    in tropical forests from soil to canopy; and, finally, students will gain professional

    of three environmental fluid mechanics project areas using field measurements,
    physical modeling, and numerical methods: 1) Coastal hazard mitigation ecosystem

    and management that stretch across national boundaries.  The field of water engineering
    requires a broader educational approach beyond traditional curricula, as today's
    water engineers face challenging and interdisciplinary issues that combine concepts
    and methods beyond existing theories and data and instead require a research focus.
    \ In addition to the water engineering research component, this IRES program will

    Materials innovation is a pipeline, deriving from a deep understanding and control of material behavior and properties, leading to advanced materials designs that advance economic prosperity, address national and regional energy needs, and bolster national security. Improving this pipeline requires connecting independent but thematically congruent national and regional materials design efforts to align key stakeholders, consolidate diverse materials data expertise, simplify data access, coalesce on topics of data description and interoperability, enhance and ensure the quality of datasets, and deploy scalable data services to support materials researchers. The Midwest Big Data Spoke (MBD Spoke) for Integrative Materials Design (IMaD) connects researchers in industry, universities, and government to the people and services needed to easily find, access, and use data, tools, and services for materials design. The Midwest is the ideal place for such a program. Many major national materials design efforts funded by DOE, NIST, and NSF as part of the Materials Genome Initiative (MGI) operate in the Midwest, and the Midwest is home to major manufacturing industries that depend critically on materials innovation for their continued competitiveness.

    The technical work of IMaD will involve integration of software and services from across the Midwest and beyond, including the Materials Commons, the Materials Data Facility, NIST Materials Resource Registry, and Citrine Informatics, to enable smooth flow of software and data among these different systems. For example, integrated authentication provided by Globus Auth will enable access to different components with common credentials (e.g., institutional credentials), and integration of Globus transfer will allow for rapid and reliable exchange of large datasets. Common schemas and metadata terms will be developed and deployed to permit cross-system searching and display of information. Materials data from partners across the Midwest and beyond will be loaded into the Material Data Facility to permit easy discovery and access. Concurrently with these and other development activities, a series of workshops and meetings will be convened to engage academic, government, and industry participants in defining requirements for, and making use of, the integrated system for materials design.

    promoting mutual understandings between the two nations.\n \nThe aim of the project
    is to give U.S. students international research experiences under the mentorship
    of a prominent Uzbek mathematician, Shavkat Ayupov, a well-known expert in Leibniz
    algebras. The PI will take three separate cohorts to Uzbekistan, 15 to 21 U.S.
    students over three years, to conduct research for two months at the Institute
    of Mathematics of the National University of Uzbekistan. The U.S. students will
    join Ayupov's research group and conduct research in collaboration with their
    Uzbek peers and mentors on topics of current interest in Leibniz algebras. Examples
    of research topics include studying properties of derivations of Leibniz algebras
    and identifying solvable rigid Leibniz algebras. The Leibniz algebras, which are
    generalizations of Lie algebras, are an important and rapidly developing area
    of mathematics with applications in general relativity, quantum mechanics and
    string theory. It is expected for each research project to result in publications
    and lead to further research collaboration. In addition to their research activities,
    the students will also take short courses on the language, culture and traditions
    of Uzbekistan to help them adjust to their surroundings. During their stay in
    Uzbekistan, the U.S. students will travel to the ancient cities of Samarkand,
    Bukhara and Khiva to learn about the cultural and scientific heritage of Uzbekistan."

    This project will support teachers, administrators and researchers to collaborate around online education resources and big data. It will increase the capacity of participants in Educational Big Data in the Northeast to analyze data from schools, students and administrators and to improve teaching and learning. However, as more refined data comes from online instructional systems and the use of data mining techniques, participants will learn to search for patterns and associations and to draw conclusions about student knowledge, performance and behavior. This research addresses several grand challenges in education: 1) Predict future student events, e.g., college attendance, college major, from existing large-scale longitudinal educational data sets involving the same thousands of students. 2) Help teachers to make sense of dense online data to influence their teaching, e.g., what should they say or do in response to student activity. 3) Provide personal instruction to each student based on using big data that represents student skills and behavior and infers students' cognitive, motivational, and metacognitive factors in learning. The project will improve the capacity in data-driven education by sharing educational databases, managing yearly data competitions, and conducting educational data science workshops and hackathons. Measurable results include studying gigabytes of data to: create actionable recommendations for classroom teachers; make effective and successful predictions about students; develop new AI methods for education; and create new data science tool sets. Key outcomes include introducing many researchers to educational big data, learning analytics and models of teaching interventions. The team intends to improve classroom learning and leverage the unique types of data available from digital education to better understand students, groups and the settings in which they learn.

    Computers have been in classrooms for decades and yet educators have not identified the most effective ways of using them. Despite advances in evaluation methods to measure human learning, most researchers still use measures available 50 years ago. This project will leverage and extend state-of-the-art big data bases and technologies to measure online learning, especially features of student engagement and learning associated with improved student outcome. This project has the potential to reach millions of students (while learning), hundreds of researchers while measuring human learning (from education, cognitive science, learning sciences, psychology, and computer science) and a dozen other organizations (publishers, testing organizations, non-profit organizations, teachers, parents, and stakeholders). The team brings together a unique blend of researchers from data science (Baker, Heffernan); adaptive education technology and computer science (Woolf, Arroyo); and learning sciences (Arroyo, Heffernan). It includes women and minorities (Woolf, Arroyo), people who helped develop the largest educational database in the world (Baker), developers of data science teaching materials (Arroyo, Baker), and others who have developed online tutoring systems that achieve significant student success in learning (e.g., Heffernan, Arroyo, Woolf).

    The Digital Agriculture Spoke of the Midwest Big Data Hub seeks to organize academic, industrial, and governmental sectors around the development of policies and best practices for data science and Big Data applications in agriculture, with a particular focus on automating the Big Data lifecycle for unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) and for plant sciences, phenomics, and genomics. This effort is necessitated by the projected growth in the global population (9.5 billion people by 2050), which will require the global agricultural workforce to produce 70% more food than our farmers do today. Historically, agricultural revolutions in cultivation, social organization, and industrialization have provided the means to increase food production. However, future revolutions must leverage the advantages provided by the modern information society. This project will serve as a catalyst for this data-driven revolution, which will be broad and societal in nature and address the triple-bottom line of being economically viable, socially acceptable, and environmentally sensible. Whereas the initial focus areas are specific, the resulting best practices and partnership-building will translate to and enable other areas such as remote sensing systems and farm management techniques.  An expected outcome is improved and efficient use of UAS, imaging, and genomics in agricultural sciences, ultimately leading to a more sustainable global food and nutrition system. Coordination of these activities will be enhanced through a Digital Agriculture open web portal of data science resources, designed to integrate existing information silos, facilitate collaboration, and contribute to workforce development. Educational activities and tools will be leveraged from pre-existing traineeship programs and collaborative entities, and broadened with newly developed annual workshops. Special issue-teams of academic, industrial, and governmental representatives will be used to conduct deep-learning analysis of project educational activities to identify and refine mechanisms for broadening and diversifying participation. Through these efforts, the collaboration will improve access to data assets, train a workforce with relevant skills and expertise, and will contribute to solving the Sustainable Global Food and Nutrition Security challenge.

    This project will focus on two knowledge domains important to agriculture, UAS, and Plant Sciences. These two themes of Intellectual Merit will be melded with cross-cutting activities designed to improve the management, accessibility, automation, and value of the lifecycle for data that are generated by multiple, high-throughput sensor and measurement platforms in contexts related to agriculture and agriculture production. Best practices for transport, storage, dissemination, and analysis of Big Data will be translatable and scalable to other areas such as farm management systems and precision agriculture, and will enable the access to and use of valuable data assets related to UAS and plant sciences, thereby accelerating progress toward sustainable agricultural production. Many of the ideas and methods developed under this project and the partnership-building activities that link multiple public institutions and private entities will be transferable to other disciplines that require Big Data, such as transportation, health sciences, and food, energy, and water, and will therefore generate innovation and discovery from many and complex data resources. One aspect of these partnerships is the desire to build a workforce with strong data science skillsets. To accomplish this, project activities include participation by undergraduate, graduate, and early career scientists in annual meetings, Zoom events, and webinars. Interested participants from the academic, industrial, and governmental sectors will be supported and encouraged to engage in cutting-edge research and development areas such as direct data collection of plant features by UAS, biological feature extraction through image analysis, Big Data processing pipelines, and techniques for data management and sharing. Diversity of innovation related to UAS and Plant Sciences will be encouraged through a suite of issue teams who analyze in-person and web-based trainings, goal-oriented Meetups, and conference events for diversity using deep learning techniques. These modalities for deep learning were selected for their scalability and improved access by underrepresented groups. The project has a heavy emphasis on workforce training and best practices. Workshops and webinars, including hackathons and datathons, will help both students and people already in the workforce expand their professional development.

    together with partnerships in academia, industry, and government at multiple levels.
    The Big Data Neuroscience Spoke titled Midwest: Advanced Computational Neuroscience
    Network (ACNN) is strongly aligned with the national priority area of neuroscience
    and brings together a diverse set of committed regional partners to enable the
    Midwest region to realize the promise of Big Data for neuroscience. The ACNN Spoke
    will build broad consensus on the core requirements, infrastructure, and components
    needed to develop a new generation of sustainable interdisciplinary Neuroscience
    Big Data research. ACNN will leverage the strengths and resources in the Midwest
    region to increase innovation and collaboration for the understanding of the structure,
    physiology, and function of the human brain through partnerships and services
    in education, tools, and best practices. \n\nThe ACNN will design, pilot and support
    powerful neuroscientific computational resources for high-throughput, collaborative,
    and service-oriented data aggregation, processing and open-reproducible science.
    The ACNN Spoke framework will address three specific problems related to neuroscience
    Big Data: (1) data capture, organization, and management involving multiple centers
    and research groups, (2) quality assurance, preprocessing and analysis that incorporates
    contextual metadata, and (3) data communication to software and hardware computational
    resources that can scale with the volume, velocity, and variety of neuroscience
    datasets. The ACNN will build a sustainable ecosystem of neuroscience community
    partners in both academia and industry using existing technologies for collaboration
    and virtual meeting together with face-to-face group meetings. The planned activities
    of the ACNN Spoke will also allow the Midwest Big Data Hub to disseminate additional
    Big Data technologies resources to the neuroscience community, including access
    to supercomputing facilities, best practices, and platforms.\n\nThis award received
    co-funding from CISE Divisions of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure (ACI) and Information
    and Intelligent Systems (IIS)."

    This project brings together six universities to design and construct a patient-focused and personalized health system that addresses the fractured nature of healthcare information, and the lack of engagement of individuals in their own healthcare. By taking advantage of the enormous amount of information being created about our environment, through the confluence of real-time, mobile and wearable devices and the availability of rich social media data on patient behavior, the team will create a detailed and comprehensive picture of a patient's health, and a tool to help manage patients' engagement with their health care providers. The system has four key aims to: (1) provide a human-centered approach for integrating electronic health record data generated by traditional methods with data collected "in the wild" (such as personal fitness devices, mobile phone usage, local weather, pollution or even fast food restaurant maps, etc.); (2) develop a framework for deciding which data sources are trustworthy; (3) create a cloud-based system to allow users to view and track their own data over time and improve healthcare outcomes; and (4) provide educational outreach and community participation, particularly in minority populations, to design a system which benefits users in both the short term (through employment and education) and the long term (through increased engagement and trust).

    This project will leverage modern distributed cloud-based computing infrastructure (including mobile phones and Amazon Web Services), and the unique capacities of the South BD Hub to house and analyze the enormous volumes of health-related data that are generated every day by people, and their environment. By linking electronic medical records, external databases and data 'in the wild' harvested from patient's Internet-enabled devices, the project will address several issues related to the integration of high-resolution data for longitudinal tracking of patients. These include acceptability of the technology, particularly by vulnerable groups, usability, veracity of data collected, and scalability/integration across a large heterogeneous landscape.  By employing patient-centric agile development, the team will work with communities to implement a cloud-based architecture to improve tracking of study participants, increase the ease with which data can be captured, improve patient engagement, and facilitate care coordination. The resultant platform will integrate big data analytics, real time scalable data collection, and social media analytics on patient behavior to analyze cardiovascular disease outcomes among disadvantaged African American and Hispanic patient populations.  Additionally, the team will implement data fusion techniques to ensure the veracity of the varying qualities of data collected, and develop machine learning models to identify at-risk patient populations in order to reduce health disparities. Finally, patient engagement and health outcomes will be measured to assess the validity and success of the system.

    Vast quantities of health, environmental, and behavioral data are being generated today, yet they remain locked in digital silos. For example, data from health care providers, such as hospitals, provide a dynamic view of health of individuals and populations from birth to death. At the same time, government institutions and industry have released troves of economic, environmental, and behavioral datasets, such as indicators of income/poverty, adverse exposure (e.g., air pollution), and ecological factors (e.g., climate) to the public domain. How are economic, environmental, and behavioral factors linked with health? This project will put together numerous sources of large environmental and clinical data streams to enable the scientific community to address this question. By breaking current data silos, the broader scientific impacts will be wide. First, this effort will foster new routes of biomedical investigation for the big data community. Second, the project will enable discoveries that will have behavioral, economic, environmental, and public health relevance.

    This project will aim to assemble a first-ever data warehouse containing numerous health/clinical, environmental, behavioral, and economic data streams to ultimately enable causal discovery between these data sources. First, the team will integrate numerous health data streams by leveraging the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI, www.ohdsi.org) network, a virtual data repository that contains millions of longitudinal patient measurements, such as drugs and disease diagnoses. Second, the team will build a centralized data warehouse that contains important environmental, behavioral, and economic data across the United States, such as the Environmental Protection Agency air pollution AirData, the United States Census data on income and occupation statistics, and the National Oceanic Administration Association for climate and weather-related information. Third, the team will disseminate emerging computational methods for causal inference and machine learning to enable researchers to find causal links between environmental, economic, behavioral, and clinical factors. The team will leverage our broad collaborative network consisting of academic big data researchers, federal-level institutes (e.g., EPA, NOAA), and hospitals (e.g., Partners HealthCare) to integrate these data and to disseminate cutting edge machine learning tools. Lastly, the project will create training resources (e.g., interactive how-to guides), coordinate cross-institution student internships, and lead a hands-on workshop to demonstrate use of the integrated data warehouse. The ultimate goal of the project is to facilitate community-led and collaborative causal discovery through dissemination of integrated and open big data and analytics tools.

    The MetroInsight project is building an end to end system for knowledge discovery from real-time data streams collected through a variety of sensors, data collection and aggregation methods.  These data streams are highly dimensional with multiple sensors observing same or similar phenomena over multiple sensory spectrums and scales. These are also sometimes real-time and/or have strong timing relationships that is necessary to support metropolitan infrastructure through effective analytics and policy support. The project brings together a diverse number of partners utilities, universities, companies and cities with the ability to contribute novel tools and urban sensor data and to translate knowledge into actions. MetroInsight's unique combination of tools, data and partnerships, in part with the MetroLab Network , makes it well poised to set an example for the MetroLab programs across the nation as well as the rest of the municipal governments. The project will explore connections between multimodal datasets and urban infrastructure management to build a practical system consisting of integrated tools, as well as training a new generation of metropolitan workforce. As part of an ambitious plan for community building and workforce development, the project includes creation of new learning modules, certification programs on energy and sustainability, an online courses on sensor data analytics and new capstone projects in a new Data Science master's degree program.

    To achieve project goals, MetroInsight is building infrastructure for managing data, networks and processing that will support design of new algorithms and tools in the project. Specifically, the project is developing algorithms to transform multimodal urban data to a lower dimensional data that reflects underlying physical and social phenomena. These low dimensional data may consist of population level data suitable for dynamic processing to support real time monitoring and visualization by cityscale operators of various lifelines from transportation, communications to emergency response. To address technical challenges in complex and subtle spatiotemporal dynamics of interdependent urban networks, MetroInsight will develop metadata methods and tools that support discovery of operational interdependencies, quantification of uncertainties for decision support and to provide assurances related to integrity and security of data, compliance related to ethical and legal privacy expectations.

    Sharing of data sets can provide tremendous mutual benefits for industry, researchers and nonprofit organizations. For example, companies can profit from the fact that university researchers explore their data sets and make discoveries, which help the company to improve their business. At the same time, researchers are always on the search for real world data sets to show that their newly developed techniques work in practice. Unfortunately, many attempts to share relevant data sets between different stakeholders in industry and academia fail or require a large investment to make data sharing possible. A major obstacle is that data often comes with prohibitive restrictions on how it can be used (requiring e.g., the enforcement of legal terms or other policies, handling data privacy issues, etc.). In order to enforce these requirements today, lawyers are usually involved in negotiation the terms of each contract. It is not atypical that this process of creating an individual contract for data sharing ends up in protracted negotiations, which are both disconnected from what the actual stakeholders aim to do and fraught as both sides struggle with the implications and possibilities of modern security, privacy, and data sharing techniques. Worse, fear of missing a loophole in how the data might be (mis)used often prevents many data sharing efforts from even getting off the ground. To address these challenges, our new data sharing spoke will enable data providers to easily share data while enforcing constraints on the use of the data. This effort has two key components:(1) Creating a licensing model for data that facilitates sharing data that is not necessarily open or free between different organizations and (2) Developing a prototype data sharing software platform, ShareDB, which enforces the terms and restrictions of the developed licenses. We believe these efforts will have a transformative impact on how data sharing takes place. By moving data out of the silos of individuals and single organizations and into the hands of broader society, we can tackle many societally significant problems.

    This new data sharing spoke will enable data providers to easily share data while enforcing constraints on the use of the data. Many services and platforms that provide access to data sets exist already today. However, these platforms generally promote completely open access and do not address the aforementioned issues that arise when dealing with proprietary data. Thus, the effort has three key components: (1) Creating a licensing model for data that facilitates sharing data that is not necessarily open or free between different organizations and (2) developing a prototype data sharing software platform, ShareDB, which enforces the terms and restrictions of the developed licenses, and (3) developing and integrating relevant metadata that will accompany the datasets shared under the different licenses, making them easily searchable and interpretable. To ensure that the developed tools and licenses are useful, the project will form the Northeast Data Sharing Group, comprising of many different stakeholders to make the licensing model widely accepted and usable in many application domains (e.g., health and finance). The intellectual merit of this proposal is to design a licensing model and a data sharing platform that is widely accepted and usable as a template in many different domains. While there exist other efforts to enable data sharing (e.g., Creative Commons), they focus on the case where the data owner is willing to openly share the data on the Internet. This licensing model and the ecosystem is different since it allows data owners to enforce certain requirements stated in a data sharing agreement (e.g., on who is allowed to access the data) and also provides tools to make data sharing of sensitive information safe. The licenses and software we propose to investigate will make it easier for organizations to open up their data to the appropriate organizations, while maintaining the ability to ensure it is protected, that access is revocable, and that access controls and audit logs are maintained.

It is not atypical that this process of creating an individual contract for data sharing ends up in protracted negotiations, which are both disconnected from what the actual stakeholders aim to do and fraught as both sides struggle with the implications and possibilities of modern security, privacy, and data sharing techniques. Worse, fear of missing a loophole in how the data might be (mis)used often prevents many data sharing efforts from even getting off the ground. To address these challenges, our new data sharing spoke will enable data providers to easily share data while enforcing constraints on the use of the data. This effort has two key components:(1) Creating a licensing model for data that facilitates sharing data that is not necessarily open or free between different organizations and (2) Developing a prototype data sharing software platform, ShareDB, which enforces the terms and restrictions of the developed licenses. We believe these efforts will have a transformative impact on how data sharing takes place. By moving data out of the silos of individuals and single organizations and into the hands of broader society, we can tackle many societally significant problems.

    This new data sharing spoke will enable data providers to easily share data while enforcing constraints on the use of the data. Many services and platforms that provide access to data sets exist already today. However, these platforms generally promote completely open access and do not address the aforementioned issues that arise when dealing with proprietary data. Thus, the effort has three key components: (1) Creating a licensing model for data that facilitates sharing data that is not necessarily open or free between different organizations and (2) developing a prototype data sharing software platform, ShareDB, which enforces the terms and restrictions of the developed licenses, and (3) developing and integrating relevant metadata that will accompany the datasets shared under the different licenses, making them easily searchable and interpretable. To ensure that the developed tools and licenses are useful, the project will form the Northeast Data Sharing Group, comprising of many different stakeholders to make the licensing model widely accepted and usable in many application domains (e.g., health and finance). The intellectual merit of this proposal is to design a licensing model and a data sharing platform that is widely accepted and usable as a template in many different domains. While there exist other efforts to enable data sharing (e.g., Creative Commons), they focus on the case where the data owner is willing to openly share the data on the Internet. This licensing model and the ecosystem is different since it allows data owners to enforce certain requirements stated in a data sharing agreement (e.g., on who is allowed to access the data) and also provides tools to make data sharing of sensitive information safe. The licenses and software we propose to investigate will make it easier for organizations to open up their data to the appropriate organizations, while maintaining the ability to ensure it is protected, that access is revocable, and that access controls and audit logs are maintained.

    Sharing of data sets can provide tremendous mutual benefits for industry, researchers and nonprofit organizations. For example, companies can profit from the fact that university researchers explore their data sets and make discoveries, which help the company to improve their business. At the same time, researchers are always on the search for real world data sets to show that their newly developed techniques work in practice. Unfortunately, many attempts to share relevant data sets between different stakeholders in industry and academia fail or require a large investment to make data sharing possible. A major obstacle is that data often comes with prohibitive restrictions on how it can be used (e.g., requiring the enforcement of legal terms or other policies, handling data privacy issues, etc.). In order to enforce these requirements today, lawyers are usually involved in negotiation the terms of each contract.

    Poor use of data in the public sector, in general, have been linked to lack of resources and the lack of political will necessary for more efficient and effective use of data. This is troubling, given the potential of big data to increase the transparency of government decision making to all those impacted by policy implementation. Criminal Justice is one field shifting its practices in an attempt to make its decision making process more transparent to community residents, particularly with the use of community oriented policing (COP).  Recent headlines demonstrate the urgent need for police departments to build and maintain trust with their communities through greater transparency and effectiveness.  Data, when used to augment police services in a transparent fashion, has been shown to lead to heightened levels of community trust and reduce negative interactions between police officers and community members. This planning grant project seeks to identify the challenges and opportunities of utilizing big data in the criminal justice system, specifically in COP through the identification and creation of key stakeholder teams, or nodes, and a systematic participatory process with three workshops designed to elicit information, data needs, and challenges and opportunities for the viability of big data and community policing in the Western US. At the completion of the project, the team and nodes will have identified a list of concrete and systemic opportunities for utilizing big data for policing.

    The use of big data in the criminal justice system has the potential to address this problem by augmenting COP practices through increased efficiency in resource allocation.  The intellectual merit gained from this planning grant will further link big data and criminal justice by identifying systematic obstacles from diverse sectors to adopting big data strategies.  Technological innovations such as big data are often misunderstood or misapplied by policy makers, and the general public. Because of its participatory nature, this planning grant has the opportunity to more broadly impact society by engaging and informing a diverse audience around the conversation of big data. The project team also hopes to reach underrepresented groups associated with the science of big data and policy decision-making.

- abstractText: "Security and privacy play a key role in areas such as health, energy,
    and smart cities, as well as constituting a grand challenge in and of themselves.
    \ Privacy and security are critical for realizing Big Data's promise to advance
    society.  If data are used without regard to privacy of individuals or protection
    of the data, then individuals may be hurt.  If the data's authenticity is not
    guaranteed, or if data are not permitted to be used at all due to privacy and
    security concerns, then the data's value is not realized. As the information that
    is collected about us grows in quantity, scientific and commercial value, and
    sensitivity, addressing these challenges is crucial to accessing the benefits
    of big data while ensuring that privacy and associated basic rights such as free
    speech and association are respected.   Through two workshops hosted by DIMACS,
    this planning project will advance the research agenda on privacy and security
    for big data, build a community of interested researchers and practitioners, and
    propose regional activities in security and privacy related to the Northeast Big
    Data Hub.  The long-term vision of the project is to catalyze both foundational
    and practical advances in privacy and security for big data that have the ability
    to positively impact society by (1) expanding the extent to which individuals
    can have control over protection of their personal data, and (2) enabling data's
    value to be harnessed for advances in areas including health, energy, smart cities
    and regions, finance, and education. \n\nThe first event, a workshop on \"Overcoming
    Barriers to Data Sharing including Privacy and Fairness\", will bring together
    computer scientists, legal scholars, social scientists, and consumers of data
    to understand the extent to which privacy currently limits the sharing of data,
    including but not limited to research data, and to develop standards and best
    practices to enable new information flows in domains from healthcare to energy.
    \ The second event, the \"NE BD Hub Workshop on Privacy and Security for Big Data\",
    will bring together privacy and security experts as well as experts in a variety
    of big data application areas to highlight privacy and security issues associated
    with each of the Northeast Big Data hub spokes.  Expected project outcomes include
    broad participation, development of new collaborations and partnerships, production
    and dissemination of tutorial and talk videos, and reports on planned activities
    and potential best practices.\n\nThis award is co-funded by the CISE Division
    of Computer and Network Systems (CNS) Secure and Trustworthy Computing (SaTC)

    This project will support teachers, administrators and researchers to collaborate around online education resources and big data. It will increase the capacity of participants in Educational Big Data in the Northeast to analyze data from schools, students and administrators and to improve teaching and learning. However, as more refined data comes from online instructional systems and the use of data mining techniques, participants will learn to search for patterns and associations and to draw conclusions about student knowledge, performance and behavior. This research addresses several grand challenges in education: 1) Predict future student events, e.g., college attendance, college major, from existing large-scale longitudinal educational data sets involving the same thousands of students. 2) Help teachers to make sense of dense online data to influence their teaching, e.g., what should they say or do in response to student activity. 3) Provide personal instruction to each student based on using big data that represents student skills and behavior and infers students' cognitive, motivational, and metacognitive factors in learning. The project will improve the capacity in data-driven education by sharing educational databases, managing yearly data competitions, and conducting educational data science workshops and hackathons. Measurable results include studying gigabytes of data to: create actionable recommendations for classroom teachers; make effective and successful predictions about students; develop new AI methods for education; and create new data science tool sets. Key outcomes include introducing many researchers to educational big data, learning analytics and models of teaching interventions. The team intends to improve classroom learning and leverage the unique types of data available from digital education to better understand students, groups and the settings in which they learn.

    Computers have been in classrooms for decades and yet educators have not identified the most effective ways of using them. Despite advances in evaluation methods to measure human learning, most researchers still use measures available 50 years ago. This project will leverage and extend state-of-the-art big data bases and technologies to measure online learning, especially features of student engagement and learning associated with improved student outcome. This project has the potential to reach millions of students (while learning), hundreds of researchers while measuring human learning (from education, cognitive science, learning sciences, psychology, and computer science) and a dozen other organizations (publishers, testing organizations, non-profit organizations, teachers, parents, and stakeholders). The team brings together a unique blend of researchers from data science (Baker, Heffernan); adaptive education technology and computer science (Woolf, Arroyo); and learning sciences (Arroyo, Heffernan). It includes women and minorities (Woolf, Arroyo), people who helped develop the largest educational database in the world (Baker), developers of data science teaching materials (Arroyo, Baker), and others who have developed online tutoring systems that achieve significant student success in learning (e.g., Heffernan, Arroyo, Woolf).

    and institutional ecologies of today?s research and scientific infrastructure.
    \ This project will investigate the ongoing activities at the BDHubs and its partner
    institutions, their emerging plans for the future, and tie these to the long-history
    of developing research infrastructures (50+ years) to understand the changes we
    can expect BDHubs to encounter over time (scientific, technological and institutional),
    and what strategies they employ in the face of transformations to the landscape
    of science, information technology and institutional environment. \n\nMany challenges
    facing contemporary science such as environmental research or chronic disease
    management require long-term studies and supporting infrastructures. This project
    will contribute directly to NSF and other efforts to build more open, effective,
    and sustainable knowledge communities across the sciences, industry and government.
    Improving understanding of the long-term trajectory of research infrastructure
    will lead to smarter and more sustainable investment and design choices on the
    part of project leaders, participants, tool builders, and funders. Many other
    science agencies are in the midst of funding such cross-cutting projects. This
    research will inform science policy and regulatory environments to help develop
    sustainable and productive research infrastructures. In order to do so, this study
    will develop a general organizational understanding of the development of large-scale
    and long-term endeavors in the data sciences and map the institutional landscape
    of modern data science with particular focus on the activities of infrastructure
    building, policy development and community formation. In addition, this study
    will help to develop an understanding of the ?rise of the data sciences? in the
    US both as an institutional movement and as a form of technical research, with
    special focus on establishing a framework for evaluating and understanding large-scale,
    cross-disciplinary collaboration on big data tools, techniques and methods."

- abstractText: "This proposal focuses on providing international educational and
    research opportunities in geosciences for US students and underrepresented minorities
    in a non-traditional study abroad destination, in this case Ethiopia. Only 4%
    of international undergraduate student research experiences are in Africa. Recent
    research has documented the benefits of these international experiences including:
    increased knowledge of other cultures, world geography, cultural relativism, and
    global interdependence. Students in general show increasing enthusiasm about problems
    of global importance that have practical consequences and are strongly attracted
    to interdisciplinary courses, especially those of societal relevance. The collaborations
    in this proposal will aid the effort of developing a globally engaged workforce
    in the US and provide the opportunity for students to tackle problems of global
    magnitude as members of the world community. This project can have a significant
    impact on the participation of U.S. students in geosciences education and research
    at both participating U.S. institutions. We expect that students participating
    in the international study, research training program and field experience abroad
    will acquire knowledge and research skills in geosciences and will be encouraged
    to pursue academic and/or industrial careers in these areas. The scientists and
    students at North Carolina A&T University (NCA&T) and in Ethiopia are benefiting
    from the collaboration, as they are now developing long lasting relationships
    that create the conditions for joint global projects. \n\nEthiopia serves as an
    ideal natural laboratory for training US students in the geosciences. The main
    Ethiopian Rift and the Afar Depression region is the only location on earth, other
    than Iceland, where the transition from continental to oceanic rift is being studied.
    The East African Rift System crossing through Ethiopia is one the geologic wonders
    of the world, a place where the earth's tectonic forces are presently trying to
    create new plates by splitting apart old ones.  Ethiopia and sub-Saharan Africa
    is also home to some of the highest levels of atmospheric aerosols from biomass-burning
    (BB) and BB is believed to be a major driver of regional carbon, energy, and water
    cycles. Selected IRES students will work alongside research mentors from NCA&T,
    Addis Ababa University (AAU) and Appalachian State University (ASU) and student
    researchers from AAU to (1) conduct geophysics research including exploring geothermal
    energy and groundwater sources; (2) initiate long-term measurements of atmospheric
    aerosols in Addis Ababa; and (3) conduct laboratory-based studies of BB aerosol
    optical properties (4) apply Fourier Transform spectroscopic techniques to develop
    carbon monoxide (CO) emission inventories. The proposed activities build upon
    existing research capabilities at the three universities and collaborations between
    NCA&T and AAU, which have involved numerous US undergraduates in international
    research experiences. The research experiences will be conducted in a region of
    the world that serves as an ideal natural geoscience laboratory (Earth and atmospheric
    sciences) and which has traditionally been neglected for international student
    research opportunities. U.S. student participants will work alongside AAU students
    and faculty researchers who are leaders in their field on interdisciplinary geoscience
    projects that will instill Earth system science approach and have societal implications,
    including geothermal energy, water resources, plate tectonics, and relationships
    between regional air quality and climate change."

    Mohan Sankaran\nCase Western Reserve University\n\n\nThis International Research
    Experiences for Students (IRES) program will provide an international research
    experience at the Lanzhou University in China for four students from the United
    States each year.   The intellectual merit of the work is to advance the scientific
    understanding of electrostatic charging in granular systems, both generally and
    specifically for the case of wind-blown dust.  Electrostatic charging of granular
    systems is ubiquitous and has important consequences in both industrial and natural
    processes, but is very poorly understood.  The impressive facilities at Lanzhou
    University, which include a wind-tunnel and a desert research station, offer a
    unique opportunity to carry out studies in a controlled but realistic environment
    and increase our understanding of particle charging in wind-blown systems. The
    broader impact of the program is to train US students in research with a global
    perspective; China is an ideal location for such a program, as the country has
    become a worldwide leader in industry, commerce and scientific research.  \n\nThe
    specific goals of the study will be to carry out measurements of particle fluxes,
    particle size distributions, and particle charge distributions as a function of
    elevation in wind-blown dust systems.  We will also measure electric fields as
    a function of elevation which will allow us to compare with previous studies,
    and correlate with particle flux, size and charging  On one hand, we aim to understand
    how these electrostatic effects vary with parameters such as wind speed, overall
    particle size distribution, and humidity, and on the other hand how the electrostatic
    effects arise in natural conditions and what their consequences may be on dust
    migration. Our strategy will be to: (a) develop and validate methodology in laboratory
    scale experiments; (b) carry out well-controlled large scale wind tunnel experiments,
    where wind speed and direction, as well as other relevant parameters (e.g., particle
    size distribution, humidity), can be controlled; and (c) carry out field experiments
    in the desert, where the conditions (wind speed and direction, humidity, etc.)
    are not controlled and will vary significantly during the course of the experimentation,
    but where the results are most meaningful in regard to environmental and climatic
    implications.  Students will work in interdisciplinary teams, serving in different
    roles throughout the project from designing experiments to carrying out field
    studies, and analyzing data."

    these topics by focusing research on the development of novel, smart materials
    for alternative energy sources and new methods of water purification using solar
    energy.  The project will increase the number of future U.S. workers who can understand
    and solve these important issues while increasing their ability to partner with
    international researchers who are also interested in these topics. This US-Polish
    International Research Experience for Students (IRES) project provides eight-week,
    photochemistry and nanotechnology research opportunity for twelve US students
    at Warsaw University, Poland. Specific efforts will be made ensuring the involvement
    of underprivileged and underrepresented in STEM minorities. Prior to their internships
    in Poland, students will spend the academic year working in research laboratory
    at Adelphi University developing essential technical skills relevant to the proposed
    research. This early-career research experience will enhance the professional
    training and education of the US undergraduate students by exposing them to modern
    instrumentation, advanced nanotechnology research, and its practical application.
    IRES students will develop global competencies through experiential education
    in an international environment motivating and inspiring young US researchers
    to invest in future research careers and become agents of change in today?s world.
    \n\nResearch efforts will focus on fabrication and characterization of nanohybrids
    combining CdX (X=S, Se) thin films with conducting polymers and wide-bandgap semiconducting
    metal oxides for photovoltaic and photocatalytic applications. Detailed studies
    of the nanohybrids formation process and their characterization will help to identify
    the key parameters influencing the semiconductor heterojunction quality, such
    as: materials? choice, their synthesis and processing, in order to correlate their
    composition, structure and performance. The experiments proposed in this project
    will test this hypothesis. Both, material synthesis and characterization of the
    photoelectrochemical and photocatalytic properties will be performed using state-of-the-art
    electrochemical, spectroscopic and microscopic instrumentation available at Warsaw
    University laboratories. The US-Polish team expects to gain a better understanding
    of the basic working principles of these nanohybrid materials in order to increase
    their effectiveness and construct high efficiency solar cells and photocatalytic
    devices for environmental remediation. Successful completion of the proposed research
    would suggest solutions on some environmental issues, such as: hazardous waste
    treatment and low cost, high efficiency, alternative energy sources. The results

    and biodiversity conservation on tropical forests and primates\n\nMichael D. Wasserman
    & Peter A. Beck, Environmental Science & Policy, St. Edward's University\n\n\nNon-technical
    Project Description\n\nBiodiversity loss, climate change, and pollution are major
    threats to ecosystem functioning and quality of human life, especially for societies
    that directly depend upon the local environment for resources.  Addressing human-environment
    interactions is particularly important for tropical forest ecosystems. These ecosystems
    contain approximately half of all living species, play an important role in climate
    change mitigation through carbon storage, and filter pollutants from water and
    air.  However, traditional conservation strategies that exclude local populations
    have often been ineffective leading to significant forest loss over the past several
    decades.  This NSF IRES research program will evaluate the effectiveness of alternative
    conservation strategies to maintain tropical forest ecosystems and primate populations,
    while also maintaining the livelihoods of local communities surrounding the forests.
    \ Through this research program, underrepresented students in the environmental
    sciences will gain international field research experience.  The investigators
    will integrate ecological and social research methods to address questions critical
    to fields of ecology, anthropology, and environmental policy, address current
    environmental issues such as habitat fragmentation and biodiversity loss, and
    provide STEM training for underrepresented students at two biological field stations
    in Costa Rica (La Selva and Las Cruces) in collaboration with the Organization
    for Tropical Studies.  Students will work closely with Costa Rican field assistants
    and local communities during their research, thus providing multiple opportunities
    for cultural exchange.  Interested Costa Rican university students will be included
    in the projects and encouraged to apply for the master's program in environmental
    management and sustainability at St. Edward's University.  At the end of the 10-week
    program, students will present their initial results to local communities and
    Costa Rican scholars at a public forum and will be encouraged to communicate their
    final results through peer-reviewed publication and presentations at professional
    conferences.  An additional end product associated with this program and utilized
    by the IRES students will be a fully functioning laboratory capable of running
    immunoassays for quantifying primate hormone levels in the field, thus transferring
    scientific knowledge and infrastructure to a developing country.  Results from
    this research program will provide important insight useful to the design of policies
    for sustaining both biodiversity and human livelihoods, particularly in tropical
    forest regions.  \n\nTechnical Project Description\n\nTropical forests are one
    of the world's most important ecosystems, containing at least half of all species,
    regulating climate, purifying air and water, and providing resources for local
    communities.  Nonetheless, over the past few decades widespread deforestation
    has significantly reduced the extent of tropical forests, leading to declines
    in wildlife populations that depend on them through habitat loss and fragmentation.
    \ Primate populations have been especially affected with more than 60% of all
    species considered vulnerable or endangered by the IUCN.  Efforts to preserve
    the remaining forests and threatened species dependent on them have largely focused
    on creating protected areas, such as national parks.  However, citizens often
    rely heavily on natural resources for subsistence and environmental laws are regularly
    breached in developing countries, thus weakening the effectiveness of protected
    areas.  As a result, conservation policies have evolved from exclusionary protected
    areas to strategies that focus on local communities by providing economic and
    other incentives.  Despite the increasing promotion of community-based alternatives
    by both scholars and practitioners, little evidence exists that they are any more
    effective than protected areas at maintaining forest quality or sustaining primate
    populations.  Therefore, this NSF IRES research program has two main objectives:
    1. To quantify how policies integrating conservation and development objectives,
    such as ecotourism, academic research activities, and multiple-use protected areas,
    influence tropical forests and their primates, as well as how effective these
    environmental policies are at maintaining human livelihoods.  2. To provide international
    field research experience to underrepresented students in the environmental sciences.
    \ To meet these objectives, student projects will examine differences in forest
    condition (e.g., fragment size, % canopy cover, carbon storage, diversity) and
    primate biology (i.e., physiology, behavior, population size) across a number
    of forests at and surrounding Las Cruces and La Selva Biological Stations in Costa
    Rica that are protected for various objectives (i.e., ecotourism, research, national
    conservation).  Students will also examine the effects of these strategies on
    local community livelihoods and how this influences local perception of environmental
    policy.  Specifically, 15 ten-week independent master's student research projects
    will occur across a three-year period to survey primate populations, quantify
    behavior, measure primate fecal hormone levels with immunoassays in country (an
    environmental endocrinology laboratory will be established in Costa Rica), conduct
    interviews and surveys of local landowners, other stakeholders, and tourists,
    and quantify forest characteristics.  By examining interactions between people,
    parks, and primates through independent, yet interrelated, student projects, we
    will be able to provide a thorough analysis of the effectiveness of private ecotourism,
    public protected areas, and academic research stations to maintain livelihoods
    for human populations and promote conservation of biodiversity.  Results from
    this project will add significantly to the knowledge of how economic, participatory,
    and research incentives can affect conservation decisions and outcomes.  As a
    breakdown in either natural ecosystems or human society will negatively affect
    the other, quantifying the effectiveness of various environmental management strategies
    to maintain both biodiversity and local community livelihoods is necessary to
    ensure that these policies are actually promoting sustainability and conservation."

    IRES Water Quality and Household Energy in Post-Earthquake Nepal: Long Term Protection of Community Health

    Non-technical description

    This IRES award brings together a diverse community of researchers and students from the United States and Nepal. In addition to working directly with local and international scientists, U.S. students will communicate to other undergraduate and graduate students through blogging about international research experience. Participants will also develop education materials, with help from local collaborators, to help inform community members in host countries. Upon return to their home institution, students will present their results through professional seminars and scientific publications. The students trained by this proposed program will be the future leaders of an elite international development workforce diminishing the impact of infectious disease on human health by nurturing the interaction of persons of different disciplines and skill sets to meet water, sanitation, and household energy needs worldwide.

    Technical description

    This U.S. - Nepal international research experience for students (IRES) project supports partnership between researchers from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), the Environment and Public Health Organization, Nepal (ENPHO), the Center for Rural Technology Nepal (CRT-N), the Institute of Engineering, Nepal (IOE) and the Nepal Department of Health Services. Over a three-year period, this program will engage three U.S. undergraduate and three U.S. graduate students annually, for a total of eighteen participants, at multiple research sites in Nepal to study the aftermath of natural disaster like earthquake on microbial water quality compounded with sanitation practices. Following training and research preparation at UIUC, students will travel to Nepal, where they will be co-mentored by professors and researchers from the partner institutes. Each student's research training will include experience with planning and implementation of field strategies for drinking water sampling in the affected areas; interviewing local people to understand the sanitation practices and the sustainability of relief efforts; and data collection on waterborne illnesses. Following each portion of fieldwork and sample processing in Kathmandu, participants return to UIUC to prepare collected samples for metagenomics, 16S and 18S sequencing, qPCR and bioinformatics analysis. These will be studied to identify opportunistic pathogens in collected water sample, and patterns of presence with different sanitation practices. Results will provide new insights on the risks of outbreak of diarrheal diseases after extreme natural events in developing world, and how human practices may increase or decrease these risks.

    \n\nThis program will partner students from Central Washington University (CWU)
    with top scientists from Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM) to explore
    tropical dry forest ecology in a world-class biological field station in western
    Mexico. Each year, for three years, cohorts of 5 students will spend 8 weeks at
    Estación de Biología, Chamela (EBCh) working alongside UNAM and CWU mentors on
    three general avenues of investigation: 1) interactions in the parasite-host system
    centered on the agents of Chagas disease (kissing bugs), 2) ecological responses
    of vertebrates to intense seasonality, and 3) current and future effects of a
    major coastal highway on ecological connectivity of vertebrates. The world-class
    facilities and pristine forests of EBCh attract leading scientists from México
    and throughout the world to conduct cutting-edge research. This setting will provide
    an exceptional opportunity for students to develop academic relationships with
    Mexican scientists and their students, laying the foundation for future collaborations.
    This program will help build the next generation of internationally-literate scientists
    by guiding bilingual Hispanic-American students to conduct science, facilitating
    language and cultural literacy with their non-Spanish speaking peers, and developing
    the skills, connections, and confidence to pursue careers in the sciences. The
    program will also create opportunities for CWU faculty to develop collaborations
    with Mexican scientists and encourage Mexican scholars to visit CWU where they
    can share their insights, discoveries, and culture with our broader community.
    \n\nThe Chamela/Cuitzmala biosphere reserve in western Mexico is surrounded by
    some of the best examples of seasonally dry tropical forest (SDTF) remaining in
    the world. SDTF comprise almost half of the world's tropical forests, representing
    a larger fraction than rain forests. They provide a set of ecosystem services
    that rival wet forests, and they harbor a remarkable concentration of endemic
    species, many of which are threatened or endangered. Despite their importance,
    SDTFs are among the least studied and most threatened of the world's forested
    ecosystems and, as a result, are at greater risk than are wet forests. Students
    will work UNAM's Institute of Biology to investigate the relationships among blood-feeding
    triatomine insects, the parasite they carry, Trypanosoma cruzi, and the mammals
    the insects feed on. This work will aid in our understanding of which mammals
    in SDTF serve as reservoirs of Chagas disease. Other students will track reptiles
    and amphibians in the forest during the extreme transition from dry season to
    wet season in July. This research will contribute new insights into how vertebrate
    ectotherms manage strong seasonality, a defining feature of SDTF. Some students
    may investigate parrot ecology in SDTF, exploring variation in food and nesting
    resources for parrots and other cavity-nesting birds. Others will use remote cameras
    and transect surveys to monitor wildlife activity in the forest and along Mexican
    highway 200, which bisects the biosphere reserve. Results from this project will
    be used to guide decisions on how best to minimize habitat fragmentation associated
    with planned expansion of that highway. Students will be members of a cohesive
    team working together on ongoing research by our Mexican mentors to address relevant
    and important issues in the structure, functioning and conservation of SDTF."

Nanofibers have diameters from one to four orders of magnitude smaller than the diameters of conventional microfibers produced by mechanical drawing.  As a result of their small size, nanofibers can demonstrate superior properties that provide critical advantages in many applications.  Nanofibers (NF) are increasingly explored in high performance filtration, batteries and fuel cells, wound healing, composite material reinforcements, blood vessel and tissue engineering, smart textiles, drug delivery, gas sensors, electronics, and catalysis. The global market for NF is expected to grow at an annual growth rate of 35% between 2014 and 2020 and reach ~$1 billion by 2017.  There are huge needs in the development of sizeable and ?green? production of NF from a larger range of materials, providing easier ways for NF processing into functional structures, and developing a skilled workforce.  This IRES will provide at least 18 undergraduate and graduate students from the University of Alabama at Birmingham with unique hands-on experience and significant knowledge of cutting-edge NF fabrication methods, as well as NF testing and application by providing an intense research program at the Technical University of Liberec (TUL), Czech Republic, a leading academic center in nanofiber research and commercialization, and at the Lodz University of Technology (UT-Lodz), a regional leader in catalysis and bio-fuels in Poland. Students will develop practical skills needed to address the knowledge gaps in NF science and technology, bring their experiences back to their home institutions, and help to develop a global-capable workforce for this emerging market. By using a cohesive approach and drawing on complementary expertise, facilities and traditions across the nations and regions, will enhance the intellectual as well as the societal and economic returns of this IRES program.

    This program will provide 18 students from the University of Alabama at Birmingham with a unique opportunity to carry out 8 week of cutting-edge research at the forefront of nanofiber science, technology, and biomedical and energy applications at the Technical University of Liberec (TUL), Czech Republic, a leading academic center in nanofiber research and commercialization, and at the Lodz University of Technology (UT-Lodz), a regional leader in heterogeneous catalysis, Poland.  Nanofibers (NF) form a large class of materials that can exhibit nano-enabled unique properties, which are unattainable at a larger scale.  However, the growth potential of the NF materials market is still hindered by the limited ability to efficiently generate sizeable quantities of nanofibers with predictable and controllable complex, macroscopic architectures and desirable properties.  Students will work at TUL with a new, high-rate, alternating-current electrospinning (ac-electrospinning) process that unveils several new physical phenomena which help to overcome major disadvantages of commonly used dc-electrospinning, such as ?whipping? instability and residual electric charge, while increasing the process productivity by 1 ? 2 orders of magnitude. Students will explore selected NF-based materials for advanced catalytic systems with improved activity, selectivity and stability in many reactions at UT-Lodz, along with other applications tested at TUL.  During the pre-trip training, foreign site work, and post-trip activities, students will focus on advancing basic understanding of all aspects of emerging high-rate ac-electrospinning, in order to direct the assembly of NF into desired configurations and to stimulate the development of commercializable processes for nanofiber-based materials for heterogeneous catalysis, biomedical uses, and other potential applications.  Overall, this program shall facilitate a broader long-term collaboration between the US and international research groups within the nanofiber research and manufacturing domain by bringing new collaborators and facilitating multiple international links between the researchers and students in related areas.

- abstractText: "IRES: US-Denmark Collaboration to Create Next Generation Biosensors\n\nThere
    is a great need for the development of fast and simple detection devices for diseases
    ranging from cancer to malaria. Not only will this assist in diagnosing diseases,
    it will also help to monitor treatments and allow for a quick change in treatment
    options if required. A better way to tackle these challenges is to work with an
    interdisciplinary team of scientists and engineers. The team will likely develop
    better solutions if they are not only diverse in training, but also diverse in
    culture. For this reason, we will take a diverse group of students, ranging from
    Michigan Tech graduate students, undergraduates from Michigan Tech and other universities,
    and community college students, and have them work for the summer in Denmark.
    \ Aarhus University is a world-class research institution working on health diagnostics
    for the future. The science and engineering students will be joined in this experience
    by a communications student. This student will assist the technical students in
    the creation of videos that describes their experience in the lab and the projects
    they contributed to. This is a shift is how scientific education is often taught.
    This project will break the cycle of engineers and scientists only speaking to
    one another and help open the lines of communication to show the public what is
    happening behind the laboratory doors. The technical students will greatly benefit
    from the exposure to technical communication while the communication student will
    learn more about working with technical researchers. The end product will be 18
    highly trained students who will have increased opportunity to explore technical
    careers while producing videos that explain to the public the importance of the
    research they conducted. The technical students will also create and present posters
    at a local technical conference that highlight the research conducted. \n\nToday?s
    global health challenges require interdisciplinary knowledge, international research
    collaboration, and intercultural communication competencies.  This project will
    provide international research experiences for an interdisciplinary cohort of
    students focused on early detection of malaria and cancer though an established
    collaboration with Michigan Tech and Aarhus University in Denmark.  The goal is
    to create scientists and engineers who can creatively and collaboratively solve
    future problems in health diagnostics and beyond, and we strive to increase the
    students? perspective through this international experience.  Our team consists
    of a biologist, pathologist, mechanical engineer and chemical engineers.  This
    project will explore new disease biomarkers, determine the clinical relevance
    of the biomarkers and design new microdevices that will improve clinical adoption
    of the new technology.  Over a three-year period, the proposed summer international
    research experiences will prepare, annually, a cohort of five diverse science
    and engineering students to engage in an eight-week global biosensor research
    experience and one technical communications student to document and disseminate
    the research efforts.  A unique aspect of this project is the inclusion of a technical
    communications student.  This will provide student researchers with an education
    in scientific communication, which is often lacking in current scientific education,
    but is extremely important for the future of scientific funding and public rapport
    in the U.S.  The incorporation of a technical communications student will synergistically
    teach the scientific students the difficulties and importance of scientific communication
    to the public.  It is expected that all the participants will return as more engaged
    students with an increased propensity for new ideas and collaboration.  In addition,
    the students will engage other students through poster sessions of their experience
    and professionally produced online videos that will provide the motivation for
    others to seek out international research opportunities."

    The LPIA is regarded as the best pre-Quaternary analogue for contemporary global
    change. Despite the significance of this time interval in the climate history
    of Earth, our understanding of the response of marine and terrestrial ecosystems
    to late Paleozoic climate and environmental change remains poorly understood.
    Our multidisciplinary research will include paleoecological, geochemical, and
    stratigraphic analyses on extensively preserved floral and faunal fossils in southern
    and western Argentina. To recruit a broader cross section of the diverse SE Wisconsin
    area to the Geosciences, our rigorous recruitment and training strategy involves
    new outreach programs created by the PIs and leveraging existing multi-institutional
    collaborations. Different cohorts of undergraduate and graduate students will
    travel with the PIs to Argentina for up to 4 weeks each year to conduct research
    on paleoclimatic and paleoecologic change during the LPIA. Respected Argentinian

    Part 1
    This proposal plans to carry out low-frequency radio measurements of cosmic magnetism through a collaboration between Arizona State University and the German Long Wavelength Consortium. Each year, the program will fund two first-year graduate students and five advanced undergraduates, who will carry out research with the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR), a remarkable new European radio telescope. Due to its sensitivity, resolution, and frequency coverage, LOFAR will allow for intergalactic magnetic field measurements orders of magnitude better than previously possible.

    Part 2
    Magnetic fields thread the Universe, setting the criteria for star formation in galaxies, controlling the evolution of galaxy clusters, and altering the intergalactic medium from which all galaxies formed. Yet very little is known about their properties.
    LOFAR is the first of a new generation of telescopes that operates in the extremely low frequency range between 10 and 240 MHz. Magnetic fields are primarily detected by their interactions with cosmic rays, and only telescopes at these low frequencies, which
    correspond to low cosmic ray energies, are able to make sensitive measurements far away from cosmic ray sources and out in the depths of intergalactic space. With this remarkable new tool, the projects carried out by IRES students will help to open a new window on the magnetic universe. On galaxy scales, they will probe the connection between star formation and magnetism and the origin of the magnetic fields that surround galaxies. On galaxy cluster scales, they will probe the unknown physics of the hot
    intracluster medium and the evolution of the synchrotron emitting bubbles found within it. On cosmic scales they will uncover the magnetic properties of the web of gas that connects all galaxies. Together they will be filling in a key piece of the fundamental question: what is the structure of the Universe on the largest scales?

    This International Research Experience for Students (IRES) program focuses on engineering and technology projects related to mitigating global climate change, and is a collaboration between the University of North Dakota (UND), California State Polytechnic University at Pomona (CPP), and the Energy Research Institute (ERI) at the University of Leeds, UK. The student research projects will include: novel methods to extract, recover, and process the constituents of algae and biomass-derived oils for use as renewable fuels, replacements for fossil-derived commodity chemicals, and other high value specialty chemicals; fundamental studies of solar energy absorption by nanoparticles to improve solar energy systems; integrating biomass pyrolysis/electrical generation systems; identifying ways to remove barriers for a more sustainable civilian aviation  industry; and studying ways to accelerate the adoption of district energy technologies for the supply of heating and cooling in both the US and Europe.  The research will leverage an ongoing partnership between UND and CPP by adding collaborators at a leading UK research institute.

    Through this award, undergraduate and graduate student investigators will work on key components of ongoing research efforts aimed at developing technologies that help to mitigate the overall emission of fossil-derived carbon, primarily from the supply and use of energy resources, upon the atmosphere.  An annual cohort of five students will participate in a year-long program, and a nine week research experience at Leeds will form the core of the program. The topic theme is designed to provide a wide spectrum of interdisciplinary projects that will enrich the student experience.  Participants will be drawn from UND (a research university) and CPP (a nondoctoral Hispanic serving university) that have a strong partnership with multiple pathways to encourage CPP students to consider research as a future career path.

    The scientific communities of the U.S. and China suffer from a lack of direct contact between their junior members of the two countries, especially students. The proposed International Research Experiences for Students (IRES) program will support 24 U.S. undergraduate students to conduct research in applied mathematics at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) during the summer of 2016, 2017, and 2018. The IRES students will be assigned to teams, each consisting of two US and two Hong Kong students, and each team will work on a research project sponsored by a Chinese company or government agency. The US students will live and work at HKUST with students from Hong Kong. The project will be supervised overall by the PI, with local supervision by HKUST Mathematics Professor and Department Chair Yang Wang and Professor Shingyu Leung. The nine-week-long collaborative project is designed to expose U.S. students to the international mathematics research community at an early stage of their careers. The IRES project will increase the visibility of U.S. students in Hong Kong and China through their activities in the HKUST campus and through their direct collaboration with Hong Kong students. The US student participants will be about 50% women and 20% from an underrepresented minority group demonstrating NSF?s commitment to participation in STEM fields by under-represented minority groups.

    The IRES project will provide U.S. students with valuable experience in mathematics research, industrial research, international collaboration, and team work at a highly-regarded research institute. The research projects and sponsors will change every year, which is by design to keep the projects at the leading edge of scientific research. All projects involve mathematics on important current problems.  Recent examples (and industrial sponsors) include Doubly Ensemble Movie Prediction with Social Media Data Using TBEEF (Baidu), Detection of Somatic Mutations in Sequenced Pair Samples (BGI), Probabilistic Radar-Based Nowcasting of Monsoonal Rainstorms in Hong Kong (Hong Kong Observatory), Improved Maximum Likelihood Detection in MIMO Systems (Huawei), and Intelligent Eye for the Visually Impaired (Lenovo). We expect each project to result in publications and lead to further research collaboration.  The knowledge and skills that students learn from this project will better prepare them for their professional careers.

The IRES students will attend a two-week intensive Chinese language and cultural course at the main campus of CUG and then conduct a five-week field investigation in the Three Gorges Reservoir area. The field investigations will be supervised by the PI and three professors at CUG, Drs. Huiming Tang, Hanwen Zhou, and Changqian Ma from the China University of Geosciences (CUG) in Wuhan.  The eight-week-long collaborative project is designed to expose U.S. students to the international landslide research community at an early stage of their careers. The IRES project will increase the visibility of U.S. students in China through their activities in the CUG campus and in the Three Gorges Reservoir area.

    The IRES project will provide U.S. students with hands-on field research experience in landslide surveying, mapping, monitoring, and early-warning. The main research objectives are to (1) develop a GPS based real-time landslide monitoring and early-warning system at the Huangtupo landslide site, (2) develop a rapid landslide mapping method using high-accuracy GPS and LiDAR integrated technologies, and (3) study the correlation of landslide movements with fluctuation of the water level within the Three Gorges Reservoir. The methods developed through this project can be modified to serve other regions prone to landslides. The knowledge and skills that students learn from this project will better prepare them for their professional careers.

    Catlos, co-PI: Elliott, Kyle\n\nPART 1:\nThis International Research Experiences
    for Students (IRES) program provides four weeks of geological field-based research
    and training experiences across Turkey for 12 US students. Over the next 3 years,
    these students will investigate suture zones,i.e.locations where ancient ocean
    basins closed across the country. Turkey contains a large number of these zones,
    which are key locations used by geologists to understand how continents grow.
    Continental growth is considered one of the most important problems facing Earth
    Scientists, yet models for the process are debated, due in part to a lack of geologic
    record. Because of its extensive outcrops of ancient rocks associated with suture
    zones, Turkey is an ideal location to study this process.\n\nThe IRES program
    has societal value, as Turkey's suture zones can be associated with important
    ore and mineral resources or are regions of major, present-day geologic hazards.
    Older faults that worked to close the ocean basins today form regions of active
    earthquake activity or have generated topography that leads to large landslides.
    Understanding the locations and ages of Turkey's ancient suture zones has an impact
    on diverse topics, including mineral exploration and hazard reduction. This proposal
    includes partnerships with faculty at three Turkish universities (Dokuz Eylul
    University, Middle East Technical University, and Karadeniz Technical University)
    who will serve as mentors. Students chosen to participate are underrepresented
    in the geosciences and are selected via Jackson School and UT Austin outreach
    programs. Students will partner with Turkish researchers to explore a range of
    geological concepts discussed in their courses while making a significant impact
    on our understanding of processes related to the formation of continental crust.
    Students will apply innovative methods to address scientific questions involving
    both the timing and impacts of Turkey's suture zones, including electronic-based
    field mapping techniques and new geochemical approaches. This in turn will lead
    to insight into how the past geological history of Turkey impacts its present
    day concerns, including the development of economically important resources and
    hazard mitigation.  \n\n\nPART 2:\nUnderstanding how continents grow is recognized
    as one of the most important geodynamic problems facing Earth Scientists. Models
    for the process are debated, due in part to a lack of exposure of the geologic

    fragments, Turkey is an ideal location to study this process. This International
    Research Experiences for Students (IRES) program provides four weeks of geological
    field-based research and training experiences across Turkey for 12 US students.
    Over the next 3 years, these students will investigate the arc accretion processes
    that occurred in Turkey during the closure of branches of ancient ocean basins.\n\nIn
    addition, the IRES program has societal value, as paleogeographic reconstructions
    are used to identify important economic resources that formed during specific
    times in Earth's history and assess geologic hazards that result due to reactivation
    of older faults or mass movement of rocks. This proposal includes partnerships
    with faculty at 3 Turkish universities (Dokuz Eylul University, Middle East Technical
    University, and Karadeniz Technical University) who will serve as mentors. Students
    chosen to participate are underrepresented in the geosciences and are selected

    This U.S.-Czech international research experience for students (IRES) project supports a partnership between scientists from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL) and the Czech Technical University-Prague (CTU) that is designed to prepare U.S. students for STEM graduate-level study through an early career cooperative research experience focused on the earth's vadose zone, known as the geologic "skin of the earth." For each of the three years of this IRES project, cohorts of four U.S. science and engineering students will expand their global competence through a well-integrated, eight-week international research and educational experience in the Czech Republic. Principal Investigator Chittaranjan Ray (UNL), along with lead counterparts Michal Snìhota and Martin Sanda (CTU), will serve as mentors.  In their collaboration with CTU scientists and students, U.S. participants will jointly conduct hypothesis-driven laboratory experiments and field investigations designed to characterize water and chemical movement in unsaturated soils with macro pores (large pores due to wormholes, cracks etc.) at site-to-watershed scale in the Czech Republic.  The U.S. students will learn about creative, original, and potentially transformative methods the Czechs are using to study the fate and transport of water and contaminants through the unsaturated zone, particularly in terms of preferential flow.  New research results and knowledge of novel technologies being used in Europe will be shared in the U.S. through this project, thereby contributing to the development of a more globally engaged science workforce as well as to the sustainability of valuable water resources which affect economic competitiveness both domestically and internationally.

    U.S. IRES participants will collaborate with the Czech researchers to evaluate the utility and accuracy of these new methods, which promise to significantly expand scientific understanding of vadose zone processes. These are considered critical to protecting and preserving ground water resources. As the "skin" of the earth, the vadose zone, or the unsaturated zone, regulates various functions like water percolation and contaminant attenuation, among others. Over the course of their IRES research abroad, U.S. students will learn about and use new technologies and methods developed in Europe.  Understanding flow and transport processes in the vadose zone is a key to identifying ground water pollution potential and to developing mitigation strategies.  IRES participants also will work with Czech partners to evaluate the utility and accuracy of innovative Czech technologies used to study water flow at different scales. Their findings are expected to materially contribute data about the correlation of small-scale measurements of soil properties to watershed processes.  Overall, the IRES experience is intended to encourage a diverse group of undergraduate participants to pursue graduate education in STEM fields.  The U.S. students will be encouraged to publish and to share their experiences via the UNL-maintained IRES website and through presentations at appropriate professional meetings, such as meetings of the American Society of Engineering Education.

    science. This IRES project is designed to help meet these challenges by providing
    students and young researchers with opportunities for international training early
    in their educational and professional trajectories. This three-year project will
    support a total of 21 undergraduate and graduate students from three US institutions
    for research training and cultural experiences in Australia. The students will
    work with the U.S. PIs and Australian researchers on how dynamic environmental
    factors influence the social structure, behavior, and fitness of small songbirds

    provide technical training in modern integrative behavioral ecology methods, and
    will build the capacity of IRES students to work with foreign collaborators in
    the future. IRES students will also use a range of dissemination modalities, including
    professional presentations at conferences, peer-reviewed journal publications,
    video, and internet productions, to increase interest in international research
    among US university students, K-12 students, and the general public. Participants
    will receive intensive mentoring before, during, and after their international
    experience from both U.S. and Australian senior researchers. The project will
    broaden access to international STEM research by actively recruiting and retaining
    students from under-represented groups. In doing so, it will fulfill the IRES

    This program will send 5 CSU students per year to work on ATLAS research projects
    for ATLAS Run-2 and ATLAS detector upgrades. The physics potential of incoming
    Run-2 will be 10 to 100 times greater than Run-1 during which the Higgs boson
    was discovered. The CSU students will improve the NLO Monte Carlo generators (NLOjet++,

    with ATLAS data, extract the Parton Distribution Function (PDF), and understand
    systematic uncertainties in Top quark reconstruction. The measurements of spin
    and polarization properties of the Top quark are important tests of the Standard
    Model and are sensitive to new physics beyond the Standard Model. On ATLAS detector
    upgrades R&D, the CSU students will work on the installation and data analysis
    of small stand-along pixel detectors, and improving software packages in monitoring
    various inner detector components. On ATLAS Trigger and Data Acquisition (DAQ),
    the CSU students will develop associative memory variables for Fast Tracker (FTK),

    Non-Technical Abstract: As future bioengineers, the participating students will appreciate the impact of international differences in regulation, culture and ethics, and engineering approaches. The purpose of the program is to teach, train, and mentor under-represented undergraduates (minorities and women-U.S. citizens or permanent residents) each year via cross-cultural immersion at Nanyang Technological University (NTU)in Singapore. The project themes entail research related to transformative biomedical applications. This IRES project will enhance 1) student learning abilities; 2) intercultural competencies; and 3) retention and enrollment in graduate studies. The program will provide international educational opportunities to enable participants to effectively compete as global leaders in this field.

    Technical Abstract: Efforts to engage U.S. students in biomedical research abroad, particularly those from under-represented groups are essential for training the next generation of STEM professionals who can work in a global environment. In this three year program, under-represented students will be participating in a biomedical-focused international research experience (IRES) at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in Singapore. The participants, all from the EPSCoR state of South Carolina, include Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). Program objectives will be assessed by measuring how well the IRES program trains participants in 1) research skills (e.g. learning to conduct research, data analysis, formulating research hypotheses); 2) intercultural competencies; and 3) retention and enrollment in graduate studies.
    The IRES research project is in biomedical sciences with specific importance in developing new technologies. During this three year project (2015-17), qualified undergraduates from different institutions will spend eight summer weeks at NTU in Singapore performing research with dedicated mentors.The intellectual merit of the program involves: 1) Creating specific biomedical science projects; 2) Creating well-developed research and outreach activities; and 3) Developing a specific and appropriate plan to measure the PI's goals to train all GMG fellows in the skills of STEM research and learning while living abroad. Broader impacts involve: 1) Providing summer research experiences for under-represented undergraduates designed to encourage pursuit of graduate study; 2) Providing US students from an EPSCoR state the opportunity to conduct research in a Southeast Asian research laboratory and learn intercultural competencies; 3) Leveraging the previous experience and skills of students trained in other programs; 4) Providing designed professional and cultural development activities for the students; 5) Training participants to disseminate their research to biomedical science peers; and 6) Enhancing existing collaborations between Clemson and NTU.

    Over a three-year period, this International Research Experience for Students (IRES) program will engage  two U.S. undergraduate and two U.S. graduate students annually, for a total of twelve participants, at research sites in Greenland and Denmark to study Arctic microbiology and biogeochemistry under multiple climate change scenarios.  Following required training and research preparation at the University of Montana, students travel to Copenhagen for orientation and introduction to international mentors before they depart for three weeks of field work in Greenland.   Throughout, students are co-mentored by William Holben, the U.S. principal investigator (PI), and a team of experts associated with the Greenlandic Center for Permafrost Studies (CENPERM), a center that is administered by the University of Copenhagen and the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland.   Each student's research training will include experience with planning and implementing field strategies for permafrost, ice sheet, and hot spring and glacier sampling in a way that promotes student ownership of individual projects, while facilitating the integration of multiple data sets obtained throughout the duration of this IRES activity.  Results are expected to contribute to what is known about thawing permafrost and accelerated microbial decomposition of large amounts of organic matter stored in Arctic ecosystems.

    Following each season of fieldwork and sample processing in Greenland, participants return to Copenhagen to prepare collected samples for metagenomic DNA and mRNA sequencing and bioinformatic analysis. These will be studied for patterns of microbial community change that reflect differing and changing environmental parameters.  Upon returning to Montana students will continue the computational and bioinformatic aspects of their studies.  Results should provide new insights into microbial community structure and activities on sheet ice and glaciers, as well as microbial biogeochemical cycling contributions to greenhouse gas emissions from permafrost soils. Over the course of this IRES program, the U.S. and CENPERM partners expect to deepen their collaboration through international teamwork, research training, and cultural interaction, as they mentor and engage a cadre of diverse students, including Native Americans, to become the next generation of climate change experts.  For broader impact, all participating U.S. students will benefit from early career experience with the kind of long-term relationship, professional network and research collaboration that is increasingly necessary to address complex global ecological issues.

    improvement of quality of life for disbaled, and health and caretaking for children
    and elderly.\nThis project will place students from the University of Central
    Florida under the mentorship of the PI (Dr. A. J. Gonzalez) and of Dr. Klaus Jantke,
    the counterpart at FIDMT in Ilmenau, Germany. Dr. Jantke is the director of the
    Children's Media Department of FIDMT located in Erfurt, Germany and has a long
    and illustrious history in research in computing media. The international aspect
    of innovative and advanced research is essential in modern research hence the
    PIs will work with three cohorts of students, one during each year of the project's
    existence. Each cohort will include one graduate student and either two undergraduates
    (the first year) or four (in each of the subsequent years).  The research period
    for each cohort will be 16 weeks - eight weeks in the US and eight weeks in Germany
    for each year of the grant period.\nThis research project is motivated by an ancient
    art of storytelling. In our pursuit of an artificially intelligent computer agent,
    the IRES project seeks to build a capability to autonomously synthesize possible
    scenarios for the system development and to modify them dynamically upon listener
    request. More specifically, the topic of the research in this project is the creation
    of an avatar-based system that can synthesize and adapt a scenario according to
    the user's request in real time and without any pre-scripted pathways. Good storytellers
    were treasured in medieval times, given the lack of other media through which
    to relate a story to a mostly illiterate population. Therefore, the project seeks
    to embody the storyteller in a lifelike avatar that resembles an actual person.
    This avatar will tell the story to the listener in spoken natural language, and
    interact with her/him when the latter requests changes to the story. \n\nPart
    2\nStorytelling media have evolved over time, from oral stories to modern E-books.
    Since the development of the computer, storytelling systems have become a science
    of their own, and have evolved from simple systems that can only generate a single
    short story to systems that respond to the listener's actions by modifying the
    story dynamically in real time. Digital storytelling has therefore become a growing
    field within artificial intelligence. The project seeks to take this evolution
    of storytelling media one step further by doing research to create a virtual storyteller
    who tells a dynamic story. The story is modifiable through a request by the listener
    (typically a child, a student, or an elderly person), yet will seek to remain
    realistic as well as interesting. Every story has a story space. That is, only
    so many things can happen in a story. We use contextual reasoning to represent
    the story space. In the real world, courses of action are influenced by the current
    context, making some conversational avatars very attractive while others unattractive
    when addressing the current situation within the story space. In a similar manner,
    the situation faced by the protagonist in the dynamic scenario will limit the
    choices of actions that he/she would otherwise have, thereby taking the story
    in various directions, none of which need be specifically pre-scripted.  The PIs
    base the proposed research on the use of formal methods to manipulate the story
    space within the main theme of the story. By formal methods the PIs mean that
    one represents the story knowledge formally in terms of strings, interaction sequences
    such as storyboards and graphs, formulas (for conditions), and the like. Formal
    methods, therefore, will give the ability to reason with formal methods (string
    comparison, unification, anti-unification and the like) in the story space. Formal
    methods have been used in the literature to manipulate contextual information."

    The University of Michigan and South African National Space Agency (SANSA) Space Weather International Research Experience for Students (IRES) program (UM-SANSA-IRES or MSI for short) will support 18 students (six per year) spending the northern hemisphere summer (8-weeks) at the SANSA Space Science Directorate located in Hermanus, South Africa working on a variety of space weather science and engineering projects. Space Weather is the field of space science that seeks to understand the impact of solar disturbances on the Earth's space environment especially with respect to technology.  The goals of MSI include (1) engage undergraduates in publishable research projects; (2) development of students' scientific communication skills; (3) development of culturally competent and societally aware scientists and engineers and (4) strengthening existing and developing new UM and SANSA collaborations and exchanges.

    The students will be paired with SANSA scientists, engineers and post-docs to provide one-on-one research mentoring, will participate in the annual "Space Weather Winter School" held by SANSA in June and July and attend the South African Institute of Physics (SAIP) Conference. Pre and post trip activities at the University of Michigan will provide scientific, cultural and professional development programs to enhance the impact of the international research experience. The students will also have a UM scientific mentor to engage the students prior and after the IRES experience, which will also foster scientific collaborations between UM and SANSA scientists and engineers.

    Space weather is an important area of research, especially because of the implications for communications and other crucial technologies including satellite navigation and communication systems, power grids, and ground-and-aircraft-based HF radio communication. There are significant variations in space weather effects depending on latitude, local time, and longitude, as well as northern and southern hemispheric differences depending on season. The research focus of this IRES program is to understand space weather effects at mid- and low-latitudes, differences between the northern and summer hemisphere, and between the American and African sectors. The program takes advantage of the impressive facilities and expertise available at SANSA. SANSA Space Science is currently responsible for monitoring the space environment over the Southern African region, Indian and Atlantic oceans as well as the South Pole, and forms part of a global network of similar organizations throughout the world. Instruments are deployed throughout South Africa, Namibia, Antarctica, Marion Island and Gough Island. SANSA is host to the only Space Weather Regional Warning Center in Africa and therefore develops and operates space weather forecasting models for a broad region. IRES MSI students will participate in SANSA research which includes studies on the variation of the Earth's geomagnetic field and its application to navigation, the propagation of waves in the various regions of the space environment and their effects, diagnostic information on the propagation media, ionospheric characterization, basic and applied space weather, space plasmas, and radio wave propagation.

    Scientific research in cultural heritage is a powerful vehicle for interdisciplinary, integrated and global science training in STEM graduate and undergraduate education and consistently exceeds STEM benchmarks of gender inclusion. This U.S.-Netherlands International Research Experience for Students (IRES) project supports three student cohorts, each consisting of one undergraduate and four graduate students, for research visits to the Netherlands to study the materials, structures and aging of cultural heritage artifacts.  The program approaches the analysis of art as a way to provide unique research and educational experiences for U.S. student participants in chemistry, materials science, electrical engineering, and computer science.  Led by Principal Investigator, Marc Walton, the cooperative activities with Dutch counterparts are designed to provide access to advanced infrastructure for interdisciplinary cultural heritage science while fostering long-term partnerships between recognized centers of excellence in the U.S. and the Netherlands. The goal is to advance our understanding of change in complex systems where results may lead to improvements in the way we access, interpret, and care for art.  Where successful, resulting development of advanced technologies for detection of trace colorants, stand-off chemical sensing, and empirical and predictive models of materials alteration and change, at multiple time scales, can be important drivers for innovation in fields that range from forensics and security to high performance coatings.

    The eight-week IRES experience will be centered at the Atelier Building (Ateliergebouw) in Amsterdam, a core facility that brings together the University of Amsterdam, the Rijksmuseum, the scientific research arm of the Cultural Heritage Agency of the Netherlands, the Delft University of Technology, and the Netherlands Forensic Institute. In addition to the Dutch expert mentors from these institutions, collaborations with scientists at major U.S. museums such as The Art Institute of Chicago, The Metropolitan Museum of Art and the National Gallery in Washington, D.C., will ensure timely focus to the IRES students' examination of technical questions related to identifying and characterizing important works of art.  With access to cultural heritage scientists who are leaders in their field, the IRES participants are expected to contribute to the central theme of understanding and monitoring change in complex systems, including these areas: 1) microanalytical tools in art and forensics, 2) change and reactivity in complex paint systems, and 3) imaging and data mining.  Upon return to the U.S., IRES participants are to present the results of their work at the Gordon Research Seminars on Scientific Methods in Cultural Heritage Research and at professional meetings in the sciences and in conservation.  Overall, this IRES will contribute to a globally engaged U.S. science and engineering workforce, capable of excelling in interdisciplinary and international research environments, where science can be transformative.

    will send at least nine undergraduate science students and three postdoctoral
    fellows to Germany to conduct nanotechnology research at the Karlsruhe Institute
    of Technology (KIT). Three students and a postdoctoral fellow will go each summer
    for the duration of three consecutive years. The work involves the development
    of a versatile nano-scaled detection tool that could provide a high societal impact.
    In Germany, Doane students will work in the labs of Dr. Michael Hirtz and Dr.
    Pavel Levkin, both well-known internationally for their expertise on nano-scale
    phenomena. The undergraduate students will receive extensive research training,
    as well as culture and language preparation at Doane College before their departure
    to Germany. While in Germany, the research team will be given an in-depth orientation
    to the country and the research setting at KIT from the project?s Principle Investigator
    and the international collaborators. Through the PI, the student team will also
    be linked with investigators at the Center for Nanohybrid Functional Materials
    at the University of Nebraska in Lincoln, Nebraska. The students, who are relatively
    isolated in the US heartland, greatly benefit from the exposure to a culture abroad,
    providing a new experience for them. The project provides increased student, post-doc
    fellow, and faculty understanding of the collaborative research process, as well
    as potentially motivating undergraduates to continue their studies and/or careers
    in science, technology, engineering and math. \n\nPart 2:\nThe research collaboration
    with the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) in Germany will advance a technology
    called DETECHIP (short for detection chip). This is a proven sensor technology
    based on differential responses of colorimetric and fluorometric sensing elements
    upon exposure to small molecules of interest, such as drugs of abuse, explosives,
    and pesticides. \n\nDETECHIP is evolving from a macroscale, liquid-phase-testing
    array utilizing a 96-well plate to a micro-scale, solid-phase array through the
    use of piezoelectric and inkjet printing. Seeking to further miniaturize and optimize
    DETECHIP, this work will incorporate Dip-Pen Nanolithography (DPN) that is available
    at KIT for micro-to-nanoscale array fabrication on novel polymeric surfaces. In
    collaboration with the KIT collaborators, the Doane investigators will incorporate
    the chemical sensors onto amphiphilic nanoporous (HEMA) polymeric surfaces that
    are produced at KIT.\n\nThe goal is the uniform fabrication and analysis of arrays
    for the detection of small molecules. Expected deliverables include: 1) a small
    micro-to-nanometer-scaled, polymer-supported DETECHIP array; 2) methodology for
    bench-top or portable analysis with the best imaging and/or read-out technology
    to be determined during this project period; and 3) reports documenting the efficacy,
    ease of use, and cost effectiveness of the resulting DETECHIP technology.\n\nThis
    international collaboration sets the stage for US post-docs and undergraduates
    to apply for German Humboldt, Fulbright, and DAAD-RISE fellowships, while German
    KIT students can participate in academic exchange programs with Doane College."

    Part 1
    This NSF IRES grant will provide undergraduate students with a rich international research opportunity in both microbiology and biogeosciences through their examination of unique 5,000-3,000,000 year-old permafrost sediment samples previously collected in the Northeast Siberian Arctic. Twelve students over the course of three summers will spend a total of six weeks at the Soil Cryology Laboratory of the Institute of Physicochemical and Biological Problems of Soil Sciences (IPBPSS) within the Russian Academy of Sciences and complete their research projects under the supervision of academic mentors from both IPBPSS and University of Tennessee Knoxville. The project will give these students an integrated research experience including educational guidance and cultural enlightenment, while strengthening research collaboration between U.S. and Russian scientists.

    Part 2
    Permafrost occupies approximately 25% (23 million km²) of the Earth's continental surface in the Northern Hemisphere, yet its microbiota remains largely unexplored. The microbial communities embedded within permafrost for millions of years represent a ?gold mine? of genes encoding for low-temperature biocatalysts involved in biosynthetic and biodegradative pathways. Research projects of the students participating in this IRES program will be devoted to studying the biodiversity, as well as the interactions between microbial diversity, functional activity and physicochemical properties, within deep subsurface permafrost sediments. The proposed research will apply various state-of-the-art techniques such as qPCR, DNA hybridization, geochemical analyses, and metagenomics, in addition to traditional microbiological and analytical approaches. This research will fill in gaps regarding the taxonomic and functional diversity of the Siberian permafrost and contribute to the international knowledge about permafrost ecosystems. The broad dissemination and availability of metagenomic data from different permafrost strata will supply considerable knowledge to our understanding of the microbial ecology of polar regions with respect to both permafrost degradation and its impact on global warming.

- abstractText: "Technical description \nThis International Research Experience for
    Students (IRES): Research Opportunities in Continental Rift Initiation for U.S.
    Undergraduate Geoscience Students in Malawi will allow students from Oklahoma
    State University (OSU) to investigate the geodynamic processes involved in the
    initial rifting of the continental lithosphere. There is a knowledge gap for   understanding
    the mechanisms involved at the earliest stages of continental rifting that is
    \  ascribed to the paucity of data from nascent rift environments. Our understanding
    is incomplete as to where and why continental rifts initiate and to the relative
    role of pre-existing structures in rift initiation and strain localization. The
    Malawi rift is one of the world?s best places to study the interplay between neo-tectonic
    rift structures and Precambrian basement structures during the initiation and
    propagation of continental rift. It is also a natural example of how major structures
    in the crust try to find the most efficient pathway through a complex array of
    inherited structures.   \n\nOver the next three years, 12 undergraduates from
    OSU will work with mentors and peers from the University of Malawi and the Geological
    Survey Department to conduct field-based, multi-disciplinary research on the geodynamic
    processes at play during rift initiation. This research expects to answer the
    questions: what is the role of pre-existing structures in the localization of
    strain during the early stages of continental extension, how is strain partitioned
    and accommodated throughout the upper crust during the early stages of continental
    extension, and how are fault dip, slip, and displacement/length ratios modulated
    by pre-existing structures. The research sites in Malawi afford IRES students
    the opportunity to do original research. Student projects will focus on detailed
    investigations of the rift border faults, transfer zones, and the nature of the
    upper crust using broadband magnetotellurics, gravity, magnetic, structural, and
    remote sensing surveys and analyses. \n\nBroader description \nA major goal of
    this IRES is to attract underrepresented students to the geosciences and inspire
    them to develop the critical thinking skills needed to succeed in research careers
    as geoscientists. The geosciences are considered the least ethnically diverse
    of all scientific disciplines. As an international research experience, this project
    could have significant impact on the development of future international research
    collaborations. These could be seeded as a result of interactions with African
    peers, from the enriching cultural experience, and the acquisition of personal
    contacts that could contribute to building relationships upon which future international
    research collaborations could be initiated. Results of this research will reach
    a broad audience as student participants are required to present their individual
    research findings at regional, national, and international scientific meetings,
    and potentially publish results in peer-reviewed journals. \n\nOther broader impacts
    include the enrichment of the geophysical and structural databases for Africa,
    since IRES students will acquire geophysical and structural data that will have
    the potential to transform current geodynamic understanding of continental rifting.
    Lastly, since continental rifts are prolific hydrocarbon producers as are active
    tectonic sites, the results of the student projects could provide scientific input
    into sustainable resource management for natural resources and environmental hazard
    mitigation efforts in Malawi."

- abstractText: "Technical Description \n\nWith the rise in global population and
    rapid growth of urban and coastal areas worldwide, providing clean water is a
    major challenge particularly when basic sanitation needs are not met. Water scarcity,
    poor sanitation, and economic disparity tend to characterize many densely populated
    urban areas throughout the world. There is no doubt that new solutions are needed
    to improve the availability of clean water and basic sanitation for underserved
    populations. Moreover, solutions that also recover energy and resources for net-zero
    impact have the potential to lessen the burden for communities dealing with water
    scarcity, and energy and food security issues.\n\nConsequently, there is a need
    to improve fundamental knowledge on decentralized wastewater systems technologies
    (DEWATS) that lead to net-zero energy and resource use. IRES students from San
    Diego State University and California State Poly-technical University in Pomona
    will contribute to fundamental research in collaboration with the University of
    KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN) on biological and physico-chemical processes in DEWATS and
    resource and energy recovery from wastewater. Students will use traditional methods
    (microbiological techniques, water chemistry and solids analyses) and novel applications
    of fluorescence spectroscopy to evaluate the performance of an anaerobic baffled
    reactor (ABR) with water reuse for agricultural applications. This IRES project
    aims to be a transformative scientific and cultural experience for US students
    that will advance fundamental knowledge of ABR and other DEWATS treatment processes
    implemented at the full-scale in South African communities.\n\nBroader Description\n\nThis
    project is a unique opportunity for environmental engineering undergraduate and
    graduate students to visit the UKZN in Durban, South Africa, where they will conduct
    fundamental research on resource and energy recovery from wastewater, new perspectives
    on wastewater treatment, and sustainable sanitation. Over the course of the three
    year project, fifteen US students will be supported to work on novel research
    at the nexus of water, energy, and food with a focus on decentralized wastewater
    treatment systems in growing urban centers. Students will be mentored by active
    research faculty at the Pollution Research Group at UKZN and obtain an enriching
    international experience on topics highly relevant for environmental scientists
    and engineers.\n\nThis research experience will equip upper-level undergraduates
    with research skills needed to transition to graduate school and strengthen the
    research and mentoring skills of graduate student participants. The US student
    cohorts will be recruited from groups, including those underrepresented in environmental
    science and engineering, at San Diego State University and California State Poly-technical
    University in Pomona. A pre-departure orientation program is designed to promote
    team building, cultural sensitivity, and adequate preparation for students to
    conduct collaborative research internationally. As part of the evaluation of this
    project and for knowledge transfer from cohort-to-cohort, exit surveys will be
    conducted and videos of the research and student perceptions will be disseminated
    to subsequent cohorts. Participants will present their research at UKZN and at
    local and regional research symposia, professional society meetings, or conferences.
    IRES participants will conduct outreach for K-12 audiences via after-school programs."

    In this International Research Experience for Students (IRES) project, U.S. graduate and undergraduate students under the supervision of Professors Mary T. Rodgers of Wayne State University and Peter B. Armentrout of the University of Utah will participate in international collaborative research projects with Dutch counterpartners and institutions to investigate the roles of metal ion interactions in biology, energy and catalysis, and the environment.  The biological, catalytic, and environmentally oriented mass spectrometry and spectroscopic studies they carry out are expected to add to the rapidly growing and evolving research areas that interest a broad community of researchers. Each U.S. cohort will be assigned collaborate on several projects, with each student acting as the lead researcher on a particular project.  Outcomes from this IRES are expected to contribute to the underpinnings of these methodologies and add to their continuing development, while contributing to STEM workforce preparation.

    Twice a year for three years, U.S. student cohorts will travel to the Netherlands for month long research visits to participate in cooperative research projects that make use of unique Dutch instrumentation (laser systems and mass spectrometers) and cyber infrastructure at the Free Electron Lasers for Infrared eXperiments (FELIX) facility at the Radboud University Nijmegen.  The FELIX facility in the Netherlands is an international user facility supported by an advanced technical staff as well as faculty, students, and postdoctoral fellows associated with the university. Planned experiments are designed to measure directly the infrared spectra of the metal-ligand complexes, thereby providing structural and mechanistic information through the analysis of the observed photodissociation pathways along with concomitant theoretical work. Because the FELIX facility welcomes a wide variety of researchers from around the globe, IRES participants should benefit from an exceptional, early career opportunity to interact with Dutch partners as well as researchers from other institutions and countries.  Theoretical calculations, additional data analysis, and preparation of the results for presentation will continue after the students return to the U.S., culminating in the expected outcome of scientific publications, under the guidance of the U.S. PIs and Dutch mentors.  Pre- and post visit surveys along with a three-year follow-up survey will be administered to assess the success of this IRES program. A website for this U.S.-Netherlands IRES program will make the results of the program available to participants, the broader scientific community, and the public.

    summer research program at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH), in Stockholm,
    focuses on colloidal science and interfacial engineering. Led by the prinicpal
    investigator, Ilona Kretzschmar of CUNY City College (CUNYCC), with Swedish counterparts,this
    interdisciplinary program encompasses research from traditional science and engineering
    disciplines and brings together qualified students from diverse backgrounds for
    a ten week program for early career research experience. Projects will range from
    biological colloids to new materials for energy storage and conversion, as well
    as fundamental science projects that address the assembly and interactions in
    the colloidal domain.  Overall, the IRES program at KTH intentionally relies on
    an  interdisciplinary team approach to train both graduate and undergraduate participants
    to be able to adapt to new disciplines, learn from each other, and to gain more
    global perspective and access to cutting edge colloidal science and interfacial
    engineering.\n  \nThe U.S.-Swedish research experiences for participants run for
    an annual ten week period and entail mentoring by the PI and counterparts centered
    in three major divisions of KTH, in Surface Science and Corrosion, Biotechnology,
    and Chemical Technology. To examine colloidal science in the broadest sense, planned
    activities range from work on compression of molecular and colloidal layers at
    interfaces and the measurement of colloidal interaction via the synthesis of biomolecules
    and sequencing of genes, to the fabrication of colloidal batteries and fuel cells.
    Prior to the actual research experience, IRES scholars receive research training
    at CUNYCC laboratories, meet with previous scholars, and network with Swedish
    exchange students in residence at CUNYCC. During the initial research experience
    abroad, students remain in touch with the PI via a combination of weekly and monthly
    reporting and video conferencing.  The PI spends the final weeks of the program
    at KTH with the IRES participants to interact with mentors, ensure individual
    progress, and prepare for a cumulating conference in collaboration with the NYC-Louis
    Stokes for Minority Participation (NYC-LSAMP) Program through which many IRES
    students are recruited.  KTH is ideally suited for a diverse IRES program as it
    educates a significant share of Sweden's engineering students and is a well-known
    Swedish public institution with an outstanding research portfolio and a student
    body similar to that of CUNYCC. The overall success of this cooperative and diverse
    IRES program is built on technically strong intellectual partnering and a mutually
    benefical working program structure that has proven successful in promoting synergy
    among lead researchers and excellent early-career team experiences for U.S. and
    Swedish student participants."

    and research programs at three research-intensive institutions including North
    Carolina State University (NCSU), Pennsylvania State University (PSU), and the
    University of New South Wales (UNSW) in Australia. Under the direction of a UNSW
    foreign mentor, each of six student participants will complete a 10-week individual
    research project that contributes to the overall research theme. The newly established
    Center for Dielectrics and Piezoelectrics, a collaboration between NCSU, PSU and
    corporate members, will also be leveraged in order to provide thematic research
    projects and training experiences that are of broad interest, additional presentation
    opportunities for students, and complementary undergraduate research opportunities
    in the U.S. \n\nA global sustainable energy future requires the advancement and
    implementation of new materials for energy storage and conversion and the concomitant
    development of scientists and engineers who exercise an ability to see bigger
    problems and create global solutions. The unifying research theme of Materials
    for Energy Storage and Transduction will promote the development of sustainable
    energy technologies and human capital in this area of global need. \nThe IRES
    project develops human capital in the sustainable energy sector and advances the
    understanding of phenomena and materials that underpin sustainable energy technologies.
    Through their projects and activities, U.S. students are trained to be global
    scientists and engineers who leverage global resources and seek diverse perspectives
    and expertise. The activities also establish an international network of cooperating
    scientists and engineers from three different research-intensive institutions
    on topics of high societal relevance. The marketing and recruitment activities
    of the project will enable and encourage applications from the most competitive
    and diverse student applicants. Through these activities, the project will continue
    a strong track record by the investigators of engaging women and persons from
    underrepresented groups in undergraduate and graduate research projects. The results
    of the work will be broadly disseminated at national and international conferences
    and undergraduate research symposia and published in core, disciplinary journals.\n\nTechnical
    description \n\nStudent research projects will be focused on material polarization
    phenomena that enable the storage of electrical charge and its conversion between
    mechanical, thermal, and other forms of energy. The dielectric and piezoelectric
    materials that rely on polarization phenomena are critical to a variety of energy
    systems ranging from the small (microelectromechanical, microelectronic, and wireless
    communication systems) to the large (electric cars and smart grids). To accomplish
    their projects, students will be trained in and utilize state-of-the-art instrumentation
    and modeling approaches at UNSW including, for example, scanning probe microscopy,
    cathodoluminescence spectroscopy, X-ray diffuse scattering, confocal laser scanning
    probe microscopy, and density functional theory modeling. In addition to their
    foreign mentors, the students will interact with faculty and academics at NCSU
    and PSU who have a vested interest in advancing knowledge and training students
    in these research areas."

    lead a three-year International Research Experiences for Students (IRES) project
    supporting collaborative research projects by 18 U.S. graduate students with scientists
    from the InterUniversity Institute (IUI) in Eilat, Israel. The project provides
    international research opportunities related to coastal zone sustainability to
    US graduate students in the geosciences. The project also trains these students
    in the processes required to formulate, design and conduct original research overseas,
    an essential skill for today?s scientists who must function effectively on multi-national

    on coastal zone research, covering the complex ecosystems extending from fresh
    water systems to near-shore ocean systems. These ecosystems face numerous challenges
    and offer significant research opportunities of global importance. The students
    will work with well-regarded Israeli researchers and will use the excellent facilities
    of the IUI located on the Gulf of Aqaba. A total of six students per year over
    three years (18 total students) will participate in this summer research program
    in collaboration with scientists from IUI. \n\nThis project is somewhat unusual
    in that a clear research plan for the students is not defined at the outset. However,
    this is also a crucial strength of the project, since students will develop the
    skills needed to perform independent, globally oriented research. Students will
    apply by preparing their own proposal for a summer research project in Israel
    that complements their ongoing thesis work in the US. Students who are accepted
    will then further develop the idea in collaboration with the selected Israeli
    investigator over the course of a quarter-long planning course. The U.S. students
    will get first-hand experience in skills essential for their long term scientific
    success:  constructing scientific research questions that link local and international
    coastal zone sustainability issues,  initiating interactions with non-U.S. scientists,
    collaboratively designing and executing a research plan, dealing with logistics
    related to work overseas, communicating and disseminating results jointly with

    This IRES award will provide research experiences to undergraduate students from Western Kentucky University (WKU) in South Korea at Pusan National University and Changwon National University. The WKU students will work on projects in biochemistry and analytical chemistry with the PI or Co-PI and respective South Korean collaborators. The PI, Professor Moon-Soo Kim from WKU, and Professor Haesik Yang from Pusan National University will collaborate on the use of sequence-specific Zinc Finger Proteins (ZFPs) and Transcriptional Activator-Like Effectors (TALEs) for the detection of pathogens. They seek improvements in detection sensitivity for this technique by using electrochemical detection with redox cycling. The development of a point-of-care diagnostic for pathogen detection is expected from this project. The Co-Pi, Professor Eric Conte from WKU, and Professor Yong-Ill Lee from Changwon National University will collaborate on the use of Magnetic Zirconia particles for the separation of chiral racemic drug mixtures. The separation of chiral racemic mixtures is a challenge in biomedicine where typically only one enantiomer will have biological activity. Magnetic zirconia particles show promise for separating a number of important racemic mixtures and subsequent isolation of the biologically important chiral molecule. Separating and isolating the pharmaceutically active chiral substance is important for studying a drug?s metabolic route.

    A strengthened joint collaboration, involving WKU undergraduate students, will result between the WKU investigators from a predominately undergraduate institution and Korean collaborators at two internationally recognized Ph.D. granting institutions (Pusan and Changwon National Universities). In addition, this experience is designed to expose students to education within a different cultural milieu.  They will gain an appreciation for higher education in a country other than their own and gain research experience in an international environment. Also, a greater cultural appreciation will result.  WKU students will work in the laboratory of the PI or Co-PI during the academic year and visit their host Korean University during the summertime. Qualified underrepresented students from WKU will be given priority for this overseas visit, including students from nearby Appalachian counties. These students will be least likely to have the means to visit a foreign land and in general lack exposure to diverse cultures.

- abstractText: "Technical description. \nThe proposed International Research Experience
    for Students (IRES): Coupled Geomechanical Processes and Energy Technologies -
    Research Experience at Ecole des Ponts Paris Tech -  ENPC, France (?CGPET - ENPC?)
    aims to expose Georgia Institute of Technology (GT) undergraduate and graduate
    students to geomechanical research applied to energy technologies, immerse them
    in the academic culture of a leading European institution (ENPC), and inspire
    them in the pursuit of a scientific career to improve the sustainability and security
    of energy sources and production. Undergraduate and graduate students from Georgia
    Tech School of Civil and Environmental Engineering (GT-CEE) will complete a two-month
    internship at ENPC Navier Laboratory, to work on research planned and supervised
    by dual ENPC and GT-CEE faculty mentors. Navier Laboratory gathers world?s experts
    in theoretical poro-mechanics and thermodynamics, and has unique experimental,
    imaging and computational facilities especially adapted for geomechanics. Topics
    of study envisioned in this IRES involve fundamental research in the physics of
    thermo-hydro-chemo-mechanical coupled processes in geomaterials, multi-scale modeling
    of porous networks, three-dimensional image analysis and advanced numerical simulation
    techniques. The ?CGPET-  ENPC? program will start with five teams of dual mentors,
    who will work on the following subjects: (1) Clay nano-poromechanics for carbon
    dioxide sequestration, (2) Characterization of particulate pore structures for
    geological storage, (3) Micro-mechanical modeling of fatigue in salt rock for
    Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES), (4) Reactive fluid injection and withdrawal
    in rock, for oil and gas recovery and geothermal energy systems, and (5) Freeze/thaw
    cycles and sulfate attacks for improved cement-based buffers. Every year, a GT-CEE
    mentor will spend the last week of IRES participants? internship at ENPC, to work
    with his/her ENPC collaborator and supervise GT-CEE students? final research presentations;
    similarly the ENPC mentor will spend the week following the internship period
    at Georgia Tech. \n\nBroader description. \nFundamental understanding of soil,
    rock and cement-based materials is needed to address society?s most pressing needs
    in energy production (e.g., hydraulic fracturing, geothermal systems), energy
    storage (e.g., CAES) and waste management (e.g., nuclear waste disposals, carbon
    capture). Through their engagement in a project aimed to improve energy geotechnologies,
    IRES participants will discover the responsibility of researchers towards their
    sponsors, their scientific community and society at large. Students selected for
    this CGPET ? ENPC program will have an international experience as part of a cohort
    through cultural and professional activities, and will contribute to build and
    maintain a global network of scholars through public research presentations at
    ENPC and GT, wikipage postings, academic publications, and mentoring of new IRES
    participants. Currently, most students enrolled in Civil and Environmental Engineering
    discover soil mechanics during their senior year, through the course of Introduction
    to Geotechnical Engineering. Activities planned before, during and after the ENPC
    internships will expose a broad population of GT students to geomechanical research,
    which will provide opportunities to inspire and attract more students in the pursuit
    of a scientific career. The integration of activities for faculty and undergraduate
    and graduate students from ENPC and GT-CEE is expected to sustain long-term collaborations
    between groups focusing on experimental, theoretical and numerical research in
    energy geomechanics. This IRES will also serve a broader effort to share knowledge,
    expertise and resources between Europe and the United States, and to explore new
    ways to initiate scientific collaborations between high-ranked education and research
    institutions around the world."

- abstractText: "This US-Spain IRES project further develops and expands research
    and training opportunities related to the anthropology of culture and heritage
    in Europe successfully launched in the 2010-2013 NSF-funded CHESS program (OISE-0968575).
    This project will provide an early-career international research experience for
    fifteen (15) undergraduate and graduate students from the University of Massachusetts
    Amherst and the Five Colleges consortium. The PI and co-PI will recruit three
    cohorts of students to conduct systematic, comparative research around the theme
    of \"Cultural Heritage in European Societies and Spaces (CHESS)\" as part of a
    three-year research project and training program in collaboration with the Department
    of Anthropological Sciences at the University of Barcelona in Spain. For each
    of the three years, research projects will be organized around a central research
    stream: highlighting specific strengths of the US and Spanish faculty: 1) \"Crisis,
    culture, and heritage\" (2013-2014); 2) \"Sustainable heritage, communities, and
    economies\" (2014-2015); and 3) \"Social Justice, heritage, and changing forms
    of value\" (2015-2016).   Students will be trained through a course series in
    research design and methods, field research in Europe, and data analysis and writing
    for publication.  International research and training workshops at the two universities
    will provide US students with intensive mentoring from renowned European scholars,
    as well as networking and collaboration with their international peers.  \n\nIntellectual
    merit: Anthropologists have critically engaged the concepts of culture and heritage
    for decades, but the rise of the field of heritage studies offers new opportunities
    for ethnographic investigation of how these central disciplinary concepts are
    being used by policymakers, citizens, and other social actors. By developing their
    projects in relation to a central set of research questions, students will contribute
    to three key areas of inquiry for the larger comparative investigation of culture
    and heritage as sites of contestation, conflict, and cohesion in Europe. The proposed
    CHESS program provides an integrative framework for an ethnographic field school
    that will draw the participation of students across the four subfields of anthropology
    (cultural, linguistic, archaeological, and biological) and serve as a model for
    interdisciplinary research teambuilding. \n\nBroader impacts: Government institutions
    face new demands to develop public programming that reflects our nation's diverse,
    multicultural heritage, and there is a growing need for social scientists trained
    in the anthropology of heritage and related fields.  Broader impacts of the project
    include 1) training a diverse group of fifteen (15) US students for international,
    comparative anthropological research on cultural heritage policies and debates,
    2) developing scientific research networks between anthropologists in the US and
    Spain that will form the basis for further international research projects and
    ongoing relationships, including synergistic initiatives between the UMass Department
    of Anthropology, and new certificate programs in Heritage and Society Studies
    and Modern European Studies, the Five Colleges consortium, and European partner
    institutions; 3) collaborating with faculty and students from Spain to produce
    a body of systematic, comparative research on debates surrounding heritage management
    in Europe, including research reports, peer-reviewed publications and conference
    presentations, project-related theses, and multimedia case studies for use by
    community organizations, policymakers, and classroom instructors. These publications
    are available to the general public through a CHESS project website professionally
    archived by the UMass Amherst library.  Holding an international CHESS workshop
    at UMass Amherst each year of the program further extends the broader impacts
    enabling at least 30 U.S. students to develop international professional networks,
    mentoring relationships, and collaborators."

- abstractText: "This NSF International Research Experiences for Students program
    will provide support for a total of 12 Ph.D. students pursuing dissertation research
    in several subdisciplines of chemistry at the University of Notre Dame to do research
    in any of three closely aligned laboratories in Sweden. Four students will be
    selected each year during this three-year program to spend four summer months
    pursuing research on a unified theme of development of new enantioselective catalysts.
    Initial emphasis will be placed on catalysts for the synthesis of chiral amines,
    which represent a broad class of compounds of importance as pharmaceutical products,
    agricultural compounds, and small molecule probes in molecular biology and biochemistry.
    The mentors, who have collaborations amongst themselves and with Notre Dame faculty
    members, are Professor Per-Ola Norrby at Gothenburg University, Professor Pher
    Andersson at Stockholm University, and Professor Jan-Erling Bäckvall at Stockholm
    University. They are world leaders in the development of computational methods
    for prediction of enantioselectivities of chiral transition metal catalysts, the
    development and characterization of new metal catalysts, the evaluation of catalyst
    performance, and the use of molecular biology methods to develop new peptide-based
    catalysts. They will direct IRES student projects in these areas of specialization,
    blending computational studies with experimental chemistry and the tools of molecular
    biology to develop new transition metal- and peptide-based enantioselective catalysts.
    Quantum mechanics calculations will be used to define structures of transition
    states for selected reactions employing chiral metal catalysts. The calculated
    transition states will be used to generate force fields that will be applied to
    the in silico screening of chiral catalyst libraries to predict enantioselectivity
    of new or previously known catalysts in advance of their preparation and experimental
    validation.  Molecular biology in the form of directed evolution will be employed
    for developing complementary peptide-based catalysts. The combination of these
    capabilities in the three program laboratories is unique and brings powerful new
    tools to bear on catalyst development.  The specific IRES student projects interface
    well with research programs at Notre Dame and will be of interest to Ph.D. students
    having dissertation projects in synthetic organic chemistry, inorganic chemistry,
    organometallic chemistry, analytical chemistry, materials science, biochemistry,
    and molecular biology. \n\tThe participating students will gain experience with
    advanced computational and experimental methods for small-molecule and polypeptide-based
    catalyst development.  The students will present their research in an international
    setting, and write reports and manuscripts for publication in scientific journals.
    Upon returning to the Notre Dame, the participating students will be encouraged
    to apply their newly gained knowledge towards their dissertation research projects
    and, with their dissertation directors, to maintain collaborations with their
    Swedish mentors to pursue further aspects of their IRES projects. The collective
    IRES experience will prepare the participants for careers in an increasingly competitive
    technological world in which scientists are expected to have multiple skills and
    to succeed in an international setting.  Moreover, students will be personally
    enriched from immersion in a different scientific and societal culture.  In the
    national interest, the research outcomes of this IRES project, namely development
    of new enantioselective catalysts, can be translated into improved production
    of pharmaceuticals, agricultural agents, and chemical tools for use in biochemistry
    and molecular biology. These areas are long-standing strengths of the U.S., applicable
    to large-scale manufacturing of products for both domestic use and export. Retention
    of these strengths requires training of students who can contribute their expertise
    in an increasingly competitive, technologically based, global economy."
