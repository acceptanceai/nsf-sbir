    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will be the development of high-performance all-carbon reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) column packing material. Customers of the $1.3 Billion/year HPLC column market include life science, biochemical, industrial, nutritional safety, environmental, agricultural, process engineering, academic and governmental organizations. Reversed-phase columns account for the majority of HPLC column market. Upon market entry, our technology will attract customers whose analysis requirements fall outside the capabilities of current silica- (Hydrophobic alkyl chains typically comprising of 18 carbon atoms (C18) bonded to silica support) or graphitic carbon-based columns as well as those who are seeking faster more efficient analysis at a lower cost. It will also attract customers seeking next-generation performance capabilities for separation of structurally similar compounds, biologics, biobetters or biosimilars. Molecules would include geometric isomers and diastereoisomers (e.g., chiral drugs such as thalidomide), biogenic (e.g., catecholamines or other hormones that are modulated in many neurologic disorders such as Alzheimer Disease). Macromolecules include structurally similar compounds (e.g., hemoglobin variants in sickle cell anemia) and many drug metabolites (e.g., glucuronide in opioid metabolites) and drugs of abuse (e.g., cannabis).

    This SBIR  Phase I project proposes to establish the technical feasibility of a chemically-crosslinked all carbon column material for reverse phase HPLC.  Chromatography technology plays a key role in the development of life-saving pharmaceutical products and medical therapies, ensuring the safety of our food and water, protection of our environment and guarding public health. Reversed-phase HPLC columns employ a hydrophobic stationary phase. Typical silica-based reverse phase HPLC columns are not durable, are challenged by elevated pH and temperature and lack sufficient retention for highly polar and closely related structures. The newer graphitic carbon HPLC columns are prohibitively expensive and neither scalable nor functionalizable for improved selectivity. Our technology's key differentiator is at the molecular surface level, where our novel proprietary fabrication technology directly connect carbon nanomaterials with covalent bonds, producing scalable all-carbon column materials. Our overall objective during Phase I is to identify the optimal column packing conditions and characterize the chromatographic performance of the columns as a function of pH and temperature and ability to separate structurally similar small compounds and biologics. Successful completion of the proposed research and development plan will allow us to finalize highly differentiated all-carbon nanomaterial column prototypes that will offer unparalleled chemical and thermal stability, best-in-class recovery, excellent separation efficiency and increased column longevity at a significantly lower cost.

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase I project focuses on the development and demonstration
    of a new high resolution X-ray detector to be utilized (initially) in medical
    diagnosis. The early work by NGS Detectors and collaborators has shown an improvement
    in resolution by a factor of almost 10 over the X-ray detectors in current use.
    The focus of this Phase I project is to now improve both the resolution and efficiency
    of the detector (in order to reduce the x-ray dose received by patients). The
    initial diagnostic application is for mammography, where the improved resolution
    is expected to allow accurate diagnosis of suspicious features in the breast at
    an early stage, while reducing the false diagnoses (both positive and negative)
    that are recognized to be problematic. The detectors have potential application
    in other medical diagnostics situations, such as neonatal and cardiovascular fields,
    where the higher resolution is expected to extend the application of X-ray diagnostics
    well beyond current practice. Applications for industrial nondestructive evaluation
    in fields such as semiconductor manufacturing are also envisaged. \n\nThis SBIR
    Phase I project focuses on the development and demonstration of a new high resolution
    X-ray scintillation detector. The indirect detector utilizes a new polymeric scintillating
    polymer developed by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories for security applications,
    and incorporates the material into an optical channel plate. The optical channel
    plate contains an ordered array of high quality capillaries (e.g. 10 micron diameter).
    The scintillating polymer absorbs X-rays, and emit photons that are channeled
    to pixels of an optical detector with minimal scattering. A resolution of 10 micron
    has already been demonstrated, an improvement of nearly an order of magnitude
    over both direct and indirect detectors in current use in medical diagnostics.
    The focus of Phase 1 is to complete the detector characterization, with a special
    emphasis on improving the detector efficiency in order to minimize X-ray dose
    rates for patients. The successful completion of Phase I will lead to a Phase
    II that demonstrates that the higher resolution indeed yields higher feature discrimination
    in realistic diagnostic situations.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission
    and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
    intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable a safer, more reliable, and more efficient electric power grid. The power grid is critical infrastructure on which all of America's economic sectors depend, and so its reliability and stability is of the utmost importance. The technology being developed is the ideal modeling and simulation platform to analyze and predict grid abnormalities and blackouts due to its unprecedented ability to simulate complex systems accurately. Its physics-based simulation engine can incorporate more detailed models of loads on the grid, thereby allowing system operators to better assess grid state and stability. The proposed technology is also uniquely capable of modeling distributed energy resources at the transmission and distribution scale, an industry need that has been deemed critical to increase the penetration of renewables on the grid. The technology has substantial potential for commercial impact, as there are thousands of transmission, distribution, generation, and consulting organizations that are potential customers. Combined, these factors can help enable a more robust, secure grid that operates with reduced cost and emissions. This Phase I project represents the first step in making this technology a commercial reality.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project represents a significant departure from traditional methods that are used to model the electric power grid. The team's foundational research has already shown that the technology can simulate the U.S. Eastern Interconnection (half of the U.S. transmission grid) from any initial condition to evaluate complex contingencies - capabilities that are not possible with existing tools. The current- and voltage-based formulation used in the model is more flexible than is used in traditional power systems simulation software, enabling more realistic physics- and/or measurement-based models for more accurate simulation results. The Phase I project includes developing a secure and robust cloud platform for the technology that supports parallelized grid analyses, with a full library of component models and an intuitive web-based interface. This will enable system operators, utilities, and consultants to improve their planning studies and operations by enabling more accurate simulations at a higher throughput than is possible with today's software. The work done in Phase I will serve as a foundation for future advancements in power grid modeling and simulation, including integrated transmission and distribution system analysis and statistical analysis to assess the impact of uncertainties on the grid.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project seeks to reduce the cost and complexity of incorporating energy-saving phase change materials (PCMs) into end-use products by developing a new class of form-stable PCM-modified resins that contain a unique reactive-polyolefin component. Importantly, the development of new PCMs for the passive thermal regulation of electric vehicle (EV) batteries has the potential to increase EV safety, range, and affordability, representing an addressable market currently valued at $87m and that is growing at 20% per year. Validation of these advantages should significantly benefit society by increasing electric vehicle performance and reducing the frequency of expensive battery replacement, thus increasing the adoption of energy efficient vehicles and reducing green-house gas emissions. This project can also result in an increase in the penetration of energy efficient PCM technology in additional markets worth a combined $370m, including building materials, textiles, electronics, and packaging, which can have a large positive economic impact on society. Finally, successful realization of the goals of this SBIR Phase I program will further enable scientific / technological understanding of PCMs that are based on organic materials.

    The intellectual merit of this project is the validation of a new paradigm for a bottoms-up approach to the design, production, and optimization of structurally-well-characterized reactive polyolefins of tunable molecular weight and narrow polydispersity that possess superior performance and stability characteristics as organic phase change materials (PCMs) for waste heat management as compared to conventional paraffin-based PCMs that have remained virtually unchanged for the past half century. To achieve this goal, reactive polyolefins that are the best candidates for commercialization will be identified through optimization of molecular structure, stereochemical tacticity, and the temperature and kinetics of main-chain and side-chain phase transitions. Reaction variables will also be optimized to provide the highest yields of reactive polyolefins under industrially-relevant and scalable process conditions. The development of PCM-modified thermoset resins based on reactive polyolefins will provide access to commercial waste heat management applications that employ physical constructs obtained from casting or injection molding and should benefit from lower production costs, a wider range of applications, and greater long-term stability.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to develop a delaminated zeolite-based catalyst to facilitate more economical and environmentally friendly propylene-oxide (PO) production.  PO is a commodity chemical with a $5.6B/year market.  The two current pain points for PO producers are (i) that the currently used industrial catalyst lacks long-term stability under the harsh conditions at the tail-end of the PO synthesis reactor, and (ii) as a result of catalyst deficiency, that the process to manufacture PO consumes an extra $140M of raw materials per year, separate from the problem in (i) above.  Berkeley Materials Solutions developed a catalyst for the tail-end of the PO synthesis reactor that nearly eliminates both of these problems. The catalyst allows for nearly 100% conversion of all raw material into PO, which leads to $145 M/year of additional revenue for PO producers, corresponding to a revenue increase of 8.6%. This increased revenue comes at no additional cost since it is a drop-in replacement.  In addition, there are significant energy efficiency improvements associated with recovering the currently lost raw material in the PO synthesis process, which amounts to a CO2 footprint of ~740 kilo tons of CO2 per year worldwide.

    The intellectual merit of this project will be represented by the development of a generalizable crystalline catalyst platform to replace existing amorphous catalysts. Technical hurdles that will be addressed in the proposal are (i) the successful delamination of a layered zeolite precursor using a swelling method and sonication, (ii) establishing a sonication-free scalable delamination method for layered zeolite precursors, and (iii) the insertion of catalytically active heteroatom sites into the delaminates frameworks. If successful, this will enable the economical production of these zeolite catalysts for application in the PO synthesis reactor under flow conditions. The targeted scales even during Phase I activities are large enough to enable testing in collaboration with industrial partners who manufacture propylene oxide at large scales. These test results will be used to optimize the prototype catalyst.  The results from Phase I activities will help to uncover other possible opportunities to use delaminated zeolites as highly efficient catalysts for chemical manufacturing.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the rapid, cost-effective detection of natural gas leakage to improve public safety, mitigate global climate change, and decrease product loss.  Natural gas is the largest provider of power in the United States.  However, more than 80 Tg of leakage occurs at well pads and pipelines during production alone.  Such leakage poses a public health risk, with 1300 significant incidents reported from 1997 ? 2016, resulting in 50 fatalities, 180 injuries, and $2B in costs. Additionally, methane is a greenhouse gas with a warming potential that is 84 times higher than CO2.  In 2015, natural gas leakage accounted for 198 million tons of CO2 equivalents, corresponding to a carbon tax value of more than $2B.  Finally, energy companies want to reduce leakage to avoid product loss, with 80 Tg of methane having a value of $12B.  This project will directly impact the aforementioned areas by improving the efficiencies and costs associated with natural gas leak detection.  With over 2.2 million miles of local utility gas distribution pipelines 1.2 million well pads in the U.S. alone, the commercial prospects for an improved natural gas leak detection system are very promising with expected revenues exceeding $70M.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will involve the development of a comprehensive natural gas leakage detection solution that integrates compact, low-cost sensors with state-of-the-art analytics.  The solution, which can be used in drone-based and handheld monitoring, will enable energy providers to detect natural gas leakage from well pads and pipelines.  In Phase I, technical feasibility will be demonstrated by the development of a lightweight gas sensor based on incoherent, cavity-enhanced spectrometry and a natural gas camera based on filtered infrared imaging. These sensors will be integrated with global positioning system, wind speed/direction, and data analytics platform.  The Phase I solution will be laboratory tested to characterize its analytical performance, before undergoing field testing on controlled natural gas leaks.  In Phase II, the sensor hardware, electronics, and firmware will be refined to meet the stringent size, weight, power, and environmental constraints of drone-based and handheld deployment.  Likewise, the analytics platform will be refined to incorporate the STTR sensors, interpret the infrared camera data, and provide comprehensive leak detection reports.  The Phase II prototypes will be field tested under real-world conditions with a variety of potential customers for both well pad monitoring and pipeline distribution system monitoring.

    This SBIR Phase I project will explore the potential benefits of a sine wave shaped wheel compared to a traditional circular wheel for the central pivot irrigation industry. The central pivot irrigation industry is an essential segment of the agriculture industry and this project aims to deliver a superior wheel that solves the persistent issue of trench-digging that leads to equipment breakdown, down time, lost profits, and crop-loss. The broader significance of eliminating trench-digging would be significant savings for farmers, distributors and consumers. Agriculture is the largest industry in the world, and developing a wheel that eliminates an issue that plagues the industry is the central goal of this project. The development of a sine wave wheel also potentially impact other fields as the technology can be used in over one-hundred different industries.


    The technical innovation of this project is creating a wheel that is non-circular. The wheel will exhibit the blending of multiple shapes in one design including a sine wave, cube, circle and hexagon. It will be approximately 4.5 feet tall, and weighing approximately 400lbs for use in the farming industry. The concept is to create two wheels in tandem where the sine waves are out-of-phase from one another. The front wheel would create a left-right-left path into the soil, much like the path a snake would leave behind traversing soil. The rear wheel would move in an opposite right-left-right configuration leaving a double helix footprint in its wake. The opposing wheels would push the soil back toward center, eliminating the largest issue plaguing the industry: trench digging. The sine wave wheel technology has already been scientifically proven on a smaller scale in the skateboarding industry to reduce friction, increase longevity, increase off-road ability, and increase speed. Multiple wheel iterations will be manufactured and subsequently tested in this project using off-the-shelf hubs within the industry and rubber tires. The wheel will not be pneumatic and will never go flat.

- abstractText: "This STTR Phase I project will support the development of a powerful
    new track-and-trace platform in the global fight against counterfeit products
    in high-risk supply chains. From pharmaceuticals to aviation to defense, many
    industries now face a growing problem with maintaining visibility to the authentic
    products in their supply chain, while identifying black market and grey market
    products that could harm their customers and have serious impacts on national
    security. This project will build on interdisciplinary research from materials
    science, photonics and information technology to create an innovative new platform
    that connects physical supply chains with digital supply chains through the use
    of covert codes that are placed onto products. These codes are printed using  nanoparticles
    that are only visible when exposed to a laser with very specific properties. The
    security platform that this research enables will provide U.S. industry with a
    robust new system for authenticating genuine products and maintaining visibility
    throughout the global supply chain. \n \n\nThis Small Business Technology Transfer
    Phase I project develops a system designed to thwart counterfeiting.  The system
    is based on 1) covert printed markings, carrying encoded information, that convert
    near infrared (NIR) excitation either to visible light or to shorter-wavelength
    NIR light, and 2) a proprietary reader-decoder system that is cyber-enabled to
    access secure data bases. The two major technical challenges addressed in this
    project both involve maximizing the overall signal-to-noise ratio of the system.
    \ The first challenge improves the long-term stability and up-converting nanoparticle
    payload-capacity of a novel, micro-emulsion (aqueous continuous-phase) ink. The
    second challenge creates micro- or nano-scale substrates that greatly amplify
    the up-conversion signal. Successfully overcoming these technical hurdles will
    significantly advance the readiness of the technology for commercialization and
    Phase II development. It is estimated that reaching the milestones specified within
    the specific research objectives will lead to a 250x enhancement of up-conversion
    intensity when using low excitation power densities. Such an enhancement would
    be transformational to the system and enable the use of lower laser powers in
    the reader/decoder device which in turn, would lower costs and greatly extend
    the utility of the system to, for example, a hand held, portable reader."

- abstractText: "This STTR Phase I project aims to develop a novel microfluidic sensor
    technology that can measure blood coagulation times (specifically prothrombin
    time-PT, measured in international normalized ratio-INR) at point-of-care (POC).
    PT/INR has to be monitored frequently for millions of patients on oral Warfarin
    (an anticoagulant that prevents clotting) to keep them in a safe therapeutic range.
    The POC sensor developed in this project is expected to provide PT/INR measurements
    independent of factors influencing the blood counts of the patients, making it
    safer and more accurate. The technological foundation of the proposed research
    is to combine acoustic sensing with microfluidics. The preliminary data demonstrates
    that the proposed sensor can measure viscosity and density of extremely small
    liquid volumes (~ 10 nL) accurately. The successful implementation and commercialization
    of this innovation will result in a big market share in the rapidly growing POC
    coagulation test market and create hundreds of jobs. The research and development
    process during this STTR will also contribute to the full understanding of this
    technology?s potential, which can result in other self/home testing instruments
    for patients. \n\nThe proposed novel coagulation monitor is based on microfluidic
    quartz resonator sensors. Quartz resonator sensors can be used to measure changes
    in fluid viscosity or mass coupled to their surfaces (both of which occur during
    coagulation of blood) by monitoring the associated changes in the resonance frequency.
    The technology underlying quartz resonators is well established, simple and robust,
    and amenable to provide portable and compact instrumentation. The innovation here
    is the integrated microfluidics, which will bring the benefits of extremely low
    liquid volume requirements, control over how liquid is observed by the sensor
    (which can be used to enhance sensor output due to the coagulation), and on-chip
    blood plasma separation. The key objectives of the proposed research are to determine
    the microfluidics design and the surface functionalization that will optimize
    a microfluidic quartz resonator sensor?s coagulation measurement sensitivity,
    and to implement on-chip blood plasma separation for PT/INR measurements."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will be functional neuronal cells derived from human adult adipocytes that will have applications in regenerative medicine.  The goal is to develop dopaminergic (DA) neural progenitor cells (NPCs) from transdifferentiated human adult adipocytes using a DA cell induction cocktail.  This will have application in cellular therapeutics and research tools for Parkinson's Disease (PD), and other neuronal diseases. In addition, these studies will impact the field of stem cell research and regenerative medicine, since this will be the first demonstration that functional neuronal cells, the main building blocks of brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nervous systems, can be produced from mature fat cells that can be used as cellular therapeutics for several neurological disorders.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop new technology for generation of midbrain dopaminergic (DA) neural progenitor cells (NPCs) from adult adipocytes (fat cells), which will used as a platform to develop cellular therapeutics for Parkinson's Disease (PD), and PD research tools. Recently, using a chemical genetics approach (chemical approach or small molecule approach), engraftable midbrain DA neuronal progenitor cells (DA NPCs) from human bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-hMSCs) have been generated. Additionally, DA neuronal progenitor-like cells also had been produced from de-differentiated fat cells (DFAT cells) that have several advantages over BM-hMSCs such as homogeneity of DFAT cell cultures, ease of isolation and low immunogenicity. The goal of Phase I project is to validate and optimize the DA induction protocol for generation of midbrain DA NPC from DAFT cells. Phase II will focus on clinical grade manufacturing of these DA cells and testing their therapeutic effect in several preclinical animal models of PD. Commercial products emerging from Phase I/II work include cellular therapeutics for PD and research tools for PD.

    The?broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is represented by the development of a company in a unique field of single crystal growth addressing needs in solid-state lasers. Single crystal growth represents a small and highly specialized, but absolutely essential, area of modern materials technology. Solid-state lasers are commercially vital because they are compact, durable, relatively inexpensive, and field deployable in many technologies. Single crystals are essential components to solid-state lasers and thereby represent significant commercial potential.  This project will enhance the skill set of specialty manufacturers of high quality single crystals for solid-state lasers. It represents an unmet commercial need in short wavelength solid-state lasers and also will expand the technological skill set of single crystal growers. This last point is especially important, as there is a serious lack of skills, technology and infrastructure in solid state laser production in this country, and this makes the US increasingly dependent on offshore suppliers of essential materials. This program will help train the next generation of critical materials manufacturing experts in the US.

    The proposed project intends to address the development of new single crystals called Strontium Beryllium Borate (SBBO). These crystals are an enabling technology for the manufacture of short wavelength solid-state lasers lasing at and below 266 nm. Such lasers have many potential applications but at present there are no materials capable of practical performance at these very short wavelengths. This shortcoming represents a significant commercial opportunity. The project will examine production of single crystals of a new material to meet this need using hydrothermal synthesis, which employs very hot water at high pressures as a growth environment. In this Phase I project, research will be undertaken to develop a growth protocol of large single crystals of this vital material, A feedstock will be perfected, and seed crystals will be produced. Transport conditions will be optimized, and suitable temperature gradients will be identified. Preliminary evaluation of crystal quality will be performed. Suitable crystals will be sent to collaborators in the laser manufacturing industry for preliminary production of solid-state short wavelength lasers. The seed crystals and growth protocols from the research in this Phase I program will be used in a Phase II project for development of a full-scale commercial manufacturing process for this crystal.

    of a low-cost, universal detector that is capable of responding to nearly all
    organic molecules with high sensitivity and linearity. Previous attempts to utilize
    the flame ionization detector have failed because of the lack of technologies
    necessary for the complete vaporization of analytes and removal of organic solvents.
    We have identified an oxidation-reduction microreactor that converts all organic
    molecules to methane vapors. We anticipate the proposed detector will have a sensitivity
    on-par with flame ionization detectors in gas chromatography. The technology would
    bring unparalleled molecular quantification to a wide variety of industries including

    is to develop a new water flood technology to increase oil recovery.  The best
    current technology is limited to 30 - 50% recovery leaving significant resources
    in the ground.  The available methods to further increase recovery are expensive,
    have limited application and can cause environmental damage.  The proposed method
    is much lower cost and has minimal environmental impact.  Our technique does not
    use chemicals or additives thus avoiding the risk of contaminating ground and
    surface water resources.  Rather than drill thousands of new wells, our approach
    revitalizes old fields and requires little modification to the existing infrastructure
    and operational procedures.  It would allow older fields to continue to operate,
    providing revenues, jobs and taxes while increasing and further diversifying our
    domestic oil reserves.  Development of these currently unrecoverable oil resources
    could enable long-term stabilization of oil prices at reasonable levels and offer
    new business opportunities for small operators.  \n\nThis STTR Phase I project
    proposes to measure the wettability in several petroleum reservoirs and to determine
    the equilibrium constants required to better describe the interaction between
    mineral surfaces and surface-active components of crude oil.  These constants
    will be added to a geochemical model to evaluate the capability of the models
    to predict wettability.  Wettability in petroleum reservoirs is poorly constrained,
    and current formulations that depend on interfacial energy cannot accurately portray
    the observations and offer little predictive capability.  The current wettability
    measurement methodologies rely on flow properties to infer interfacial energy
    because it is difficult to directly measure the interfacial energy between rock
    and oil.  Using a geochemical approach, we can explicitly represent the electrostatic
    and van der Waals force that make up the interfacial energy.  This approach will
    produce quantitative formulations of wettability that can be implemented in standard
    geochemical models.  Our goals are to demonstrate that we can measure the important
    reactions using standard chemical methodologies, that these measurements can be
    used in geochemical models to calculate wettability and that the models can be
    used to predict wettability as a function of water chemistry, for enabling techniques
    for more effective water flooding and enhanced oil recovery."

    This SBIR Phase I project will develop key components of a next-generation lithium metal battery that greatly increases both energy density and safety compared to the best lithium-ion batteries. Such a technology has the potential to deliver significant societal value by improving the state-of-the-art in battery markets such as implantable medical devices, electrified flight, electric vehicles, and many others. In fact, improvements just in medical device batteries may cause a step-change improvement in device design and delivery of healthcare that could save tens of thousands of lives annually. This project will increase opportunities for US-based manufacturing and create jobs by leveraging existing domestic prototyping and manufacturing capabilities around the country. Once material and process costs come down with scale, this technology can also help to expedite mass-market adoption of electric vehicles, consumer electronics, wearables, and other portable devices. The proposed technology may eventually allow for the widespread adoption of sustainable electrified transportation, reduce US dependence on foreign oil, significantly reduce carbon emissions related to transportation, and build an edge for US-based battery R&D and manufacturing.


    The project addresses the key unmet challenge for next-generation battery chemistries based on lithium metal: highly reversible cycling (> 500 cycles with lithium plating efficiency > 99.7%) with high charging current density (> 1 mA/cm^2). The objective of the proposed R&D is to prove out a concept around novel metallic anode formulation that can enable unprecedented cycle life, lithium plating efficiency, and charging rate. Existing cell prototypes with pure lithium metal anodes have already demonstrated stable cycling and high specific energy at lower rates. However, inadequate lithium plating efficiency at high charging rates limits the cycle life that can be achieved in a commercial cell. Phase I research efforts will focus on two main objectives: (i) improve reversibility and efficiency of the metallic anode at high charge rates compared to pure lithium metal, and (ii) demonstrate the performance benefits in a coin cell with commercially attractive design parameters that delivers 500 cycles with minimal lithium loss at a high rate. The ultimate goal of the Phase I research is to develop a high-performance lab prototype, based on an optimized electrolyte and commercial cell components, that will provide proof of feasibility for rapid commercialization in the target market.

    and detection of breast cancer: the Quantified Self Exam. In the United States
    over 300,000 women are diagnosed and 40,000 women die from breast cancer every
    year. Breast cancer has a 99% survival rate if detected early, but limitations
    in cost, sensitivity, accessibility, and convenience of existing screening technologies
    result in one third of breasts cancers getting missed at early stages. Since treatment
    for early stage cancer is an order of magnitude less costly than treatment for
    stage 3 and 4 cancers, there is a clear economic and societal benefit for the
    development of better breast cancer monitoring and screening tools. To address
    this challenge, the technology proposed in this project leverages the proven benefits
    of ultrasound imaging and the newfound power of cloud-based artificial intelligence
    to provide a regular and accessible self-monitoring tool that can quantify and
    track suspicious changes in breast tissue. The device portability, low cost, 2
    minute scan time, and automated analysis of breast image data will greatly increase
    the accessibility of breast cancer monitoring for women, which in turn stands
    to decrease the cost burden of this disease for the US healthcare system. \n\nThis
    SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a new tool for early detection and monitoring
    of breast cancer: the Quantified Self Exam (QSE) that combines a low-cost, compact
    3D ultrasound device and positioning accessory with artificial intelligence to
    empower women and their physicians with appropriate and actionable data.  The
    QSE technology proposed in this project operates independent of user skill and
    captures 3D volumetric images of the whole breast in 2 minutes.  The system architecture
    allows for simplified and low-cost ultrasound hardware that connects wirelessly
    to a smart phone/tablet and transfers captured data to secure cloud for advanced
    image processing and storage. The ultrasound scanner attaches to a positioning
    accessory for repeatable imaging that enables longitudinal 3D monitoring of abnormal
    growth using machine learning-based image analysis. The proposed Phase I R&D efforts
    focus on four objectives: (i) optimize electrical hardware and low-level imaging
    software for spatial resolution and image quality; (ii) build a QSE scanner that
    maximizes field of view and volumetric integrity; (iii) build a positioning accessory
    for positioning of the QSE scanner; (iv) demonstrate the longitudinal repeatability
    of QSE imaging by validating the alignment of 3D ultrasound volumes on a breast
    phantom."

    This SBIR Phase I project aims to design, build, test, and refine a cartridge of medicine for use with an inkjet printer for printing medicine that was developed with past NSF ERC support for academic research and I-Corps support for market research. Similar to how a conventional inkjet printer deposits small quantities of liquid ink on blank paper, the printer deposits precisely measured quantities of medicine on blank carriers to make the final pharmaceutical product. Due to its smaller size and relatively quick production times, the printer enables and is currently aimed at personalized medicine applications, wherein dosages and other product factors are customized to individual named patients by their medical practitioner and drug products are made for the patient to suit based on such a patient-specific prescription. The detailed development of medicine cartridges has not been attempted before, and is specifically pursued in this SBIR Phase I project to demonstrate cleanliness, address potential counterfeiting concerns, provide ease of use, and provide tracking if required. Such cartridges are envisioned to enhance the impact of printed medicine for personalized medicine applications, thereby improving the level of healthcare for this nation?s ill and creating a high-value just-in-time pharmaceutical production market.

    It is technologically very challenging to adapt the cartridge concept to pharmaceutical applications. These challenges include: the need for the cartridge to maintain cleanliness and integrity during storage and in use; the need to ensure that final products match required composition and dissolution profiles; the need to ensure that the contents of a cartridge are shelf-stable over its life; the prevention of any accidental introduction of impurities or deliberate counterfeiting; and the need to preclude operator error in wrong-substance or wrong-dose dispensing. Further challenges include the need to select and optimize cartridge size and form factors. Preliminary designs for cartridges have been identified, and this SBIR Phase I support will enable such designs to be built, tested and improved. Such cartridges will be filled with both inert materials and with certain specific drug substances identified as being of commercial interest. The cartridge and printer are planned to recognize each other to prevent operator transcription error. Testing for composition and impurities is planned with standard analytical chemistry techniques used in the pharmaceutical sector, such as high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) or mass spectrometry. The end result is a robust and reliable cartridge, to transform personalized medicine for the better for everyone.

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase I project entails the development of an EEG analysis
    software application that identifies the epileptogenic zone (EZ - where seizures
    start in brain) in medically refractory epilepsy (MRE) patients. Over 1 million
    people in the US have MRE, meaning that they do not respond to medication. MRE
    patients are frequently hospitalized, burdened by epilepsy-related disabilities,
    and contribute to 80% of the $16 billion dollars spent annually in the US treating
    epilepsy patients. There are 2 treatments: (i) surgical removal of the EZ, and
    (ii) neurostimulation, where the EZ is electrically stimulated to suppress seizures.
    Successful outcomes depend critically on accurately identifying the EZ from invasive
    EEG recordings, which is a long costly process, leading to grim outcomes where
    30%-70% of treated patients continue to have seizures. There has thus been an
    intensive search for an accurate data analytics tool to reduce time, risks and
    costs of invasive monitoring. This project involves further development of such
    a tool that generates visual \"heat\" maps from EEG data. The tool, grounded in
    dynamical systems theory and neuroengineering, has been validated with data from
    20 patients, achieving 95% accuracy in predicting surgical outcomes. Reducing
    monitoring time reduces the risk of infection from the brain being exposed, and
    reduces hospital costs associated with lengthy stays and clinical staff reviewing
    data. By providing more accurate definition of the EZ, the tool will also enable
    use of a precise and entirely new laser ablation procedure that makes tiny lesions
    in targeted structures as opposed to removing large portions of the brain. If
    successful, the tool will be closer to commercialization under a sustainable business
    model. Major EEG vendors and medical device companies are looking for accurate
    software applications in epilepsy treatment to enhance their product suites, and
    will be very interested in licensing the tool. \n\nThis Small Business Innovation
    Research Phase I project involves development of a cutting-edge EEG tool that
    uses dynamic network modeling and a highly innovative and patented theory of \"fragility\"
    of nodes in a dynamic network to localize the EZ from invasive EEG recordings,
    taking into account the extensive interconnection of neurons in the brain. The
    more \"fragile\" an EEG channel, the more likely it is in the EZ. Project aims
    are to (i) validate the tool on a large patient cohort, using invasive EEG data
    before, during and after seizure events; (i) test the tool?s efficacy using noninvasive
    scalp EEG recordings and (iii) design the user-interface and integrate this application
    into the existing clinical workflow to facilitate prospective studies. These milestones
    will minimize key risks in bringing this innovation to market, which are adoption,
    perceived liability, regulatory approval and reimbursement. Adoption risk will
    be mitigated if the tool is accurate, quick and easy-to-use, requiring essentially
    the push of a button to receive fragility maps. Accuracy risk will be mitigated
    if our completed retrospective study, including refinement of network models,
    shows comparable performance to our preliminary data. The quick and easy-to-use
    risks will be mitigated with the development of an intuitive interface that importantly
    integrates with the existing EEG data acquisition and visualization tools. Regulatory
    risk is low as a predicate device exists. Perceived liability of the tool in mis-diagnosis
    is a low risk as the tool is not intended to replace the clinician's analysis,
    but rather it provides an enhanced visualization of the EEG data (as demonstrated
    in our retrospective study) already being collected and analyzed in the clinical
    workflow. Finally, reimbursement risks will be mitigated if accurate identification
    of the EZ using the tool has the potential to significantly reduce or even eliminate
    the focal MRE segment reducing epilepsy-related costs by $6 billion/year. Consequently,
    healthcare and insurance providers will have a strong incentive to pay for, or
    reimburse epilepsy clinics for the tool.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory
    mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
    intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to optimize water utilization, thereby improving agricultural production. It is projected that the human population will exceed 9 billion by 2050.  To meet the expected demand, global food production must increase by more than 50% by 2050. This SBIR project will have impact not only in expanding fundamental knowledge of plant utilization of water but also in contributing to agricultural productivity, an urgent and practical need for human survival, in a sustainable manner.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to commercialize the advanced water-treatment technology that could enhance plant growth, and therefore improve crop output in agricultural applications. In short, a thin layer (about 100 microns, as thin as a human hair) of interfacial water was found to exist with a slightly higher pH, net negative charge, and a tendency to exclude impurities. These findings were similar to those found by other independent research groups working with xylem cells in plants and muscle cells in animals. Several hydrogels and polymers were also found to contain interfacial water with similar properties. Initial studies regarding the practical use of the interfacial water were conducted in a plant system. On average, initial results show a rapid growth rate of around 10% to 20% improvement compared to the control group; preliminary findings that have now been confirmed to be similar amongst four different plants, namely chick pea, wheatgrass, basil, and pea shoots. This SBIR will enable continued testing and scale up the interfacial water generator to meet water demands for customer validations.

    \ \nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a novel insole to facilitate
    proper and timely response to a person?s movements in order to maintain good balance

    of protrusions around the insole perimeter area in response to the sudden increase
    of pressure that excites the mechanoreceptors reporting to the CNS.  Such a balance-enhancing

    This SBIR Phase I project intends to improve the outcomes of children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) by providing critical data from non-clinical settings that are currently unavailable to autism treatment providers. The project also focuses on accelerating the analysis of that data. It is estimated that the costs associated with ASD will be more than $2 million over a patient's life. However, studies have shown that the costs of lifetime care for a child diagnosed with ASD can be reduced by 2/3 with early intervention. Designing an appropriate treatment program, and then monitoring its efficacy, requires the collection of a range of data to avoid dependence on inference and anecdotes. Treatment providers often collect detailed data while working with an individual diagnosed with ASD, but they count on parents and caregivers to provide them with data regarding the child's progress outside the clinical setting. The data submitted are usually incomplete and inadequate (if submitted at all). This SBIR Phase I project will result in a prototype that will rapidly provide autism treatment providers with critical data and analysis, reducing the amount of time it takes to design an optimal treatment program, and thereby reducing the long-term costs associated with a diagnosis of ASD.


    This Phase I project will result in a prototype that will make the process of logging data almost frictionless for parents. That narrative data will be combined with video data, biometric data, and additional data collected passively from external sources. All the data will be merged, and then analyzed via machine learning to locate patterns and provide a complete picture to the child's behavior analyst. Developing a camera that will be unobtrusive enough for a child with ASD to tolerate will present a challenge, as will developing the associated software to tag items within the camera's view and save only relevant clips (such as the times immediately before, during and after a meltdown). It will also be challenging to develop a wearable device that a child with ASD will tolerate, along with the associated sensors and software to track metrics associated with arousal and stress. The most significant technical challenge, however, will be to develop the software that combines the multiple data streams and outputs a standardized ABC report (Antecedent, Behavior, Consequence) that would be judged as high quality by a Board Certified Behavior Analyst.

    This SBIR Phase I project addresses the pressing need for providing incarcerated youth and adults with continual systematic and secure personal education and training opportunities, giving inmates the skills they need to productively re-enter society. It will also reduce recidivism rates, and increase their confidence and the potential for contributing to local communities. Every year, more than 700,000 state and federal prisoners are released back into their communities, often with no greater skills than when they went in. The majority of prisoners lack basic high school degrees. The goal of the project is to provide the most effective, secure and flexible offline e-Learning applications for acquiring high school equivalency, the area of greatest need, within the constraints of the prison environment; covering both instructor-led and self-directed learning sessions. At the completion of Phase I, correctional facilities will have an opportunity to utilize a secure, easy-to-administer, offline e-Learning solution for the General Education Development (GED) or for any other education and training in a digital format. A wealth of high-quality instructional programs will be incorporated into the platform that will ultimately lead to a high school equivalency diploma, and additional support to address technical and vocational skills.

    The Phase I project innovation is centered around the delivery of a single, highly-flexible, secure learning management platform, where multiple applications can be stored on a single server. It will provide the General Education Development (GED) content and will be expandable to incorporate additional e-Learning applications including those that can address recidivism. The adaptable learning management platform will automate the provisioning and installation of these GED and non-GED educational applications on private servers, either on-site at the correctional facility or on off-site private server networks. Different sets of content would be automatically customized for each prison, with no outside Internet connectivity required. Another key innovation will be the ability to have the e-Learning system follow the inmate as they are moved. They will always have access to their specific content and progress status as their data will be centrally-hosted on the fully secured prison servers. Their individual records can be confirmed and reviewed for parole evaluations. By providing uniform student analytics and continuous monitoring of learning outcomes with different content and educational application vendors, the system will advance the capability of offline learning to be a data-driven endeavor and will deliver a personalized experience comparable to systems in civilian life.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will evaluate the technical feasibility and commercial viability of a novel sample preparation method for cryo-EM (cryogenic electron microscopy) studies.  As a rapidly growing technique in the structural biology field, the cryo-EM market as a whole is estimated to be more than $5 billion a year, with > $500 million attributed to the sample preparation space.  In spite of an overall revenue growth rate of more than 70% per year, cryo-EM sample preparation remains an area that has yet to see any major technological breakthroughs commercialized in the past decade.  In fact, the current industry solution is reported to have a failure rate of > 95%.  By providing a sample preparation system that actually works, this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will significantly reshape the massive and rapidly expanding cryo-EM market and allow scientists to more readily collect detailed protein structures in their native state.  This new knowledge on the molecular basis of cells and of life itself will be used to facilitate as well as accelerate the development of new pharmaceuticals as well as therapeutic treatments for diseases and thus greatly benefit human health in the long run.

    The intellectual merit of this project is the development of a cryo-EM sample preparation device built on the application of state-of-the-art microfluidic jet systems to deposit and vitrify protein solution on EM grids in milliseconds, which is at least 1000x faster than the current methods.  Furthermore, it offers scientists the novel ability to control the thickness of the vitrified aqueous layer and, overall, more control over the sample vitrification process.  With this new sample preparation device, a larger region of the cryo-EM grids will have intact protein molecules with the right layer thickness for structural determination, allowing researchers to save time and money in terms of both grid preparation and screening in a high-throughput manner.  Currently, the proposed technology has not been tested nor used anywhere.  Therefore, the first and foremost goal of this SBIR Phase I project is to better understand and well characterize the technical capabilities and limitations of this proposed innovation, with additional R&D work needed before product commercialization, which is expected in five years.  The project will focus on defining and optimizing both the geometric and experimental setup in order to de-risk the technology.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a novel cancer targeting technology, Active Tissue Targeting via Anchored ClicK Chemistry (ATTACK), for targeted treatment of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). TNBC is a subtype of breast cancer that occurs in 10-20% of diagnosed breast cancers and is more likely to affect younger people, African Americans, Hispanics, and those with BRCA1 gene mutation. Currently, TNBC patients are mainly treated with chemotherapeutics and cannot benefit from existing targeting therapeutics due to the lack of Estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) or hormone epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her2/neu). This project will develop the first cell labeling based targeting technology (ATTACK) for TNBC treatment. A novel unnatural sugar will be developed for cancer-specific labeling of TNBC through metabolization to insert an artificial receptor onto TNBC and then target the artificial receptor to deliver therapeutic taxanes through a specific reaction between the receptor and the taxanes-drugs. The project involves interdisciplinary combination of knowledge from chemistry, biology, materials engineering, and pharmaceutical science. The successful development of the project will afford an effective targeted therapeutic drug for TNBC patients with improved quality of life in the future.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a novel cancer targeting technology, Active Tissue Targeting via Anchored ClicK Chemistry (ATTACK), for targeted treatment of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). ATTACK can treat untargetable cancers that do not have established cell surface receptors through cancer-specific artificial receptor insertion of de novo designed unnatural sugars and subsequent azide-Click reaction mediated targeted delivery of therapeutic drugs. Currently, TNBC patients are mainly treated with chemotherapeutics and cannot benefit from existing targeting therapeutics due to the lack of Estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) or hormone epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her2/neu). This project will develop the first cell labeling based targeting technology (ATTACK) for TNBC treatment. Unnatural sialic acid (a type of sugar) precursors with azide will be first used for tumor-specific labeling on cell surface and subsequent targeting. Multiple taxane candidates will be synthesized and preliminary in vitro DMPK properties of the conjugates will be studied including solubility, plasma stability, liver microsome metabolization, and cytotoxic MTT assay. In vivo biodistribution and efficacy of the taxane candidates in combination with unnatural sugar labeling will also be studied in mice tumor models to validate the anti-TNBC efficacy of the drug candidates. The accomplishment of the Phase I research will enable further translational development of the novel cancer-targeting therapeutics into clinical applications.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable the high sample testing throughput
    necessary for quantum magnetic bioassay technology to be used for medical diagnostics,
    precision health and point of care patient care. Ultrasensitive detection of low-concentration
    biomarkers, many of which are currently undetectable by existing technology, offers
    new diagnostic capability for improved clinical decisions and better patient health.
    Existing high-sensitivity diagnostic instruments are very complex to use, expensive
    and require lengthy sample processing steps - all of which increase health care
    costs. A new class of magnetic-based assays combining high sensitivity and low
    sample processing using NV diamond quantum sensors has been developed. Magnetic
    assay platforms can deliver equivalent results to current biomarker assays faster
    and at significantly lower cost. A dramatic reduction in sample processing, combined
    with direct detection of magnetic tags, will provide rapid test results, a critical
    component for point of care diagnostics. A remaining challenge for this approach
    is delivering bioassay samples to the sensor quickly and repeatedly - a challenge
    to be addressed in this project. \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
    Phase I project will develop a rapid sample transfer mechanism to enhance the
    sample throughput of bioassays using a quantum magnetic sensor. Quantum sensing
    enables revolutionary magnetic sensitivity and spatial resolution in a modality
    compatible with biological samples. However, the sample must be delivered close
    to the diamond sensor for analysis, and transfer between samples must occur in
    seconds, all while maintaining sensing performance. Prototype sample transfer
    systems designed and fabricated in this project will implement an innovative new
    process to rapidly transition between assay samples. The hardware will be compact,
    require little power, and be manufacturable at low cost. Prototype sample transfer
    hardware developed in Phase I will form the basis for subsequent engineering of
    quantum sensor based bioassay devices, with initial applications to the research
    use only (RUO) sector, and later to clinical in vitro diagnostics. This advance
    will bridge the gap between the capabilities of quantum magnetic sensing and the
    sample throughput needs of clinical applications."

    to promote academic achievement, high school graduation and college and life preparedness
    for adolescents (middle through college students) with Executive Function (EF)
    deficits.  EF deficits are found in a variety of neurodevelopmental and medical
    disorders including Traumatic Brain Injury, Epilepsy, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity
    Disorder (ADHD), the most common childhood behavioral disorder affecting up to
    10% of youth as well as Autism Spectrum Disorder.  Youth with EF deficits struggle
    to get things done and have high school graduation, college matriculation and

    suffer from anxiety, depression, job loss, substance use and suicide at higher
    rates than their peers without EF deficits.  Research supports incentive-based
    behavioral EF remediation for deficient populations.  But availability of research-based
    EF remediation support is limited.  The proposed technology aims at enabling students
    to develop the EF skills needed to reach their academic potential and improve
    their life outcomes. The broader impact of this research is to gather rich data
    that will advance the scientific and public understanding of technology as a means

    This SBIR Phase I project aims to develop degradable zwitterionic hydrogels (DZH) as injectable soft tissue fillers. Fillers are used to replenish volumes left by surgical procedures, medical disorders, trauma, or aging. There is great need for a filler featuring superior longevity to the market-leading hyaluronic acid (HA) products, while also exhibiting better safety and reversibility than existing synthetic products. Zwitterionic hydrogels are uniquely biocompatible, physiologically stable, and can be processed into tunable injectable formulations. The key milestone targeted in this Phase I project is the achievement of proof-of-concept DZH materials that can be selectively and safely degraded with enzymes while maintaining their differentiating strengths: biocompatibility, longevity, and cost-effective production. Successful commercialization of DZH fillers will provide patients with a safe, long-lasting, cost-effective, and reversible treatment, positioning these fillers as a universal replacement for all currently available product lines. A disruptive product in the multibillion-dollar aesthetic filler market would form a solid basis for a sustainable business and ultimately enable the development and commercialization of many next-generation biomedical products.

    This project intends to show that DZH formulations based on zwitterionic polymers can meet key requirements of a next-generation injectable tissue filler. If technical targets are met, DZH products will be transformative as the first universal, long-term, and reversible tissue fillers for therapeutic and aesthetic applications. Specifically, their biocompatibility, rheological properties, selective degradability and aesthetic outcomes must meet or exceed the benchmark HA fillers, while their longevity must show key improvement over benchmark products. The main R&D activities are: (I) synthesizing and identifying strong DZH candidates based on particular gel network architectures; (II) demonstrating selective DZH degradability with minimal breakdown by tissue-specific endogenous enzymes; and (III) evaluating proof-of-concept DZH fillers to ensure they meet or exceed the biocompatibility and viscoelasticity benchmarks of HA products. DZH biocompatibility and selective degradation will be studied in vitro to prepare for preclinical in vivo studies in Phase II.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project will be the development of a detection assay to reduce the incidence of Vibrio-related infections. Infections from Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Vibrio vulnificus are the leading causes of seafood-borne infections and fatalities, respectively, and stem primarily from raw oysters. Development and implementation of rapid, accurate, inexpensive and easy-to-use testing methods would expand Vibrio data collection and enhance preventive measures by state shellfish labs (monitor harvest areas), and oyster processors and post-harvest processors (quality control at facilities). The assays will be available to users in simple, ready-to-prepare kits. These kits will make it easy for non-specialized personnel to test oyster lots still under refrigeration without disrupting logistics, and help U.S. oyster processors and post-harvest processors improve risk management tools and access export markets with restrictions on Vibrio levels. The tests also will improve environmental risk evaluations for harvest areas by state shellfish labs, FDA, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and other members of the National Shellfish Sanitation Program. The tests will be marketed in the U.S., and other large oyster producing nations.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to develop two-phase, thermostable test tube media formulations for the detection and enumeration of pathogenic V. parahaemolyticus, total V. parahaemolyticus, and V. vulnificus in oysters. The goal is to demonstrate a) > 95% sensitivity and specificity of each test with pure cultures and oyster samples; b) 24-hr detection time; c) ease-of-use of the ready-to-prepare kits, based on time, steps, equipment, materials and feedback from industry; and d) low cost. The main technical hurdles are: 1) Increasing formulation volumes for test tube assays since linear increases of agar layer volumes in test tube media formulations could impact Vibrio organism motility, and consequently detection speed and accuracy; and 2) replacing a non-heat stable antibiotic component, Polymixin B of the V. vulnificus test, with a heat stable alternative, like ampicillin or lincomycin, to improve ease-of-use.

    a novel process and platform for the aerosol synthesis of metal-oxide nanoparticles.
    When coupled with an existing aerosol deposition technology, this aerosol synthesis
    source will enable the production of the next generation of functional coatings.
    These include antireflective and self-cleaning coatings for solar modules, novel
    electrical contacts that reduce silver usage in solar cells, and thermal barrier
    coatings for windows that increase thermal efficiency. Each of these represents
    a large addressable market in need of coatings innovation: For example, the coated
    flat glass market is expected to reach $43.2B in 2025 and the metal-oxide nanoparticle
    coatings from this project are anticipated to capture at least 10% of that market.
    Beyond the commercial and related societal impacts of the project, this project
    will increase the scientific understanding of the nucleation of nanomaterials
    in the gas phase and the subsequent manipulation of nanoparticles in low-pressure
    flows. \n\nThe intellectual merit of this project lies in its development of a
    new method to synthesize metal-oxide materials in the gas phase, resulting in
    an aerosol that can be manipulated and deposited on a substrate with gas flows.
    Prior art for the synthesis of metal-oxide nanoparticles and the subsequent formation
    of films suffers from three challenges: (1) synthesis methods that utilize high-pressure
    gas-phase processes tend to create large light-scattering agglomerates that produce
    hazy films, (2) \"wet\" synthesis coating techniques can suffer from stability
    challenges, optical non-uniformities, and processes that are not easily scaled
    and (3) all methods have limited control of the optical properties of the film,
    specifically the refractive index. Synthesis of metal-oxide nanoparticles using
    the approach in this project is a promising, but under-examined and under-utilized,
    technique. It will generate unagglomerated nanoparticles of controllable size,
    overcoming the first challenge, and, with suitable aerosol deposition techniques,
    enable large-area uniform films with controllable refractive index, overcoming
    the second and third challenges.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission

    Transfer (STTR) project is the reduction of significant disease flare-ups in patients
    with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), increase in patient quality-of-life,
    and a reduction of expensive and unnecessary healthcare utilization. Current at-home
    care support for COPD patients is often completely missing or consists of action
    plans that fail to provide effective, individualized care. The alternative solution
    under development in this project is an easy-to use, personalized mobile application
    that catches disease degeneration early, tracks patient health history, and provides
    decision support to guide patients to the right medical care at the right time.
    COPD is one of the leading chronic conditions driving potentially avoidable hospital
    admissions. Pairing a mobile health management app with a smart triage system
    that provides instant healthcare guidance has the potential to dramatically reduce
    unnecessary COPD hospitalization and provide long-term maintenance treatment of
    COPD symptoms. Moreover, an easily accessible, highly accurate, convenient solution
    can empower patients to make better health decisions early. \n\nThis STTR Phase
    I project proposes to demonstrate positive impact and adoption of a mobile triage
    application for COPD patients. To date, a set of triage algorithms has been built
    and validated on simulated patient cases. The algorithms exhibited performance
    that is comparable to or better than a panel of board-certified pulmonologists.
    The next vital step is to establish the technical feasibility of a packaged, stand-alone
    mobile application. This research will focus on developing a fully featured prototype
    that is optimized for adoption, retention, and efficacy. A mix of user feedback
    and rigorous usage analysis collected through human testing will provide necessary
    insights on barriers to use, missing functionality, and consumer value. Standardized
    markers of health safety, symptom escalations, and patient quality-of-life will
    be used as metrics of product performance. Moreover, all data and conclusions
    will be subjected to peer review through publication and public presentations.
    As an additional objective, the accuracy of the algorithmic triage recommendations
    will be tested on real patient cases to further validate their accuracy and effectiveness.
    The anticipated result of the phase I procedure is demonstration that the app
    is safe (objective 1), operationally sound and optimal (phase 2), and valuable
    to consumers (objective 3).\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and

    of the total US national energy budget used for food-related energy, and high
    fresh produce loss in the developed countries due to insufficient refrigeration,
    achieving shelf life extension without cold storage or preservatives could drastically
    reduce energy costs, increase efficiency, and expand access to nutrition globally.
    \n\nThis STTR Phase I project proposes to develop, validate, and build-upon initial
    research to evaluate the feasibility and scope of a novel food processing technology.
    Traditional processing methodologies have fundamental drawbacks.  High temperature
    treatments degrade nutritional quality while altering texture and taste of end-products.
    Freezing negatively affects the reconstitution properties of fruits and vegetables,
    and requires high energy consumption throughout the food system to maintain the
    cold chain.  HPP (high pressure processing) has limitations on the enzymes it
    can inactivate, and chemical alterations from high pressure treatment negatively
    affects texture and taste.  This research proposal will use validation studies
    to evaluate the feasibility and applicability of the novel processing technique
    to a variety of fruits and vegetables.  Successful experimentation will prove
    that the application of dense phase gas at low temperatures can overcome the aforementioned
    drawbacks, achieving enzymatic inactivation, destruction of the spores, improved
    reconstitution properties, lower energy requirements, and minimal deterioration
    of taste, texture, and nutritional quality.  Such a result would actuate follow-on
    development work to validate that, at commercial scale, the new process technology
    improves upon the operational costs of traditional methodologies.\n\nThis award
    reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
    evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
    criteria."

- abstractText: "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses
    the challenges, inefficiencies and need associated with a rapidly growing precision
    glass optics market. Glass optics are currently used in a wide range of applications
    such as medical devices (scopes, diagnostics, imaging, etc.), defense (ballistic
    windows, missile domes, etc.), consumer electronics (cell phone lenses, smart
    device screens, etc.) and more. The challenge associated with this market is the
    constant need to prototype optical glass lenses during the development phase.
    Today, these glass lenses are prototyped using a combination of grinding and polishing
    processes that are costly and time consuming. The proposed (QET) Quad Element
    Technology could disrupt the glass optics industry, primarily the prototyping
    market estimated at about $300M with a rapid growth of 50% per year. The end result
    would be the much quicker availability of cutting edge technology that utilizes
    glass optics. An example would be significantly improving the arthroscopic or
    endoscopic surgical tools that drastically minimizes patient trauma and recovery
    time during a surgical procedure or even enabling remote surgery for patients
    especially in third world countries. Other societal benefits will be directly
    realized through economic growth, providing a competitive edge, and improving
    product quality and profitability.             \n\nThe intellectual merit of this
    project is to enable an innovative high productivity approach to manufacturing
    optical quality glass. The objective of this proposal is to demonstrate proof
    of concept and determine the feasibility of combining four (4) distinct elements
    in a single machining process: mechanical, chemical, photonic and thermal. The
    proposed technology, termed QET (Quad Element Technology), is the first of its
    kind in machining processes to exploit the advantages of the four elements specifically
    for material removal. Till date, these four elements have been used consecutively
    in status quo machining processes but never concurrently. The ability of extracting
    and optimizing only the advantages of these four elements will enable a faster
    (6-8x) and cheaper (3-5x) precision manufacturing process to produce glass optics.
    The primary goal of the Phase I R&D is to successfully select and optimize individual
    components for each of the four elements proposed and demonstrate a precision
    turning process on optical glass.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) project is the reduction of the cost of wind energy through a
    robust, inexpensive, and efficient vertical-axis wind turbine (VAWT). This project
    has the potential to increase global wind power production through technological
    advancements that lower installation, operations, and maintenance costs via an
    innovative design which addresses reliability and efficiency concerns that have
    previously limited the penetration of VAWTs into the wind energy market. Compared
    to the common horizontal-axis wind turbine (HAWT), the proposed technology requires
    an order of magnitude fewer components. Additionally, heavy and maintenance intensive
    components are located at ground level for ease of access. One initial market
    for this technology will be stand-alone, small-scale generation, where this technology
    will provide long-lasting, low-maintenance power for remote locations. Another
    initial market is the repowering and augmentation of existing wind turbine arrays.
    Here, this technology will be a cost effective method of revitalizing underperforming
    or aging HAWT farms. The long-term objective is large-scale, VAWT-only arrays.
    Recent scientific advances indicate that, unlike HAWTs, interactions between VAWTs
    can be beneficial, resulting in cost-effective, high-output wind farms. \n\nThis
    SBIR Phase I project proposes to address the reliability and efficiency concerns
    that have previously limited the penetration of VAWTs into the wind energy market.
    XFlow Energy's novel design utilizes a robust, stationary central shaft extending
    the length of the rotor, reducing harmful loading to the rotor structure. This
    design requires a larger central shaft than VAWTs tested to date, and the impact
    of a large central shaft on VAWT power output has not been previously investigated.
    Laboratory-scale tests will be performed on a range of geometries to analyze the
    fluid-dynamic impact of larger central shafts and the resulting changes in turbine
    performance and loading. This information will inform the design and structural
    simulation of a 500 W turbine.  This design will be prototyped and will undergo
    thorough performance measurements. Ultimately destructive testing will be performed
    to identify structural deficiencies, and the design updated appropriately. The
    objective of SBIR Phase I is to produce a 500 W turbine that is thoroughly characterized,
    can survive up to 100 mph winds, and is ready for commercialization. This design
    will inform development of a utility-scale turbine (>50 kW) which will be the
    focus of SBIR Phase II.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will result from the development of a scalable, enterprise-ready conversational AI platform that enables businesses to automate customer support requests, optimize call routing efforts to get customers to the right human support agent, generate customer self-service resources like smart FAQs, augment human staff with bot capabilities, and enable personalized recommendations to support sales and purchasing decisions for customers. Such technology is beneficial to any enterprise organization, B2C (business-to-consumer) and B2B (business-to-business), who needs to communicate to customers, employees, and the public. With rising customer service and communication costs, automation is critical for businesses to maintain profitability and competitive advantages. On a societal level, conversational interfaces democratize access to information and resources worldwide. A significant portion of the world's population lives in regions where internet access is poor and device ownership is rare. Many also suffer from physical limitations, such as impaired vision or limited motor control. Accelerating technology access through conversational interfaces such as SMS and voice has already been shown to transform quality of life for disadvantaged groups through applications in telemedicine, personal finance, and education.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to enable human-level conversational ability in machines. Teaching computers to communicate like humans is a critical step to achieving human-level machine intelligence (HLMI), also called artificial general intelligence (AGI). Current state-of-the-art approaches to automated dialog systems use a combination of supervised learning and reinforcement learning implemented with deep neural network architectures. These approaches have shown promise on toy problems in academic research, but have mixed performance in enterprise settings. This Phase 1 project extends current deep learning approaches by developing a repeatable methodology for annotating and preparing enterprise data for use in dialog systems and a scalable, grounded neural network architecture that can reference external knowledge sources with minimal manual engineering.

    This SBIR Phase I project seeks to commercialize a suite of gaze-driven training games that are designed to train attention orienting, focus, and inhibitory control. These video games are played with one's eyes, instead of a mouse or a touchscreen. By combining the gaze-driven aspect with embedded training principles, the games are uniquely effective in training attention. Attention is a foundational cognitive skill that is essential for academic success, much like reading is foundational to learning other subjects. The proposed project will result in a stand-alone system for elementary and middle schools to use in both special education and standard education programs for training attention control in children with attentional focus challenges. This product is particularly applicable for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and those with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), because their academic performance suffers from their attentional challenges. A key technical innovation for this project is the development of a suite of assessments that provide feedback on student performance on par with validated laboratory assessments of attention. The in-game assessments will be validated against the laboratory standards. At the end of this project, the suite of intervention and assessment games will be ready to deploy for testing in school settings as part of a SBIR Phase II project.


    Attention skill lies at the foundation of cognitive control and one's ability to scaffold successful classroom learning, yet existing laboratory tools to accurately measure attention's many facets are out of reach of the teachers and educators on the frontlines. This SBIR Phase I project brings innovation to the standard methods of attention assessment by creating easy to use assessment tasks that attract the attention of school children and whose validity will be compared to gold-standard lab assessments. This will make accurate assessment of attentional function more reliable even when delivered without an assessment expert present, and this project opens the market for attention training games that can show unbiased, quantitative improvement. This innovation will be broadly useful to allow a wide range of individuals to assess attention, but this specific project seeks to commercialize lab-quality attention intervention games for use by educators in schools with a software suite featuring interleaved assessment and training. This approach will provide feedback for school staff as well as ensure that the next steps in attention training are appropriate for the learner's current skill.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to transform 2-way, mobile satellite communications from a niche service (affordable to less than 0.1% of the world?s people), to a broadly accessible mass market product (at costs well under $1/month).  Communications devices (that could be as small as vehicle key fobs) will communicate modest volumes of data to and from virtually anywhere on Earth.   The number of potential applications is large, with the following being a few examples:  every lifejacket on every commercial aircraft and cruise ship could transmit its location and status (in the event of a mishap); children and the elderly could be tracked globally; and drivers could be assured of assistance wherever they travel.   Secondary impacts would include an increase in average fuel efficiency when, for example, more vehicles are sold without spare tires (as drivers have more peace-of-mind regarding the possibility of being stranded).   The United States will benefit in terms of improved safety, conserved resources, stimulus to the satellite and related industries, and increased export revenues.

    The proposed project centers around a combination of innovations that exploit inherent (but previously unutilized) capabilities of existing satellites.  Currently operational Mobile Satellite Systems have communications architectures that do not lend themselves to low-cost transmission of small volumes of data.  By starting with a blank sheet of paper and rethinking the architecture, costs can be reduced by orders of magnitude (for both the communications devices and the data service).  The cost reduction of the terminal devices is primarily driven by lower data rates (with associated lower power and size).  While most technical aspects of communications links improve with lower data rates, one characteristic emerges as a constraint on the extent to which data rate can be reduced.  The purpose of this research is to study this characteristic, called phase noise, and its impact on the communications performance at low data rates when using real satellite links.  The results of this research will be quantitative conclusions regarding the trades between data rates, the cost impact of lowering phase noise in the communication elements, transmission performance, and the modem architectural options.  This study will enable optimization of this trade when developing the follow-on commercial products.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will investigate the use of novel photo-switchable adhesives in medical dressings to improve patient safety, hospital compliance and potentially change the standard of care in the field of adhesive dressings. The proposed work differs drastically from other research endeavors to create dismantlable adhesives, whose drawbacks include high costs, difficulty to scale, biocompatibility issues, and inability to effect switching in application within short times. This new research offers advantages of significantly lower costs and easier scale-up using readily available adhesive industry infrastructure. Medical adhesive dressings that easily lose peel adhesion addresses a significant unmet need for preventing medical adhesive related skin injuries (MARSI), a prevalent but under-recognized injury that affects 7% of all patients across all age groups and healthcare settings. MARSI causes about 1.5 million injuries annually in the US alone and it is estimated that MARSI caused $850M in payments withheld to hospitals due to low patient satisfaction. This project is pursing the creation of a medical dressing that addresses these concerns while being cost competitive, easy to use and most importantly, safe to the patient's skin. Prototype medical dressings will be characterized and tested based on customer requirements.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project presents a novel adhesive technology platform where use-case characteristics at application are decoupled from end of life/removal characteristics through photo-switching. Photo-switchable medical adhesive dressings that lose peel adhesion upon application of light address a significant unmet need for preventing medical adhesive related skin injuries (MARSI), a prevalent but under-recognized injury that affects 7% of all patients across all age groups and healthcare settings. The proposed work differs drastically from other research endeavors to create dismantlable adhesives as the proprietary photo-switchable molecules enable change in human safe conditions and in short time frames. The proposed Phase 1 SBIR project would evaluate different proprietary multifunctional crosslinkers to increase the speed of the photo-switch by about 50% to meet clinician needs. This would be followed by experimentally evaluating methodologies to fabricate adhesive lined films for optimal optical switchability at different thicknesses and for different substrates. Finally, the learnings from the above two steps about adhesive coated films will be combined with an existing skincare lamp to demonstrate proof of product. Product performance will be characterized and tested to optimize performance based on customer requirements.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to establish faster, less expensive, more accurate ways of determining the contents of biological samples leading to novel medical diagnostics, new drugs, and other new products beyond the reach of the current scientific methods that employ mass spectrometry. The project will develop technology that enables better software for mass spectrometry, and will make mass spectrometry-based sample analysis more accessible to a broader segment of academic and industrial scientists, disrupting a $100M market. Advanced software is required to transform raw experimental data into the lists of molecules and quantities needed to create new drugs, discover diseases and increase food production. The successful completion of the aims of this proposal will enable the development of software built for the next generation of mass spectrometry, providing user-friendly, fast cloud software built on advanced, high-information algorithms.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop novel, high-information software technology for mass spectrometry data processing. The proposed work in Phase I will provide proof-of-concept for prototype development and testing in Phase II. The research will address three critical technical hurdles that are prerequisites to prototype development: 1) A mass spectrometry data storage and retrieval architecture sufficient to handle significantly more information from the hundreds of files in a typical study, 2) cloud-optimized versions of mass spectrometry information extraction algorithms, and 3) a cloud-based model-view controller framework that overcomes web-specific challenges for mass spectrometry data processing. The goal is to allow more experiments in the same amount of time without increasing costs, identifying more molecules than existing methods from the same experiment, and detecting molecules that are less abundant and go undetected by current methods.

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project will serve two complementary unmet market needs
    by: (1) accelerating the evaporation rate of brine ponds and enhancing salt production
    efficiency by 2-3 times; (2) condensing the moisture evaporated from contaminated/salty
    water so that one can obtain clean drinking water with n consumption of electricity.
    We will develop an enhanced solar vapor generation strategy based on a patent-pending
    electricity-free solar thermal technology. Specifically, we will develop/optimize
    functional materials to enhance the solar-driven vapor generation rate. The target
    is to double or even triple the salt production of mining companies relying on
    evaporation of brine ponds exposed to natural sun and wind. We will work with
    selected industrial partners to perform the field test in lithium brine ponds,
    which is the key source material for future Lithium battery industry. In addition,
    by condensing the evaporated moisture, we will aim to produce clean water using
    low cost materials and systems, which is a promising and sustainable solution
    to address the global drinking water scarcity using affordable electricity-free
    products in coastal and resource-limited areas. \n\nThe proposed project will
    aim to commercialize a patent-pending technology to realize an enhanced solar-driven
    water evaporator, which is highly desired for both solar mining production and
    clean water generation. Due to the superior solar energy absorption, heat conversion,
    and thermal insulating properties of our disclosed structure, most of the absorbed
    energy can be used to evaporate surface water with significantly reduced thermal
    dissipation. Remarkably, our pilot system has realized a record solar thermal
    conversion efficiency of >88% under illumination of 1 kW/m2 with no solar concentration.
    The corresponding vapor generation rate is ~1.28 kg/m2/h - a full 3X higher than
    the natural evaporation of bare water surfaces in the same environment. This Phase
    I SBIR effort will aim to overcome the remaining technical barriers for material
    and system optimization and scaling up strategies for manufacturing. By comparing
    the roll-to-roll coating and direct dying processes in this proposed research,
    we will select the best overall technology to complete our supply chain for the
    production in Phase II. In particular, we will perform field tests by working
    with solar mining industrial partners as well as Non-Government Organizations
    (NGO's) to get their feedback on how to improve the product in relevant environment. "

    This SBIR Phase I project will examine a new ultra-rapid 3D printing technology designed to break down important barriers to the future of Additive Manufacturing. The subject is a machine and materials set that can provide exponentially faster object generation at high resolution. This system leverages several familiar technologies in a new way to provide a path for 3D printing, generally considered reserved for the high-tech sectors, to become accessible to everyone. Because the new method is so rapid, detailed, and the materials are so diverse, it is poised to enhance plastics manufacturing profit margins by eliminating mold costs in many cases. In this way, many American business forced to outsource overseas will be able to maintain domestic production and increase the return of manufacturing jobs to the US. In addition, the manufacturing of the consumables will also enhance job creation. When this new method is fully adopted, its use in the medical field will make lifesaving and life enhancing prosthetic, implantable, and pharmaceutical testing applications much more cost effective, fundable by Medicare, benefiting all our citizens. By servicing a higher percentage of the general plastics manufacturing $600B industry, as well as professional designers, engineers, technical professionals, and the medical and scientific community, the new system in its many forms will eventually be of benefit to nearly every industry in the US, increasing the growth and practical value of the 3D market sector.


    The subject invention is unique in its use of multiple disciplines simultaneously. As a solid-state system, pressure-biased build material presses up against a glass screen, which is micro-porous, and is laced with the same kind of electronics as are found in flat screen displays. The discrete addressing normally reserved for video images, known as row-and-column refresh rates, is instead used to activate resistive material generating micro-heat spots in this open weave configuration. The heat stimulates the build material to transit the glass and solidify topside, at 1000 dpi resolution, or 1 million droplets per square inch. These high-resolution droplets conjoin and cool, as an entire layer is created at once at 30-120 times a second with no mechanical heads tracking back and forth. The objects should seem to simply appear on the glass at about one to seven vertical inches per minute, depending on the refresh rate, at virtually any planar size, and can be used right away, since no post-curing treatment is needed. Integrating an activated video matrix to build entire cross sections at once, increases speed exponentially. The pores in the glass rely on the known science of Microfluidics, a highly refined means of moving an entire 2D matrix of liquid, to eliminate costly and slow mechanization, and will be studied in this application. Robust and diverse materials have been developed for many embodiments and will be tested. Optimizing first in Multiphysics simulation, and then fabricating a simplified Proof of Concept in Phase I, should provide compelling evidence for continued work on this novel method in Phase II.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will primarily benefit the 11.4 million people with hand amputations worldwide. By making and selling a prosthetic hand at a price lower than competing devices, the proposed prosthetic hand is expected to be more affordable for people with upper limb amputations. Increasing robustness by incorporating compliant materials should allow patients to use their hands longer without worry of damage. By incorporating pressure sensors, the team expects to enable patients to precisely manipulate many different types of objects. Two former war veterans with amputations have already been enabled with early versions of the proposed technology. Through the low cost of the device and the advanced features unique to the hand, the goal of this project is to help the millions of hand amputees worldwide to regain independence and confidence in their lives through innovative prosthetic devices.

    The proposed project involves development and evaluation of an affordable, robust myoelectric prosthetic hand that provides natural, compliant grasps with pressure feedback to users. Making the hand compliant will require the use of soft, compliant materials not used in currently available commercial prosthetic devices. The design and materials used in the hand must be robust enough to last at least two years of daily usage. Finally, sensorizing the hand will require placing pressure sensors and electronics in the fingers that also need to withstand impacts. Feasibility will be established through the performance of each design iteration in accelerated life tests (150,000 flex/extend cycles) and human subject experiments (performance after activities of daily living and motor control tasks). The capabilities of the Phase I prototype will be extended in Phase II for delivery of a complete myoelectric prosthetic hand system that is ready for clinicians to use with patients.

    This SBIR Phase I project will develop an innovative 3D medical imaging technology for early-stage detection and analysis of cancers, initially focusing on detecting pre-cancer cervical lesions. This project will advance from creatively assembling existing active optics hardware to inventing a new microfiber-based active optics system to circumvent limits of space confinement and 3D resolution. The project's fundamental strategy for identifying pre-cancers of the cervix, which relies on a macroscopic 3D digital analysis combined with microscopic cell evaluation, is naturally amenable to artificial intelligence technologies. The versatility of this imaging platform enables the resolving of medical diagnostic challenges in wealthy settings and the resolving of cost-saving barriers in resource-limited settings. The imaging technology can be extended beyond medical practice to other scientific and industrial disciplines. Potentially, this project has an immediate impact on saving lives and costs via the early detection of fatal diseases. Additionally, the data and knowledge acquired developing and implementing this imaging system provide opportunities to meaningfully develop new computational strategies for educational, engineering and industrial interests. The innovative, commercially viable, platform technology offers opportunities for significant, tax-revenue-generating global profits, for future technology application spin-offs, and for producing high technology jobs for U.S. citizens.

    The project innovation will voyage from state-of-the-art 3D software development to the creation of a new type of fiber bundle imager with an electronically controlled actively focusing lens. Combined, these tasks achieve the creation of a miniaturized 3D imaging system capable of navigating confined spaces within the body, such as inside the cervix opening. For all prototypes developed for this project, final 3D renderings are enabled by proprietary 3D rendering software, capable of quantifying tissue color, volume and shape at the macroscopic level, while also evaluating cell size and approximate shape at the microscopic level. In wealthy settings, this system would be desirable for implementing a single-phase cervical cancer screening strategy to replace the current two-phase approach, which requires Pap smear and/or human papilloma virus assay, followed by the more expensive colposcopy in the case of an abnormal result. In resource-limited regions and/or regions with difficult-to-reach populations, where it is challenging to get patients to return for a follow-up visit, the technology would offer a low-cost, pre-screening method that only requires a single visit. This 3D imaging system could be combined in the future with a therapeutic agent administered at the time of diagnosis, thus offering a single-visit, screen-diagnose-and-treat method.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    Research (SBIR) project encompasses the development of a continuous fabrication
    process to enable production of larger volumes of the next generation of agrochemical
    compounds. Although the first focus is on utilization for efficient delivery of
    antimicrobial and antifungal crop protection chemicals, this platform can be applied
    for actives and biologicals with other functionalities. The broader significance
    of this research and development effort entails the following aspects: First,
    in addition to agricultural crop protection products, the delivery system developed
    here is expected to find commercial applications in many products targeted to
    the consumer, construction markets, and healthcare. Second, the formulation of
    benign small structures that have the potential to replace a wide range of persistent
    and harmful nanoparticles in various industrial settings will enhance scientific
    and technological understanding of scalable processes on the nanoscale. Third,
    the sustainable solutions developed in this project could strengthen existing
    natural resources, enhance biosecurity of the U.S. food supply, and improve public
    health. \n\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes to engineer an innovative system
    for efficient delivery of agricultural actives. To increase productivity, current
    agricultural practices utilize large amounts of crop protection chemicals. However,
    the intensive use of agrochemicals creates environmental threats damaging natural
    resources and potentially causing climate change. To address these challenges
    we are developing innovative, breakthrough platform technology with potential
    to increase efficiency of farming with the same or fewer inputs, while protecting
    the environment. The goal of this work is to create a new class of scalable, functionally
    active, sustainable and eco-friendly materials based on the widely available,
    biodegradable and bio-renewable resource lignin. The first objective of the project
    is to build a continuous flow process for preparation of lignin particles functionalized
    with small amounts of active biocides. This research will establish feasibility
    for continuous formulation of these preparations. The second objective of the
    study includes characterization of the new formulations using a series of antimicrobial
    and antifungal assays. As a result of the Phase 1 effort, technical risk will
    be reduced by identifying the most promising formulations for field studies to
    be conducted in Phase 2."

    This SBIR Phase I project will study novel methods for extracting and recovering valuable metals from an abundant industrial waste source, namely coal combustion fly ash. If successful, the technology developed in this project has the potential to reduce the environmental and societal risks of both newly generated- and legacy coal combustion wastes, while strengthening the supply chain security of raw materials critical to advanced technology and green energy applications. Moreover, by establishing a secure long-term supply of affordable scandium, this project can catalyze long-lasting improvements in commercial and personal transportation. Demonstration of this highly-selective, solvent-free metal separations technology may also influence a paradigm shift in the metallurgical industry towards more sustainable practices. Validation of technologies for waste utilization and value creation is an attractive avenue for transitioning coal-dependent regions towards economies based on advanced manufacturing and high-tech jobs.

    Previous attempts to extract metals from industrial wastes have suffered from technical limitations that the technology developed in this project overcomes. Based on commercially-available engineered polymer supports, our suite of adsorbents exhibits REE-selective functionality across broad pH regimes, enabling flexible, complementary deployment and high rates of reagent recycle. The goals of this project are to translate the laboratory-scale synthesis schemes for our novel adsorbents to greener, industrially-scalable chemistries and to demonstrate a holistic system prototype that validates the key unit operations of our process together. The former will be accomplished by following well-established protocols of the chemical industry under the supervision of our commercial partner and the latter through extensive, dynamic subsystem testing and finally construction and operation of a lab-scale prototype. The project team expects the final deliverable of this development effort to constitute a high-fidelity demonstration of the process at a Technology Readiness Level of 5.

    This SBIR Phase II project deals with the development of a gamified educational platform meant to excite and inspire children to learn about the sciences through the medium of cooking. By engaging students with interactive content in K-8 classrooms, after school programs, and special education settings, the proposed innovation aims to simultaneously accomplish three outcomes that are important to K-8 students' education and healthy living. These outcomes include: (1) helping students develop a highly practical skill (cooking), (2) generating excitement about and enhancing learning in several scientific disciplines (particularly nutrition science, STEM, and human geography), and (3) promoting a highly desirable behavior in students (the development of healthy eating habits). This project proposes to develop a prototype version of the innovative educational technology. It builds upon an existing proof-of-concept application that integrates nutrition science (in the form of cooking recipes) with human geography (different countries and cultures) and significantly enhances this application by innovatively linking the cooking-related content to a STEM curriculum and testing the addition of a variety of capabilities meant to increase user engagement and learning through the application. This Phase I proposal will research the feasibility and usability of the product, and investigate the extent to which the proposed technology is able to simultaneously achieve the three stated outcomes in a way that outperforms traditional paper-based school curricula. With the market for mobile learning products valued at $12.2 billion, the company's three-pronged approach to improving learning and health-related outcomes for K-8 students stands to generate significant revenue. The team estimates that the business can reach roughly 2 million in sales in the first three years following the product?s launch.

    The proposed research will explore (1) various ways for the system to automatically link cooking concepts with STEM concepts in a way that enhances learning and engagement and produces a curriculum compliant with Next Generation Science Standards, (2) the application of emotional intelligence to data gathered, such that the technology will track students? mood and food choices, and provide suggestions based on an optimal match between the two, and (3) the use of adaptive learning to effectively deliver the above curriculum in a targeted and personalized manner (including accommodations for children with special needs during Phase II). These outcomes will be achieved by creating and testing new capabilities for the system, including the ability to monitor user performance, a points-based progression system, personalization, customized STEM games, and matching students with recipes and lesson plans based on their culinary preferences and emotional moods, the majority of which will be implemented via the use of machine learning. Overall, the goal of the small business is to develop several different app features that incorporate the above-mentioned approaches, and to determine, through repeated and rigorous classroom testing with K-8 students, which combination of features maximizes the learning and behavioral outcomes that the application is targeting.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is the development of a cost-effective, environmental and economically sound Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) production facility based on a finite number of horseshoe crabs (HSC) using minimally impactful and novel bleeding procedures.  The goal is to address the demands of an estimated $114 million LAL market and finished kit market in excess of $1 billion per annum. Success of this project also anticipates exceeding current standards by ensuring biomedical and pharmaceutical manufacturing compliance with fewer total horseshoe crabs than the number that die annually from current practices. New approaches to HSC bleeding developed in this project would also enable repeated, controlled bleeding while maintaining optimal conditions for animal vitality and for the adjacent communities. Assuming optimized, scalable HSC bleeding operations could eventually expand current supplies, innovative applications could be developed. For example, early detection of sepsis could help avert some $30 billion in direct care every year in the US, notwithstanding the potential to save countless lives with development of gram-negative screening tools for hospital acquired septicemia.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop an alternative method of bleeding horseshoe crabs (HSCs) for Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) harvest. The overarching objective to demonstrate the proof-of-concept of an implantable, and surgical-grade device engineered to facilitate routine bleeding, without compromising the integrity and well-being of the HSC. This will be achieved via a systematic study of HSC bleeding outcomes to investigate whether such a device can meet the sterility and quality standards of traditional approaches, while obviating the need for extraneous transport to expensive, inland bleeding facilities. Furthermore, the commercial opportunity and feasibility of the device paired with a habitat-based, enclosed system to systematically monitor HSC wellbeing will be investigated. This SBIR Phase I project would be the first to investigate an alternative approach to bleeding HSCs, a technique that has not changed significantly since the late 1800's. At scale, the proposed approach would also be expected to improve product quality and traceability, and ultimately the bottom line of companies producing LAL kits, given a surplus of LAL in the supply chain.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to make non-pharmacological treatment of depression accessible to all patients. According to the World Health Organization, 350 million individuals are affected by depression. In the United States, depression affects 16 million people and it costs $210 billion a year in lost productivity and care for the illnesses related to the disease. Antidepressant drugs are coupled with negative side effects and they are ineffective in 30% of the cases. Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) is an FDA approved non-invasive method for depression therapy that consists in the administration of short electromagnetic pulses on patient?s scalp to stimulate regions of the brain involved in mood control. This SBIR Phase I project will help the generation of a new rTMS system that will improve outcomes of depression treatment by stimulating deeper brain cells and reducing the incidence of pain and discomfort associated with current rTMS therapy. The new device will allow broad distribution of rTMS based therapy for both professional clinicians and, in the future, home-care settings. It will avoid reliance on drugs to people affected by depression and it will reduce the impact of depression on society.

    The SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop and demonstrate the efficacy a new wearable rTMS stimulator device. Although rTMS has a 75% success ratio on depressed patients, 40% of subjects report pain, headaches and discomfort during therapy with current rTMS systems, resulting in a high dropout rate. This is mainly due to poor localization of electromagnetic pulses with commercially available rTMS devices. The new system will combine a new technology that stimulates the brain?s deepest regions involved in depression with unprecedented precision and a new protective shield designed to ward off unwanted heat away from the head, reducing scalp pain and discomfort. The project will develop and validate the efficacy of these components and their integration into a wearable helmet. The project will also demonstrate the superiority of the new device over current gold standard rTMS solutions. The company expects that this research will lead to the generation of a new device capable of treating depression patients through precise stimulation reducing over 40% the unwanted heat, thereby preventing headache and scalp discomfort.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project include development of a commercial proof-of-concept percutaneous directional microwave ablation (MWA) applicator which may provide medical practitioners a new approach for treating cancer. In clinical use, a directional MWA applicator will facilitate both procedural and technical simplification of MWA treatments, saving time and critical resources in hospitals, and ultimately improve quality of, and access to, cancer treatment for a broad range of patients. The research and development proposed in this project will enhance scientific and technological understanding of miniaturized MWA antennas capable of radiating with directional patterns. Specifically, special materials to reduce required antenna dimension and increase efficiency, and advanced antenna designs to maximize the size of directional ablation zones will be studied during this project. Commercial development of the proposed technical advances could expand their use for the treatment of other medical conditions or for applications in other industries such as wireless communications. This STTR Phase I project will contribute to the creation of technology jobs in Kansas, a region where there are few medical or technology companies.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to develop a commercial proof-of-concept directional microwave ablation (MWA) applicator. MWA procedures offer cost-effective, minimally-invasive treatment options for localized tumors and other disease. These treatments are especially important to the large population of cancer patients who are poor candidates for surgery or other physically demanding therapies. However, currently available MWA systems employ applicators with omni-directional radiation patterns, which if not placed precisely may damage critical healthy tissues or result in disease recurrence. A directional MWA applicator can facilitate technical and procedural simplifications which to alleviate these current challenges. We will investigate: (1) alternative materials to shrink antenna cross-section and (2) novel antenna geometries to maximize the size of directional microwave ablation zones. We will employ an approach integrating multiphysics computational models, benchtop experimentation in ex vivo tissue, and experiments in animal models in vivo to design, optimize, and validate our device. Our anticipated technical results are the development of a MWA applicator that provides directional control of radiation pattern that can ablate to depths of greater than 30 mm, creating an ablation volume comparable to current clinical non-directional devices.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is an inexpensive handheld smartphone device for rapid detection of the toxigenic cholera pathogen in environmental water sources. Contaminated water sources place populations at risk for contracting cholera. Once contracting the disease, patients with cholera exhibit symptoms of diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration and, if left untreated, ultimately death. Wide-scale cholera outbreaks devastated Haiti in 2010 and Yemen in 2017, affecting over one million total individuals. Currently, methods used to detect the cholera pathogen in water involves a 3 to 5-day water collection and cell culture procedure. This project proposes a portable smartphone platform used to detect the cholera pathogen, Vibrio cholerae, in under 30 minutes at the water source. Smartphone connectivity, will also enable geomapped and time-stamped detection results. This novel and proactive approach for detection can enable organizations to remediate water sources prior to communities contracting and spreading cholera. Downstream, this technology will save the time and costs currently associated with cholera outbreaks and can be expanded to other infectious diseases.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a rapid, cost-effective, and robust smartphone platform to detect Vibrio cholerae and automate the detection result at an environmental water source. The device performs isothermal DNA amplification assay combined with the novel sensing approach, particle diffusometry. This project proposes to characterize the specificity, sensitivity, and lower limit of detection of Vibrio cholerae detection on the smartphone platform. The detection results will be compared against current gold-standard quantitative DNA amplification methods. Further, a reagent storage method involving freeze drying will be used to eliminate the need for cold-chain storage. We will assess the long-term stability of our assay reagents through accelerated aging studies. Lastly, a low powered integrated heating unit will be designed to perform the isothermal DNA amplification assays in the handheld device. At the completion of this Phase I project, an integrated smartphone platform will be ready for field testing.

    This SBIR Phase I project focuses on development of a prototype for a Virtual Music Helper (VMH) for children. Research confirms that music and music learning enhances intelligence, learning and IQ specially in kids. Even children with attention deficit/ hyperactivity disorder benefit from listening to music beforehand in mathematics tests. Children who learn or practice music have shown better results in STEM subjects. However, studies also suggest children opt out of music class based on false belief that they lack musical ability and many kids often find the music practice non-engaging, and boring eventually losing interest and quitting. Parents find it challenging to entice the kids to sit down and practice or they cannot help their kids because either they don?t have time or are not music savvy themselves to help them. The virtual music helper can read the kids? music homework, guide them through the exercise and provide immediate correction. This helper is not to replace teachers, but help the parents at home and encourage kids to practice more. In broader terms this project may spur significant research in finding effective methods for tutoring kids in subjects other than music such as math or language, or for kids with special needs.


    This SBIR Phase I project proposes a Virtual Music Helper (VMH) that is empowered by Artificial Intelligence and Augmented Reality for kids. VMH is a 3D mobile-virtual-human (avatar) that can be personalized for each kid and conduct live dialog with kids both from visual and behavioral perspectives. VHM offers smart content for teachers about each student's progress and weak points. The technical challenges this project will address is the detection and correction of mistakes kids make including polyphonic pitch detection from acoustic instrument, conversion of note sheets to machine readable music format with high accuracy and speed, empowering the avatar with decision making algorithms to provide proper correction and feedback verbally and visually. This platform is also intended to support multiple popular instruments and multiple languages.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to allow new hardware platforms to be
    more quickly deployed and useful software products to be more readily made available
    on a wide variety of hardware to satisfy the needs of their users.  Additionally,
    researchers in science and engineering can reduce the runtime of their applications
    by hours or days on the machines inside high performance computing or data centers,
    enabling more scientific modeling and simulations to be completed within these
    centers, while allowing each individual scientist to concentrate more on his/her
    research, which in turn may more quickly benefit society.  For example, in the
    defense industry, many contracting companies develop Monte Carlo simulation software
    to predict outcomes from disasters. Increasing the throughput of these simulations
    would allow for more simulation results to be analyzed and tested, thereby resulting
    in better predictions and handling of disastrous situations. \n\nThis Small Business
    Innovation Research Phase I project is unique in its automated connection between
    existing performance modeling and prediction tools, and pattern-driven compiler
    optimization. Novel runtime monitoring and modeling techniques will be developed
    to automatically map performance bottlenecks discovered by existing performance
    analysis tools to potential opportunities of source code optimizations. Such opportunities
    again will be used to guide pattern-driven compiler optimizations, particularly
    to enhance the performance of finite element methods on both GPGPUs and multi-core/many-core
    CPUs. Deep learning neural networks will be used to automate the runtime behavior
    classification of computations. The new pattern-driven specialization of compiler
    optimizations will enable general-purpose compiler techniques to be aware of the
    higher-level semantics of library abstractions (e.g., data structures and algorithm
    abstractions) and allow them to be collectively customized and coordinated to
    attain the best performance.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to use controversy detection to support financial institutions' ability to reduce their risks and increase profits. This is part of a growing trend towards "alternative data" products relying on artificial intelligence and machine learning. Besides the financial industry, there are numerous potential applications of controversy detection technology in a variety of market verticals, such as crisis management, defense applications, and advertising technology. Beyond commercial applications, there is scope for social impact by opening analysis and explanatory power of controversies to individual users. Controversies have a massive impact on civic society and the so-called "filter bubble" exacerbates polarization, both political and otherwise; fake news on both sides of the political spectrum has recently captured public attention and generated political concern. Positive impact on society from commercializing this technology includes helping users become better informed and more capable of critically evaluating the often-overwhelming stream of online content. Proving the feasibility of this innovation in a highly quantifiable space such as finance could answer a customer need in that space and create new jobs for the economy, while enabling social good applications that can improve civic society.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project relies on sophisticated machine learning and information retrieval techniques to automatically detect controversial topics. The initial data were collected at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, using NSF-supported research, which recognized controversy by mapping the text of a webpage to algorithmically-identified controversial topics. Research has demonstrated that controversy cannot be detected using existing methods of sentiment analysis, a widely-adopted natural language processing method. This project bridges the gap between the current capabilities of this nascent technology and the clear user need in the financial domain. It will evaluate the feasibility of controversy detection by applying a real-time controversy detection signal to financial data to reduce risk and increase returns.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to enable smaller businesses to participate to the chatbot revolution, by making it easier to design and deploy chatbots. The initial focus of this project is healthcare, where there is great opportunity to improve the quality and availability of patient services. The key technological innovation is the facilitation of an ecosystem of chatbot designers and agents, through the creation of novel chatbot design, collaboration and deployment tools.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will create the technology to allow chatbot designers to incorporate human agents into the logical flow of chatbots. Currently, chatbots are designed in an ad-hoc trial-and-error manner, which is infeasible for small businesses who do not have the resources to constantly refine and evaluate their chatbots. The project will also create techniques to allow human agents to be productive when taking over chatbot sessions, and allow designers to improve the logical flow of chatbots based on usage data.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is that it will save billions of dollars by anticipating construction delays and streamlining coordination to prevent them. Lower costs will help upgrade our nation's infrastructure, which is a critical national priority. Many construction companies strongly want a solution to indoor progress monitoring. Laser scanning is too expensive and slow, and photography services can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars for large projects and introduce logistical challenges. The proposed research would simplify the workflow for progress monitoring of interiors by automatically registering 360 degree photos and video and aligning them to building information models (BIM), providing a cheap, quick, and effective solution for daily progress monitoring.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to localize images, reconstruct 3D models, align them to floorplans or 3D BIM, and use the aligned models to provide actionable data to construction managers. A main challenge is to robustly solve for camera pose using structure-from-motion in indoor scenes that are unfinished and contain textureless and reflective surfaces. A second challenge is to automatically or semi-automatically register the models to 2D or 3D plans, made more difficult by the fact that the site is incomplete and constantly changing. A third challenge is to create interfaces that project personnel can use to perform visual inspection, progress monitoring, requests for information, and other supervision and coordination tasks. The project will investigate the use of tags (i.e., markers) to improve robustness of 3D reconstruction and to perform registration without requiring the 3D positions of tags to be known in advance. Thus, the project addresses major unsolved problems in computer vision, robotics, and their application to construction management.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to accelerate the most common computations in processing Big Data and performing real-time analyses on data streaming-in to enterprise data centers. For the same total cost, the technology advanced by the proposed project is expected to increase performance by a factor of 12. As part of this improvement, it is expected to reduce the energy per instruction by a factor of 25 times or greater. This frees businesses to apply more advanced analytics techniques and react more quickly to changing business conditions.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the ever-growing need to process more data, but on a fixed budget. The objective is to provide accelerator technology for an increasingly critical set of applications that are currently underserved by generic CPU technology. The project aims eventually to deliver a PCIe accelerator card populated by silicon chips based on a new type of accelerator micro-architecture.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable more efficient access to information, goods, and services from organizations and businesses through conversational interfaces. With an estimated 33 million voice-activated devices installed in the U.S. by the end of 2017, consumers are beginning to see the benefits of the rise in business services on these devices. Interacting with computers in natural language is more efficient than ever before, and business are urgently seeking to include their services on this new modality. Yet, while advances in machine learning have increased the speed and accuracy with which conversational interfaces are built, today's solutions still result in major bottlenecks in the development process. Addressing these bottlenecks would result in significant savings of time and resources for businesses, in addition to increased convenience for end users.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project advances the development of machine learning and natural language processing technologies that will enable rapid creation of conversational interfaces and increase the efficiency with which individuals interact with computers. Despite major recent advances in conversational interface tooling, current bottlenecks in building robust conversational interfaces still exist, as portions of the development process go from highly-automated to manually-programmed. Instead, the proposed approach will achieve end-to-end automation using an innovative LSTM sequence-to-sequence machine learning model to learn and simulate human behavior on a web page, as well as a new system for open-domain question answering.

    This SBIR Phase I project will create a novel educational product by pairing VR/360 video with impact measurement software and interactive social engagement tools to simulate true-to-life experiences that enable users to gain personal insight into pressing social issues and then take action to solve them. Installed either as a multisensory 'empathy exhibition' or used in a classroom setting, participants embark on a transformative learning journey which builds empathy and critical understanding about a social issue and those affected by it, then connects them to concrete opportunities to make social change. Users begin as uniformed participants, and through the proposed process emerge as changemakers engaged in solving social problems. Experiential learning has long been an empathy building discipline outside the mediated experience, yet it is encumbered by barriers of cost, safety, distance, time and access that limit participation. Transformation360 will use technology to render experiential learning programs virtually anywhere. The result will be a revolutionary new way to move the public from apathy to action on a limitless number of social issues. Transformation360 will provide nonprofits, governments, and institutions working to solve social problems with a powerful social engagement tool that creates actively engaged citizens, consumers, volunteers, supporters, and social entrepreneurs to address the world's most pressing social problems.


    This SBIR Phase I project will develop a VR/360 video hybridization that will allow users interactive choices within a conventional three-degree-of-freedom 360 Video experience. Currently only VR's computer-generated imaging can provide a significant choice landscape for users. By using 360/3D photography, unique game engine software and multi-scenario video capture in the field the project will give users a new level of choice options for a photo documentary experiences. The efficacy of this technology for building empathy will be quantified through audience testing. Also, cinematic techniques such as mise-en-cine and montage, not currently used in most 360 video projects, will also be tested against audience reactions. These video production and consumption technologies and techniques will also be cross-tested against experience learning processes such as the breaking down assumptions, peer learning, debriefing, uncertainty, and risk. Potential adverse side effects to VR/360 video will also be addressed. The project will rely heavily on the engagement measurement and data visualization tool Harvis to test and analyze audience reactions to these experiments.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project can be summarized as follows. (1) Businesses will benefit from the proposed product because companies are increasingly using data-driven predictive models to improve their bottom line. In many areas where structured data are readily available, such as credit scoring, these models have produced impressive returns on investment. One of the main obstacles hindering the application of these models in other areas is the lack of structured data. By extracting information from sources such as web pages, blogs and social media messages, and storing it as structured data, companies will be able to take advantage of the vast amount of unstructured data that are generated daily and thereby improve their bottom line. (2) As the Chinese economy expands and becomes more deeply intertwined with the US economy, many US businesses will need high-quality and timely information about Chinese markets. However, information extraction from Chinese text is an underserved area. The proposed product can fill this void and thereby meet a significant commercial demand.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a new information extraction (IE) method. Currently IE focuses on information extraction from short text snippets consisting of a few words in order to derive structured factual information from unstructured text. But its performance is often deteriorated by the shortage of features - the sparse feature problem. A major benefit of the approach developed in this project is that it takes advantage of the important role of specific linguistic units even when the number of words in a sentence is limited. These linguistic units give a sentence its structure. Depending on structural characteristics or functional principles of sentences, the features around them are grouped. The grouped features satisfy certain properties and can be used to capture structural and semantic information, which is helpful for minimizing the sparse feature problem.

    and stainless steel hybrid structure. The use of an innovative polymer-to-metal
    connection allows for the creation of a bicycle spoke that out-performs modern
    stainless steel spokes. In comparison, steel spokes are heavier, do not effectively
    damp road vibrations, and are more prone to fatigue related failure. The target
    market for this innovation is the high-end bicycle spoke market, which is valued
    at over $100M. The research of new polymeric materials at universities is at an
    all-time high. Despite this, there exists a gap in the commercialization of new
    materials because of the difficulty in interfacing these materials to other common
    construction materials, such as stainless steel. This work will contribute fundamental
    knowledge to and catalyze the development of processes for new advanced polymer
    products. It will enable the use of UHMWPE and other materials in new applications.
    \n\nThe intellectual merit of this project is the development of an advanced manufacturing
    process capable of the complex manipulation necessary for the production of novel
    polymer-to-metal connections and integral eye splices. These types of connections
    are not practiced in high-volume textile manufacturing today due to the novelty
    of the polymer-to-metal connection and the complexity of the eye splice operation.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is that it will enable small and mid-size robotics and industrial vehicle manufacturers to rapidly deploy computer vision and machine learning in their products and make their machines competitive in the global market place. The project will create a multi-vendor real-time vision stack for industrial machines that enables multiple types of machines to be developed using a uniform software interface. Combined with an app store model, such interfaces will enable a developer community to create application-specific solutions with ease, add features to machines via software and essentially create a new market. When deployed by equipment manufacturers, it will have societal impact by reducing the number of forklift and other industrial and construction machine related accidents, deaths and property damage. There are secondary benefits such as reducing the amount spent on worker compensation. The scientific impact will be the enhanced understanding of principled approaches to stereoscopic depth estimation combined with machine learning based object detectors to create integrated vision systems that function in real-time on commodity hardware.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the fact that current solutions for autonomous vehicles and machines use expensive LIDARs and RADARs in conjunction with cameras. Such systems are cost-prohibitive and ill-suited for industrial applications that operate in structured warehouse and manufacturing environments rather than highways. Manufacturers can benefit from a cheaper integrated vision-based system where all the necessary algorithms, software and hardware engineering has already been done for them. The intellectual merit of the project lies in achieving the following research goals. 1) Develop an algorithmic approach to stereoscopic depth estimation that combines quick-to-generate classic features (e.g., edges and corners) with machine learning. 2) Combine machine learning based object detectors with stereoscopic depth to create an integrated vision pipeline that functions in real-time on commodity hardware. 3) Devise methods to train the system more easily by relying on depth and motion features. 4) Address critical operational design considerations such as thermal and power management and understand requirements to maintain mechanical and structural integrity through periods of intense use.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project focused on a novel seat design that reduces vehicle-based whole-body vibration and shock will 1) better protect human health while 2) addressing major transportation markets including trucking, agriculture, construction, military vehicles, and mass transit, as well as automobiles and water-/land-based recreational vehicles.  The envisioned socio-economic impact is significant:  Continual exposure to whole-body vibration and shocks can cause discomfort, reduction in work performance, and chronic low-back pain for vehicle operators and passengers.  Low-back pain is the largest component of disability among all occupational-related injuries. Though so-called "active" seats can help reduce these vibrations/shocks, their high cost is a major barrier. The low-cost seats being pursued here could benefit millions of vehicle operators. The work will also result in a greater scientific and technological understanding of the sources/effects of and potential remedies for whole-body vibration and shock. The suspension system market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 5.11%, by value, from 2016 to 2021. The market is expected to grow from USD 52.38 Billion in 2015 to USD 67.22 Billion by 2021.  The market for bus seats alone is expected to be at $10.03 Billion by the year 2022.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is focused on the feasibility of a quasi-semi-active seat (QSAS) technology.  Seating design for heavy equipment and vehicle operators has faced a trade-off between performance and cost. The most-complex 'active seats' reduce vibration but are cost-prohibitive at $3,500. Semi-active seats are simplified active seats and perform better than passive seats, but still magnify input vibration and cost several thousand dollars. Passive seats are the least expensive, but they magnify input vibration at low frequencies.  Recent design/material advances and strong preliminary data set the stage for developing an innovative passive seat at a fraction of the cost of semi-active seats that will reduce input vibration at low frequencies. Phase I feasibility will be shown using sliding friction to mitigate vibration at low frequency.  A QSAS prototype will be built and used to show potential in laboratory and field settings.  Technical challenges will involve material selection that will show maximum vibration mitigation and dissipation, as well as integration of the cushion with a suspension system that can handle the weight of a seated person. The research will determine effective performance parameters under different magnitudes and frequencies of vibration that simulate realistic operational conditions.

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is reduced levelized cost of electricity (LCOE)
    of offshore wind from current levels that are about twice that of onshore wind.
    Given the proximity of offshore wind resources to load centers along the coast,
    it is an attractive renewable energy source for the nation, but high costs are
    an impediment to widespread adoption. One way to address this is with larger turbines
    that can lead to lower ?balance of plant? costs, which can be as high as 65% of
    the total project costs of offshore wind. However, turbine rating is currently
    limited due to the large size and weight of the generator and the rotor, as well
    as infrastructure obstacles like manufacturing, transport, and assembly. The lightweight
    superconducting (SC) generators being developed within this project, coupled with
    advanced rotors already being developed by the OEM?s, could open the door to significantly
    larger turbine ratings and lower costs. The underlying high specific power machine
    technology can also help transform a number of other weight-sensitive electrical
    systems like hybrid electric airplanes and ship propulsion.\n \nThis Small Business
    Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to disrupt the traditional risk
    versus benefit trade of the low Technology Readiness Level (TRL) SC technology
    by significantly increasing the benefits with a novel ?active magnetic shielding?
    concept. This design concept enables a very high operating magnetic field within
    the machine while eliminating the need for a yoke made of ferromagnetic steel
    to contain the field. The higher internal fields increase the electromagnetic
    torque significantly over other solutions, leading to very high power density.
    Additionally, the elimination of heavy iron from the magnetic circuit leads to
    further reduction in weight. The proposed generator design can be about half the
    size of currently available wind direct-drives. Efficiency is also expected to

    the same current density. Available cryogenic cooling technology from the commercially
    successful magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) industry will be adapted and utilized
    in the machine to reduce many of the cryogenics related risks while maintaining
    high specific power.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been

- abstractText: "The broader impact / commercial potential of this project would be
    in the ability to deploy drones in industrial and commercial indoor environments
    as aerial robots.  A key requirement to deploying drones in such indoor environments
    in the presence of people is to make them safe and non-threatening.  In addition,
    for drones to function as robots, they need to be made fully autonomous and minimize
    the need for human operation or intervention.  These attributes are not possible
    with conventional drone technology today.  The ability to use drones as aerial
    robots can open up opportunities in large markets such as warehouse inventory
    scanning, construction, security, and factory automation.  Such robots can enable
    functions such as scanning and reconstruction of the environment, or also ?pick
    and place? at high throughput within factories.  The use of drones in industrial
    indoor environments for these applications can also result in broader societal
    benefits, including improved worker safety inside industrial indoor environments
    (by performing tasks that may otherwise require harnesses, forklifts or ladders);
    reduced environmental impacts (in construction sites by catching discrepancies
    early and minimizing rework and material wastage) and macroeconomic benefits (enabling
    automated factories of the future and bringing back US jobs).  \n\nThis Small
    Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project has the potential to advance
    the frontiers of knowledge in design and control systems for use in drones and
    other applications.  This unique approach redefines the control systems for rotorcraft,
    and enables a drone with dramatically improved metrics ? as much as 10X -- that
    are traditionally used to characterize the performance of drones.  In this Phase
    I project, Vimaan plans to complete the design and modeling of the system, develop
    the control mechanisms for the system, and integrate, test and demonstrate the
    application of the innovation to a drone that has the above attributes.  During
    the project, Vimaan will need to overcome some critical technical challenges in
    the components and systems design, the control circuitry and controls algorithms
    and the power budgets, timings and optimizations of the sub-systems for the required
    performance.  If successful, such an innovation would revolutionize decades old
    legacy technologies that have been hitherto deployed in rotorcraft, and make possible
    attributes that have been long sought after by the aerospace industry.\n\nThis

    This SBIR Phase I project will address the pedagogical and evaluative problems caused by our current inability to measure core outcomes beyond information recall. The proposed innovation makes important educational outcomes such as deep understanding, cognition (thinking skills) and awareness of thinking (metacognition) measurable. Reliable assessment of these outcomes has broad significance to education and society writ large, as many employers struggle with skills gaps between high school and college graduates and the professional, personal and societal demands on adults in the 21st Century. This research combines cognitive science, epistemology, systems science, and complex systems with new developments in artificial intelligence, including machine learning and neural networks, and aligns well with the NSF's mission to promote progress in science and advance national prosperity. This project not only has the potential to impact core tenets of educational practice - including how teachers teach, how learners learn, and how we measure and understanding knowledge - but also may have impact on science through increased ability to map and analyze patterns and common structures in knowledge and generally for Americans to increase their developmental skills and abilities. Beginning in an educational market valued at $8-15 billion, this project has the potential to catalyze significant job creation and have significant commercial impact across a range of related industries.

    This SBIR Phase I project introduces a visual grammar for mapping ideas in a canvas-based environment, and provides a neural-network based mechanism for quantitatively comparing expressions of complex ideas along many dimensions to facilitate a new approach to thinking, learning, and assessment. Maps of ideas will be tokenized and serialized and then fed through a recurrent neural network model to produce encoded numeric vector representations that are meaningfully comparable in their encoded form. Once in this form, vectors will be compared and evaluated for content and structure similarity, and insights offered in many dimensions: depth of detail, understanding of relationships, and numerous other meaningful measures. These vectors enable scalable, consistent, constructive assessment in a way not previously possible. In the mapping environment, teachers and students will create maps either on their own, or collaboratively together in real-time. As users create maps, we use the generated vectors to analyze both content and structure, and then prompt users to think about their subject matter from new perspectives. As a means of evaluation, teachers will create mapping activities for students to complete, and then student maps will be quantitatively compared to the standards and target maps which represent the complete understanding of the topic.

    This SBIR Phase I project introduces a new design for antibody-based therapeutic molecules. The generally rigid arms in Y-shaped conventional antibodies are replaced with flexible and extendible linkers attached to binding domains that are smaller than those found in conventional antibodies. This new design allows multiple therapeutic targets to be bound at once, with greater binding strength and fewer off-target effects than was previously possible. This project will remake two of the most successful cancer drugs of the last decade, creating improved versions of each. In addition, a new molecule combining the functionality of both will be produced. If this project is successful, it may improve the treatments available for many kinds of advanced metastatic cancer, especially melanoma and lung cancer. Though the current focus is on cancer, the method described here may improve or combine the performance of many therapeutic antibodies; this project is just the first demonstration. The potential long-term impact of this SBIR Phase I project may extend throughout the pharmaceutical industry, representing a significant commercial opportunity and a milestone of applied biological research.

    This project introduces a novel drug design that improves on monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). It uses a chemical assembly method that joins immunoglobulin Fc domains to small, single-chain fibronectin binding domains through flexible, extendible, non-peptidyl linkers. The resulting flexible drug molecules benefit from two-handed cooperative binding, in which both domains are able to bind a disease target or targets simultaneously. They thus achieve higher binding affinity and target selectivity than mAbs, while also being smaller and easier to manufacture. These molecules can also be mono- or bispecific as needed. This project will produce flexible monospecific and bispecific molecules against the targets of the two most successful checkpoint inhibitors in current cancer immunotherapy. This project encompasses chemical synthesis, verification of binding stoichiometry, in vitro measurements of binding affinity to both purified protein and target cells, and cellular assays of both checkpoint inhibition and bispecific binding. It sets the stage for pre-clinical animal studies of these cancer drugs, and showcases a molecular design that could be used to improve most antibody therapies in the broader pharmaceutical market.

    This SBIR Phase I project aims to develop and demonstrate the feasibility of a system that can identify a broad range of bacteria in < 1 hour directly from blood. Existing diagnostic systems require 2-6 days to identify the bacteria, which delays treatment using appropriate antibiotics. Sepsis, which is often caused by a bacterial infection, contributes to up to half of all hospital deaths in the US largely due to complications arising from delays or inappropriate treatment (which is mainly because of lack of information regarding the infection-causing bacteria). It is the most expensive hospital-treated condition in the United States ? representing $20.3 billion in healthcare costs. The proposed system aims to sharply reduce the time to provide information needed by physicians, enabling them to initiate treatment using the appropriate antibiotic rapidly. This is expected to lead to significant reductions in costs, complications, and mortality. Further, by eliminating the need for culturing, new insights into bacterial behavior can be acquired contributing to additional fundamental knowledge of bacteria. This knowledge will aid antibiotic discovery efforts, improve understanding of mechanisms of drug resistance, support new biomanufacturing processes through faster detection of bacterial contamination of pharmaceutical products and foods, and characterization of the microbiome.

    The challenges of rapid bacterial identification are primarily in two areas ? sample preparation, that eliminates the need for culturing, and multiplex identification, to cover the diverse range of bacterial species capable of causing infection. The proposed work is based on leveraging the differential response between bacteria and the cells in a sample matrix to selectively break down the sample matrix, but not bacteria, such that the largest lysis debris is smaller than intact bacteria. The debris is subsequently separated from intact bacteria using a size-based technique enabling rapid isolation of a broad range of bacteria directly from the sample. A novel Fourier-transform infrared microspectroscopy system is then used to identify the isolated bacteria at clinically relevant concentrations. No bacteria-specific reagents are employed. The proposed Phase I work addresses the highest risk technical hurdles in the process. Isolating and detecting low concentration of bacteria directly from blood is accomplished through the three objectives of this project that optimize the purification and bacterial recovery from the sample, identification accuracy, and performance of the integrated system relative to the traditional culturing-based method.

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase I project develops a bacterial platform for intracellular
    drug delivery to solid tumors, with a primary focus on liver cancer. Every year,
    30,000 men and women are diagnosed with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma
    (HCC), which has a 5-year survival rate of 17.6 %. The prognosis for these patients
    is poor. Currently, there are no curative treatments for these patients. The current
    standard-of-care only increases overall survival by months and has toxic side
    effects, with a cost to the US healthcare system of $1.5B per year. This technology
    is based on the inherent feature of bacteria to colonize solid tumors throughout
    the body in ratios of 100,000 to 1 compared to healthy tissue. Due to this specificity,
    the developed bacterial platform has the potential to increase dosage specifically
    in tumors, while reducing toxic side effects in healthy tissues. This platform
    will be a toolbox that can target intracellular pathways that are currently considered
    undruggable and deliver potent doses of biologicals directly into tumor cells.
    The affinity of bacteria for solid tumors, independent of organ localization,
    enables the extension of this delivery method to other hard-to-treat tumor types,
    such as pancreas, ovarian and gastric cancer. \n\nSystemic cancer therapies have
    many obstacles, such as stability in the blood, traversing the cellular membrane,
    internalization and endosomal release. These processes impede the use of RNAi
    and peptides in humans and hamper the targeting of intracellular pathways with
    monoclonal antibodies. The development of a bacterial drug delivery platform can
    optimize drug potency in tumors and reduce side effects in healthy tissue. In
    this SBIR phase I, efficacy of this platform will be measured in HCC by targeting
    intracellular pathways essential for cell survival, for which no systemic therapy
    exists. A bacterial strain will be created according to FDA guidelines that can
    be manufactured reliably without loss of activity. An optimized preservation protocol
    will be developed to ensure maximal bacterial fitness and maximal delivery efficacy
    after administration. This bacterial delivery system has the potential to accelerate
    the translation of fundamental cancer research into clinical therapies. Discoveries
    could be genetically translated directly into protein, antibody or shRNA therapies
    that regulate mammalian gene expression and function.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's

    of an in-situ elongation process of an immobilized label-free single strand DNA
    probe by means of sensitive electrochemical events occurring at the conductive
    gold microchip surface. For the development of this new sensing microchip device
    the team will use commercially available products. Silicon wafers have been used
    as substrate with gold as electrodes due to their reliability but these materials
    are expensive and the fabrication is labor intensive. Therefore, important diagnostic
    device parameters will be studied after incorporation of bare bio-sensing strips.
    Phase I of this project, is aimed at demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed

    and gas output. The goal of this project is to develop a software package for
    automated pattern recognition that can be used by seismic processing companies
    to automatically pick geological features from seismic data. Seismic data volumes
    have grown exponentially over the last three decades as the seismic exploration
    industry increases its survey coverage. Manual picking and geological pattern
    identification jobs, which depend on visual inspection, are labor intensive and
    cannot keep up with the growth in data generated by seismic surveys. In this project,

    trained by a deep learning network. Lessons learned in training an efficient deep
    learning network for pattern recognition have wide applications in other areas
    such as medical image analysis. This project will support the training of both
    graduate and undergraduate students in the areas of seismic exploration, machine
    learning and high-performance computing. \n\nThis Small Business Technology Transfer

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the restoration of trust in computing systems.  Successful cyberattacks, including mass privacy breaches and the discovery of device backdoors, have shaken trust in computing, put users at risk, hurt the economy, and even threatened our national security.  The usual set of ad-hoc, incomplete, and costly approaches simply have not addressed the problem.  This research effort will advance a viable, practical, and holistic solution that gives users much stronger guarantees of security while lowering the costs of keeping systems secure.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop TigerGuard, a computer system security architecture that contains the effects of cyberattacks on existing computer infrastructure.  TrustGuard is based on a small, separately manufactured, and easy-to-verify hardware element, called the Sentry, that serves as the root of trust.  The Sentry is a general-purpose hardware trust component that, when combined with an application-specific Dynamic Specification Check (DSC) software component, provides flexible containment capabilities.  The containment guarantees of TigerGuard hold despite design and manufacturing flaws (known and not-yet-known, malicious and unintentional) in the operating system, firmware, hardware, and software, including those in the application software itself. Formal verification of both the Sentry and DSC, a practical effort given their total size of only a few thousand lines of code, becomes equivalent in security guarantees to proving hundreds of millions of existing lines of code correct (including the processor design, memory implementation, hard drive firmware, the operating system, shared libraries, and the application code).

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to provide spoof-free biometric fingerprint sensors. Consumer confidence in adopting many technologies such as IoT devices, and reach a cash-less society is limited by our confidence in transactions being fraud-free. Around the world, there are varying degrees of fraud and it is well known that poorer countries have higher levels of fraud then more advanced countries. By providing a trustable biometric device, the proposed commercialization plan will allow lower levels of fraud and allow greater degree of economic activity bringing up standards of living. The technology of GHz ultrasonics for sensing also has the potential for to be used for applications in being able to image baby fingerprints, enable fingerprint readers in fire-arms for authenticated use at very fast speeds, and allow integration with credit and debit cards. The success of the commercial activities will create a new paradigm for trusting the electronic economy.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop revolutionary new biometric sensors. Biometric technologies range from sensing the unique patterns of the eyes, to voice, and fingerprints amongst other markers. Capacitive fingerprint sensors, and optical fingerprint sensors are very commonly found in smartphones and desktop applications. These technologies produce images that are often limited in resolution and are not spoof-proof. For example, optical fingerprint readers can be spoofed by fingerprint images and capacitive fingerprint sensors can be spoofed by skin-like dielectric polymer fingerprint molds. Ultrasonic images offer the potential for detecting tissue material properties that can help identify fake fingerprints. Although many low-frequency technologies for ultrasonic fingerprint sensing are available, very few have made it into the market in large quantities owing to cost, packaging, and insufficient SNR and resolution. In this project the company will extend the frequency of operation to the GHz range to achieve four to eight times the standard industry standard of 500 dpi resolution. Coupled with integrated circuits operating at low voltages, the company aims for integration of the sensors in very thin platforms such as credit cards.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop and bring to market tools that improve code quality and help avoid dangerous bugs, while also improving programmer productivity. Poor code quality leads to bugs which often translate into financial loses and can even endanger human life. A study by NIST estimated software bugs cost $59 billion annually. The key aspect of this project is a programmer-friendly language for describing software fixes. Successful adoption of the language by the programmer community can have a far-reaching positive impact upon the software community: programmers will have a common, formal, language to discuss ways to fix bugs, and the result of their collaboration could be used to automatically fix software systems.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will address the research and technical challenges in providing programmers with a language to express their knowledge of error patterns and their fixes, and a tool that uses this information to check and fix software systems. The research objective is to refine the language such that it is easy to use by programmers, and to provide a scalable infrastructure. This will be achieved by iteratively improving both the language and the supporting infrastructure with feedback from early users. The anticipated result is that the technology will be applicable to a wide variety of bugs and to large code bases.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to enhance the capabilities of a research
    tool for companies, legal experts and researchers undertaking nationwide comparative
    policy analysis in the public health domain. The tool will assist experts in identifying
    relevant policy documents by determining and scoring the significance of statutory
    provisions in context of specific legal questions. The quantitative approach can
    enable novel policy tracking. Rather than experts setting up alerts for updates
    to a specific set of documents, this tool learns from the legal text used to answer
    legal questions to allow for real time tracking and discovery of updates and other
    relevant documents. This approach to policy tracking can present experts with
    timely information on updates, along with revealing new documents as they are
    introduced.  Timely analysis can inform policy-makers, facilitating the crafting
    of optimized evidence-based public health legislation.  Reducing the cost and
    effort of the most time-consuming aspects of legal research can make precise scientific
    policy analysis affordable and accessible commercially and in real time. \n\nThis
    Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will decrease the time
    required to produce timely analysis of public health policy across 50 states.
    This research will apply machine learning, natural language processing and graph
    theory techniques to extract logical legal ontologies by computing similarities
    of public health provisions in statutory text. In domain specific problems, large
    sets of examples of annotated text are required. In the legal domain there is
    little available expert-labeled legal corpora and purposefully curating this kind
    of dataset is prohibitively expensive.  To address this challenge, the proposed
    solution integrates transparently into legal experts' workflow while generating
    ontology that mirrors the approach of a domain expert. The second challenge is
    that searching for patterns in the relations of a very large network of documents
    can be very expensive computationally. The proposed solution addresses this by
    extracting clues from the expert workflow to identify shortcuts that simplify
    and constrain the larger problem. These clues, combined with sparse expert labeled
    data can produce a more accurate baseline for optimization of scoring and similarity
    comparison of larger sets. By being integrated into more workflows, the transparent
    annotation process and algorithm could be applied to other policy domains."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to spark more cybersecurity innovations, by reducing the R&D expenditures via providing fundamental security analytics tools as a service. Global cybersecurity spending is increasing significantly year over year. Enormous R&D resources have been invested in the development of a range of security products to meet this market. However, different security product providers repeatedly build the fundamental security analytics tools and use them to further develop different innovative security solutions. That is a huge waste of R&D resources.  The proposed solution reduces the R&D expenditure of customers and lowers the entry bar for the growing cybersecurity market. With the lowered entry bar, the company anticipates that more innovations will be put into practice. As a result, with the increased competition and reduced R&D expenditure, the company expects a reduction in cybersecurity spending by companies and the government.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on malware intelligence, which has been a long-standing as well as increasingly complex cybersecurity problem. Traditional signature based detection and manual reverse engineering approaches can no longer keep up with the pace of increasingly sophisticated obfuscation and attack techniques. The objective of this project is to develop a security analysis tool for malware intelligence by combining the following two unique techniques: "whole-system emulation based dynamic binary analysis" and "deep-learning based binary code similarity detection". The first technique provides a fine-grained monitor capability to observe the behaviors of malware. The second technique provides the capability of learning and characterizing complex features. By combining these two techniques, the proposed technology will be able to better understand malware and generate actionable intelligence.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to dramatically improve the human productivity in gathering insights from data, and to democratize data analytics by making it available to a broad class of users within an enterprise. With DataChat, complex analyses can be carried out by simply conversing with a trained chatbot. The proposed approach has the potential to open a new vertical in the analytics market in which chatbots aid humans in carrying out the task of creating, deploying and running complex data science pipelines. This project could lead to the creation of a sub-market in the existing analytic software market, and it could also help improve the productivity of the (non-technology) sectors of the economy that increasingly require high-quality and fast insights from both their archival and real-time datasets.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will take on a number of technical challenges including designing and developing a method to allow programming the underlying program that powers chatbots. Another technical challenge that will be tackled is making it easy to load external data that may not have well-defined schemas. A type inferencing mechanism, and associated set of methods to learn over historical data, will be developed to address this research aspect. Another technical challenge is building good machine learning models, for which a set of mechanisms is proposed that will allow automatic exploration and ranking of machine learning models, aiding the user in picking the right model for the specific task at hand. Overall these technical components will collectively contribute to the different facets of data analysis that are needed to gather insights from data, and will power the overall chatbot approach.

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project resides in motivating cross-disciplinary innovations
    for more efficient, smarter, and safer technologies.  These benefits will be realized

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I Project will develop a metal-free route to the production of high performance plastics and composites. Specifically, this project focuses on a unique class of materials based upon a thermoset that displays high strength-to-weight ratio and exceptional fracture toughness. A challenge to broader adoption of these materials stems from the current reliance on metal-based reagents and catalysts for their production. The metals impose a significant recurring cost of production, show sensitivity to air, and remain as contaminants in the final products. This innovation provides the first metal-free access to such materials. Additionally, the unique metal-free catalyst system is capable of producing resin and polymer feedstocks that are not available from metal-based reagents, and may offer advantages in processing and performance. The projected commercial impacts of the innovation will be enhanced material performance, lower cost products, and broadened (new) fields of use. The existing market is estimated to be $578M with 4.9% annual growth through 2023.

    The intellectual merit of this project is the invention and development of the first metal-free route to olefin metathesis polymers and oligomers. Prior art has demonstrated on small scale the ability to use a unique organocatalyst to produce polymer and resin feedstocks that are easily processable into high performance thermosets and composites. The organocatalyst approach is a divergence from all previous methods of producing materials via olefin metathesis and therefore warrants validation and optimization toward commercial scale-up. The Phase I research aims will include (1) scale-up through the design and implementation of flow reactor technologies, (2) mechanical analyses and product specification sheets for thermoset prototypes, and (3) evaluation of new resins and polymers for use in fiber reinforced composite materials.  The results should be useful commercially and academically.

    This SBIR Phase I project is focused on modeling, designing, analyzing, building and testing a prototype commercial superinsulation called High Performance Multi-Layer Insulation (HPMLI). HPMLI is based on a new technology that significantly reduces heat leak, and allows a multilayer insulation to be used in commercial applications. HPMLI could provide R-235 thermal insulation, compared to current state of the art R-6 foam insulation, offering 40-fold lower heat leak into fridges and freezers and reducing energy use. Heating and cooling account for 74% of U.S. residential energy use, with water heaters and refrigerators consuming 26% and $60B in annual costs. This superinsulation, originally developed for NASA and used for spaceflight, could save 90% of energy used for refrigeration and heating appliances, reducing energy costs and protecting our environment. This opportunity is to develop and manufacture a novel ultra-high-performance insulation for use by appliance manufacturers and consumers for improved energy efficiency, and will enable the small business to grow to 17 employees, with $20M in revenue by 2022. This insulation has many potential applications, including home refrigerators, commercial freezers, water heaters, refrigerated trucks and shipping containers, industrial hot/cold processes, food coolers and buildings.


    HPMLI is based on novel discrete spacers and radiation barrier layers, forming a new very high- performance insulation. A novel system is proposed in which the spacers self- support the layers against external atmospheric pressure, allowing use in air. Technical challenges must be solved that carefully balance structural support, heat flux, cost and ease of integration into appliances. This insulation is only possible due to the unique properties of the discrete spacers, which must be designed, developed and tested for this application. The goals are to successfully build and test a prototype demonstrating greater than R-200 thermal performance, and able to be vacuum sealed into vacuum panels or appliance case walls. The system will be thermally modeled for several concepts, a spacer design iterated, prototype demonstration units built for a fridge and/or food cooler, and the heat flux through the insulation measured. HPMLI will be compared to current state of the art foam, and factors required for commercialization considered in this Phase I design.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of an intuitive, easy-to-use, Smart Respiratory Health Management System for respiratory patients and their physicians. This system includes (1) lab-quality lung function data produced by the proposed mobile spirometer and paired smartphone application, (2) the interpretation and contextualization of this lung function data based on local environmental and physiological risk factors, and (3) the delivery of these insights to physicians and patients. By leveraging this software platform, this technology is expected to enable physicians to make timely interventions with their at-risk patients, thereby preventing acute respiratory exacerbations (e.g., asthma attacks) and any associated hospitalizations or visits to the emergency department. Currently, respiratory diseases are poorly managed, and the proposed predictive technology can help reduce the 1.6 million annual asthma-related visits to the emergency department. By enabling preventative patient interventions, the proposed technology is expected to reduce the high cost of asthma-related emergency department visits and hospitalizations. The proposed system-level solution will empower asthma patients to participate in their own health and treatment, while simultaneously improving health-related behaviors, patient-physician communication, and preventative care coordination.

    The proposed project focuses on the development of a software platform that connects chronic respiratory disease patients to physicians, to alert physicians of declining lung health. With this preemptive alert, physicians can intervene with patients before an acute respiratory exacerbation, thereby reducing hospitalizations and their associated costs. There are three steps required to implement this proposed system. The first is to facilitate the affordable collection of daily lab-quality lung function data. This step has already been completed via a mobile spirometer and pair smartphone application. The second step is to interpret and contextualize the collected data. This step requires the development of a predictive algorithm that incorporates risk factors from a  physical activity and local environment. The third step is to deliver this data and their interpretation to the physician in a manner that is seamlessly incorporated into the existing electronic health records infrastructure and the physician's workflow. The second and third steps will be undertaken as part of this Phase I grant.

    This STTR Phase I project will remove the most critical roadblock to making long-lasting batteries from safe and economical zinc and air. Zinc is plentiful in the U.S. and zinc-air batteries have the potential to hold more than five times the energy of current lithium-ion batteries, but a key challenge for making rechargeable zinc-air batteries is that the zinc inside the battery naturally forms sharp needles called dendrites during recharging. Over time these dendrites can grow large enough to damage the inner workings of the battery, reducing efficiency and lifetime. This project will borrow principles from an adjacent field, the electroplating industry, to create new organic chemicals that will seek out and stop dendrite growth within the battery during recharging. Chemical additives have a long history in electroplating for controlling the shape of metal surfaces, and the same principles can apply to additives designed here to control zinc growth during battery recharging. This new technology will make zinc-air batteries cheaper and longer-lasting to eventually replace existing battery technologies, enabling longer-distance electric vehicles, reducing equipment weight for soldiers, contributing a valuable technology to the economy, and helping to maintain the role of the U.S. as a leader in energy storage technology.



    This STTR Phase I project will identify the critical chemistry necessary to elegantly and economically suppress zinc dendrite formation, alleviating one of the most significant challenges complicating the full commercial emergence of Zn-Air battery technology. Eschewing the established tactic of applying existing chemicals from the catalog, this project will take inspiration from the PI?s experience designing additives for similar environments in the electroplating industry to introduce novel proprietary organic chemistry addressing the dendrite bottleneck directly. The key technical challenge will be to optimize the molecular features to simultaneously provide efficient dendrite suppression and low voltage loss. A broad series of molecules will be created to combine strong interactions with zinc, modest polarization, low cost and straightforward scalability. Evaluating and iterating upon these candidates in bench-scale electrochemical analyses and performance tests in coin and pouch cell batteries will yield a dendrite-suppressing product to bring significant value to Zn-Air technology and other Zn-based battery markets. At its successful conclusion, this project will not only produce products for these markets, but it will also provide molecular design principles useful for the development of other metal-based battery additives, and promote the merits of novel additive development for the broader battery industry.

    is the most efficient and widespread method to deliver DNA into microorganisms
    for this application. State-of-the-art electroporation involves cuvettes that
    expose the cells and DNA to uniform electric fields. However, this process is
    currently slow, labor-intensive, and expensive. The proposed technology can be
    automated by augmenting existing liquid handling robots, and, when operated in
    parallel, may improve the genetic transformation rate by up to 10,000X compared
    to current methods. This will represent a paradigm shift in areas dependent upon
    genetic transformation where DNA delivery using electroporation is currently a
    major bottleneck. Ultimately, the goal is to address the need for a high-throughput
    genetic transformation platform to accelerate innovation in synthetic biology."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the need for non-invasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and hands-free control of technologies, including artificial and virtual reality (AR/VR) and smart devices. The proposed multi-purposed BCI is expected to have immediate applications for several industries, including manufacturing and medicine. Currently, existing systems are either too expensive or limited for real-time control. The proposed BCI is specifically designed for 3 dimensional environments, and is intended to leverage multiple ('hybrid') signals from the human body to allow increased performance using affordable hardware. It is also designed for and expected to allow AR/VR control, which can enable productivity applications, as well as model BCI use in real-world scenarios. The long term goal is to enable users to scroll menus, select objects, and even type using their brain activity. The platform uses the existing form-factor of AR/VR headsets to incorporate brain-sensing electrodes, and will be compatible with popular devices, independently or in parallel with their existing controllers. The electrodes are designed to be safe, non-invasive, and dry (requiring conductive gel or saline). The high-risk, high-reward research to be conducted under this project will significantly advance the applications of BCI systems in general, with an emphasis on AR/VR technologies.

    The proposed project concerns a novel hybrid BCI by combining oculomotor and electroencephalography (EEG) signals via a custom machine learning platform. BCIs detect and interpret neural signals enabling control over a variety of technologies. However, current BCIs remain extremely limited in their applicability. They either require expensive equipment, invasive surgery, or have too low performance when using affordable noninvasive hardware. This BCI aims to provide real-time control in 3-dimensional scenarios, (e.g., AR/VR/real-world smart devices), while using affordable hardware. This SBIR Phase I project seeks to combine three distinct innovations: high-performance EEG signal analysis, high-speed eye movement classification, and custom multi-signal ensemble classification techniques. Specifically, the project seeks to use a custom machine learning and artificial intelligence approach informed by physiology to combine oculomotor and EEG signals to specifically enable3D AR/VR control. The ultimate goal is to develop a high performance BCI system that affords flexible user control across hardware, software, and mobile applications.

    This SBIR Phase I project aims to develop a novel blood diagnostic to detect unruptured intracranial aneurysms (IA) in asymptomatic patients. About 2-5% of the U.S. population (about 6-17 million Americans) have an unruptured IA, and these individuals are largely asymptomatic and thus unaware of the potential danger they are in. Currently, no good screening tools to identify patients with unruptured IAs exist. As a result, about 30,000 Americans suffer IA rupture each year without warning, 10-15% of whom die on the way to the hospital and another 30-40% of whom die within a month. The diagnostic screening technology developed in this project will identify people who have unruptured IAs, thus enabling patients to be monitored and receive preventative treatment, which can drastically reduce the rate of rupture. In addition to the health benefits of this non-invasive test, it will also result in massive savings for the healthcare system. The estimated lifetime healthcare costs for annual cases of patients with ruptured IA is about $3 billion, and more than $885 million for patients with unruptured IAs. Plus, the annual lost wages of surviving ruptured IA patients and their caretakers combined is an estimated $138 million.

    This project aims to develop a molecular diagnostic to detect biomarkers of unruptured aneurysms using the transcriptomes of circulating neutrophils. Preliminary results have shown that circulating neutrophils isolated from blood samples could be used to predict unruptured IA presence with 80% accuracy. This Phase I project will increase the sample size of the previous discovery and validation cohorts to give more confidence in the discovered biomarkers as well as increase the accuracy of the proposed diagnostic. Transcriptomes of neutrophil RNA from patients with and without aneurysms will be obtained through next-generation sequencing. The transcriptome data will be used to further develop biomarker models by employing a machine learning pipeline that uses supervised learning combined with 10-fold cross-validation to prevent over-fitting. The created biomarker models will be validated using neutrophil RNA expression from an independent cohort of patients. Predictive accuracy of 90% with an AUC greater than 0.80 will be used to measure success. Furthermore, to established feasibility of assessing the biomarkers via an inexpensive test, differential expression of biomarker genes will be tested using RT-qPCR, a cheaper, more facile technique than RNA sequencing.

    This SBIR Phase I project will develop a new approach for Additive Manufacturing (AM) of objects made from ceramics, metals, and polymers. Developed a generation ago, AM had the potential to transform the design and manufacture of products. However, legacy AM approaches have failed primarily because of the high cost of inputs, and because output lacks precision, quality and durability. Our proposed approach has broad industry potential. The broader societal impact is to change the entire competitive stance of US manufacturing by revolutionizing industrial design and enhancing local manufacturing. This project has the potential to advance science and the prosperity of US manufacturing industries. Its commercial impact may span industries from product design to aerospace, space, defense, and human health.

    This SBIR Phase I project will demonstrate the integrated production of objects made from ceramics, metals, and polymers additively at room temperature from stock inputs such as rods and discs. Over 95% of metallic AM output today uses metallic powders as inputs. These inputs are costly, explosive, and harmful to human health if ingested. Furthermore, current AM output suffers from imprecision, poor quality, inconsistency, and lack of durability. Additionally, legacy Metallic AM platforms are large, expensive, operate at high temperatures, and are isolated from the engineers who rely on them. The key objectives of this project are (1) to demonstrate the feasibility of a room-temperature fabrication approach and (2) to achieve several crucial milestones involving the precision of location, thickness, strength, uniformity and reliability of AM output.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will be the development of a fermentation-based technology that enables the renewable and sustainable production of medium-chain fatty acids - an important class of widely used industrial chemicals - using glycerol-rich waste streams as feedstocks. These chemical products constitute a growing multi-billion dollar market with applications in the flavoring, fragrances, personal care, plastics, textile, and pharmaceutical industries. This technology also will create new high-value uses for existing glycerol-rich waste streams generated within the bio-diesel industry, which can greatly improve the economic competitiveness of bio-diesel with fossil diesel, especially in an era of low oil prices. Thus, commercialization of this fermentation-based technology will serve as a foundation for developing additional eco-friendly technologies for the production of other industrial chemicals that contribute to the ~$800 billion/year petrochemical industry, in turn creating new jobs for helping the environment, benefiting society, and building a sustainable future. In addition, this SBIR project will establish a carbon conservation technology as the basis for developing the next-generation of fermentation-based chemical production technologies.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a unique carbon conserving (C2) platform technology to enable the cost-competitive and sustainable production of a variety of fatty chemicals from renewable feedstocks such as crude glycerol. The C2 platform technology comprises a series of non-natural biosynthetic pathways that minimize/eliminate carbon loss as CO2 during production, thereby improving theoretical yields over the state of the art by as much as 50%. The improved achievable yields along with the anaerobic production processes enabled by the C2 technology are two crucial features for establishing bioprocesses with cost-competitive economics relative to incumbent technologies, which is critical for commercial success. One goal of this Phase I project will be to demonstrate the production of a high-value fatty acid, hexanoic acid, from crude glycerol and using the C2 technology. For the second goal, enzyme screening, strain development, and metabolic engineering approaches will be implemented for improving hexanoic acid production metrics (i.e., higher titers, rates, and yields) from crude glycerol. Accomplishing these goals will substantially de-risk the C2 technology and establish its commercial potential for the cost-advantaged production of hexanoic acid at the commercial level.

    in the development of smart, self-healing nanocapsules as anticorrosive pigment
    additive for commercialization of sustainable, economical and metal free acrylic,

    anticorrosive coating will meet and exceed the performance of solvent and heavy
    metals based coatings and disrupt the current technology paradigms by delivering
    a sustainable and efficient anticorrosive coating technology into the market.
    The cost to fix or replace corroded structures in the US alone is a staggering
    $500 Billions/year that is compounded by the toxic environmental impact on account
    of the use of heavy metals such as, chromium, zinc and lead as anticorrosion pigments.
    This project will directly address these two important unmet industry needs. For
    example, the technology will replace heavy metals and deliver corrosion protection
    exactly when and where it is needed. This will increase the life-time of the coatings,
    decrease maintenance costs, and reduce the energy and labor costs. This novel
    technology is simple, scalable, and will find application across multiple industry
    sectors such as construction, oil & gas, architecture, defense, aerospace etc.
    \n\nThe intellectual merit of this project is the development of smart, self-healing,
    polymer based nanocapsules as pigment additives in anticorrosive coatings. Corrosion
    is an electrochemical process and is induced by corrosive ions in the environment.
    At the onset of corrosion, the electrochemical potential at the corroding site
    changes. Hence, in this project polymer based nanocapsules will be developed that
    will inhibit corrosion by multiple mechanisms. The nanocapsules themselves will
    prevent corrosion by acting as ionic barrier between metal and toxic ions as well
    as by anodic passivation. If the passivation or the barrier effect fails due to
    scratch or mechanical damage and the metal starts to corrode, the change in electrochemical
    potential on the corroding metal surface will activate the nanocapsules to release
    corrosion inhibitors encapsulated in the capsules at the corroding site. This
    phase I project will develop a method to synthesize smart, self-healing nanocapsules
    encapsulated with corrosion inhibitor. These nanocapsules will deliver a next-generation,
    water-based, acrylic, epoxy or polyurethane based anticorrosive coatings into

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to prevent over $50 billion in wasted building utility costs annually across the US by increasing domestic shower efficiency.  Commercial adoption of this technology at scale will save 200 billion gallons of water and at least 1 trillion kWh of energy in the U.S. every year.  Reducing waste water and energy use decreases the strain on municipal water and energy infrastructure.  Lower energy use will also have a significant impact on carbon emissions associated with electric generation.  The innovation will enhance scientific and technological understanding by developing a highly-accurate novel sensing technology that works in hot and humid conditions.  Moreover, the occupancy detection technology can be used for other applications where difficult ambient conditions prevent the use of conventional sensors.  The IoT device will generate valuable end-user utility use behavior data which public institutions and private industry will use to design better policies and best practices.  In addition to the economic, technological and environmental benefits, this research also promotes jobs by providing enough utility savings to commercial buildings for them to increase their staff.

    The proposed project will eliminate behavioral water waste which occurs when a bather leaves a shower unoccupied even after the water has warmed-up.  Developing the technology requires: (1) a device that can accurately sense shower occupancy, (2) a compact enclosure resilient to a shower?s hot and humid environment and, (3) low energy circuitry and algorithms for long battery life.  Methods to achieve the project objectives include acoustic signal analysis for sensor accuracy, in-situ pilot testing, CAD design and prototyping to achieve device size constraints, and accelerated aging tests to ensure reliability and durability.  The overarching goal of this phase I feasibility effort is to validate the novel utility savings methodology, occupancy sensor accuracy and calibration over at least 5 years, and a device battery life of at least 2 years.  This project will be deemed successful if the following key technical objectives are met: (1) The sensor performs within at least a 1% error margin after relevant nondestructive, accelerated aging tests, (2) The amount of water and energy saved is at least 20% when compared to baseline during live hotel pilot tests, and (3) The device?s battery life is at least 2 years.

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is that it makes high-dimensional data visualization
    more accessible to mainstream users. An interactive multivariate visualization
    framework will assist users in the understanding of complex phenomena and help
    with decision making in the presence of multiple factors. It uses a map-like layout
    of factors and data that naturally appeals to a mainstream user's innate visual

    users can define areas in this layout that indicate parameter values of their

    interface and balance among the diverse impacts the various factors have on the
    decisions. Given the massive growth in the availability of multivariate data,
    the unique capabilities that the proposed framework provides are expected to have
    a strong impact on society, in many application domains and at many different
    levels - personal, business, finance, scientific, medicine, and so on. In short,
    this project will have a significant societal impact by allowing users to make

    Phase I project makes several intellectual and scientific contributions. A core
    contribution is the ability to embed high dimensional points and factors into
    a 2D plane or map, such that the distance between points has contextual meaning.
    This allows a single visualization to convey what currently takes a dashboard

    multivariate data. The same is true for the interactions defined on the layout,
    in particular those that allow users to derive the areas of influence of the various
    factors. Another intellectual contribution is the interface that allows users
    to focus their attention on specific attributes and deals with the mental and
    cognitive overload that may arise in users in the presence of too many factors
    and attributes. The proposed system constructs a meaningful hierarchical representation
    of the attributes that can be navigated within a novel space efficient visual
    interface. Using our design tools, anyone with an internet connection and a modern
    web browser will be able to create these layouts from multivariate data."

    of a new type of implantable medical device for cartilage repair in the knee.
    The implant is based on a novel material that is cartilage-like, as well 3D printed
    designs. Currently, cartilage damage in the knee is most effectively treated by
    a metallic joint replacement. However, qualifying patient age is 55 or older.
    There are several implants available to a younger and more active patient population,
    but they all suffer from major limitations such as low success rate, the size
    of the damage they treat, long recovery time or high cost. This project will mature
    an implantable device that can support weight and encouraging new bone and cartilage
    formation. The device is also made from a high performance yet low cost material,
    and 3D printing can create custom made and made to order devices that increase
    efficiency and further reduce cost. A low-cost device which can decrease recovery
    time and increase clinical success would greatly improve treatment of young patients,
    and prevent more advanced joint disease.  The project supports the NSF?s mission
    by increasing knowledge surrounding the manufacturing and clinical use of biologically
    significant materials for orthopedics. \n\nThis project will develop an ?on demand?
    device to adequately fill and support a critical-sized cartilage defect while
    quickly grafting to underlying subchondral bone, thus providing a new solution
    to the treatment of full-thickness cartilage tissue injury. Full-thickness cartilage
    lesions often are associated with a low rate of success and high patient morbidity
    (meaning 60% treatment failure) due to the need for adequate vasculature in the
    subchondral bone and integration with the cartilage graft. Researchers have used
    complex biomimetic nanomaterials and 3D printing to create strategies for joint
    repair. These materials work well in a controlled laboratory setting, but as is
    can only be printed using deposition or extrusion-based 3D printing techniques.
    This type of additive manufacturing is limited by resolution and print speed /
    volume when compared to commercial laser-based systems. The significance of this
    project is tied into improving clinical outcomes, with a more mechanically and
    biologically stable implant, while also addressing these manufacturing and cost
    issues. Thus, this project will validate the efficacy of an implantable cartilage

    Transfer (STTR) project will be the development and commercialization of a novel
    variety of corn that is high in carotenoids and orange in color, and with yields
    that are competitive with today's commercial hybrids.  In the diets of Americans,
    two important antioxidant carotenoids, lutein and zeaxanthin, are in low abundance.
    \ This deficiency has been associated with higher risk for degenerative diseases
    such as Age Related Macular Degeneration, and potentially, dementia. The ultimate
    goal of the proposed research is to get American's to consume more lutein and
    zeaxanthin, which will be achieved by increasing significantly the levels of these
    antioxidants in the most widely grown staple crop: Corn. Since corn is used in
    a wide variety of popular processed food formats, improving the carotenoid content
    of corn provides an opportunity to significantly increase the amount of health
    benefiting antioxidants that Americans consume, without changing consumers eating
    habits. However, in order for this strategy to be economically feasible, corn
    varieties that are high in carotenoids must be developed that are also high in
    grain yield. \n\nThis STTR Phase I project proposes to develop genetic markers
    for favorable alleles of genes associated with carotenoid biosynthesis and stability.
    There is considerable genetic variation in genes associated with carotenoid biosynthesis
    and stability, however, the most favorable alleles are typically not found in
    varieties that are commercially relevant to US corn production. Thus, the development
    of genetic markers will enable favorable alleles to be moved from lower yielding
    germplasm that is not well adapted to the US Corn Belt into elite inbreds suitable
    for the production of yield-competitive commercial F1 hybrids for the US market.
    The primary goal of this Phase I research is to create user-friendly genetic markers
    associated with favorable alleles for 12 key genes associated with carotenoid
    biosynthesis and stability. These markers will then be validated for efficacy
    by testing their ability to create progenies with higher carotenoid production,
    particularly lutein and zeaxanthin. This will result in a set of markers and experimental
    breeding materials that can be used to rapidly develop fixed inbreds for use in
    the production of yield-competitive high carotenoid F1 hybrids."

    This STTR Phase 1 project seeks to develop an automated system that would significantly increase the speed and accuracy of biopsy assessments at the point of care. The proposed technology eliminates extensive manual tissue processing steps and generates digital images of fresh biopsies that look just like standard pathology slides. The imaging can be performed in seconds, thus improving the efficiency of biopsy assessments at the point of care. Rapid, whole fresh biopsy imaging also improves evaluation accuracy while maximally preserving tissue for further testing and facilitating remote pathology consultation. With over five million patients in the United States undergoing biopsy procedures each year, and one in five of those patients returning for repeat procedures due to inaccuracies in biopsy assessments, an increase in accuracy and procedure speed could have a profound impact. This could lead to decreases in patient procedure time and decreases in repeat procedure rates, preventing unnecessary, painful, and invasive repeat biopsy procedures. With an estimated 1.6 billion USD spend on repeat procedures per year, this would also represent a significant decrease in financial burden on patients. In addition, due to the decrease in time per procedure, this could increase procedure throughput for hospitals, thus increasing hospital revenue potential. Finally, by producing remotely viewable images, this system could be utilized in a remote pathology setting at underserved communities within the US.

    This STTR Phase I project seeks to develop an automated sample processing and tissue pathology imaging system that delivers biopsy-to-image in a completely automated manner on fully-intact fresh tissues within five minutes of tissue removal.  Through integration with the previously developed Video-Rate Structured Illumination Microscopy (VR-SIM) system as the integrated optical sectioning modality, and using novel fluorescence dye combinations that recapitulate gold-standard histology,  the throughput, efficiency, and accuracy of biopsy evaluation can be improved while maximally preserving tissue for downstream processing and readily facilitating telepathology consultation. Preliminary work in multiple fresh tissue preparations, including core-needle biopsies and whole surgical resections,  indicates that the technology and method can deliver high image quality and diagnostic accuracy in short, clinically-relevant timeframes. A prototype of an automated, disposable cartridge system for biopsy staining and imaging for effortless integration with VR-SIM imaging will be developed. Image quality will be optimized at the highest optical sectioning power to be equivalent to physically-sectioned tissues, using polarization-gated VR-SIM and novel immersion media. ADPL workflow testing, validation of diagnostic image quality, and verification of compatibility with downstream analysis in human biopsy samples will be completed.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project lies in helping more amputees walk safely with less effort. There are approximately 800,000 individuals living with a major lower limb amputation, and this number is growing largely due to diabetes. For 50,000 amputees each year who need a new prosthetic knee, two options exist:  learn to use a traditional prosthetic knee or attempt to obtain a high-tech, computer-controlled knee. The former require the amputee learn and execute specific technique(s) to walk safely, while the latter do so automatically but cost $30,000 to $100,000 and require physical qualification, greatly limiting their availability. The novel prosthetic knee developed here offers stability automatically, regardless of amputee technique. It prevents buckling while simultaneously allowing the user to walk safely with whatever leg motions the user is able to generate. Since it requires no electronics or power, it is available to all amputees regardless of ability, and at a fraction of the cost of high-tech knees. Amputees will be able to walk farther with less effort, improving health and quality of life, and easing caregiver burden. Additionally, this design could be adapted for use in orthotic, robotic or exoskeletal systems.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop and test a novel prosthetic knee. Funding would be used to build prototypes and conduct mechanical, analytical and destructive testing. This testing is necessary to demonstrate that the design is feasible, safe for humans, and deserving of further development with amputees. An independent engineering design review will be obtained, prototypes will then be bench tested for function in a biomechanics lab, and an independent lab will provide destructive testing to prove ultimate strength of the device for comparison against known standards. The anticipated technical results include proof that the device can support the weight of a 300lb person, and quantitative evidence that the device will afford intuitive and universally available stability to amputees through its innovative swing- and stance-phase functionality. This work would advance the knowledge of prosthetics, rehabilitation and bipedal locomotion.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to reduce the power required to cool the data and telecommunications centers that drive the internet age. Currently nearly 2.0% of the energy consumed in the United States is used to run such data centers and, often, half of this is used for cooling. The corresponding greenhouse gas emissions will also be reduced. Longer term this technology can be adapted to increasing the efficiency of air-conditioning/refrigeration and power generation. Commercially, the computational fluid dynamics software market the product will compete in is projected to grow from $1.3 billion at present to over $2 billion by 2022. It will also stimulate the growth of the manufacture of specialty heat sinks with optimal geometries for efficient thermal management.

    This intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase I project is based on proposing to hybridize three common numerical methods, i.e., computational fluid dynamics (CFD), flow network modeling (FNM) and multi-variable optimization (MVO), a non-trivial objective. The result will be a software platform that can accurately and simultaneously optimize the geometry of an array of heat sinks found in various types of circuit packs, e.g., blade servers in data centers. This is not possible with CFD alone as it is too slow and it is not possible with FNM alone as it is not sufficiently accurate. The method of the hybrid approach to preserve the accuracy of CFD is to embed pre-computed, non-dimensional look-up tables of flow and thermal resistances from CFD simulations in an FNM. The software will accommodate both single-phase flows of air and water and evaporating/boiling flows of water and refrigerant, which requires modeling complex heat, mass and momentum transport phenomena. Experiments will validate its accuracy on thermal mock-ups of circuit packs.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) project is the creation of a control system that enables the next
    generation of high capacity lithium metal batteries to replace current lithium
    ion battery technology. The global lithium-ion battery market is expected to grow
    to $67.70 billion USD by end of 2022 from $31.17 billion USD in 2016. However,
    lithium ion batteries cannot store sufficient energy required by the applications
    contributing most to that growth (i.e., electric vehicles) as demonstrated by
    the slow adoption within the largest battery powered product markets today.  Lithium
    metal batteries were conceived decades ago and are capable of storing three times
    the energy of lithium ion batteries.  Yet inherent chemical instability renders
    them extremely dangerous to recharge, preventing their use.  This project is the
    next phase of work to develop a system that monitors and maintains the stability
    of lithium metal batteries during charging, enabling safe and reliable use by
    consumers, businesses, and government.  The complete solution will consist of
    licensable hardware and software which can be tailored to specific battery powered
    applications, integrating with battery cells or charging systems for consumer
    electronics, long range electric vehicles, medical devices, and grid storage systems.
    \ \n\nThis SBIR Phase I project funds the continued development of a new paradigm
    in battery healing: maintaining battery electrode health from the outside in.
    The system uses software and electronics that control surface issues on battery
    electrodes which otherwise cause permanent loss of capacity and life during normal
    use.  As an important part of the overall solution being developed, the key technical
    hurdles addressed by this proposed SBIR project are focused on real-time electrode
    surface sensing and mapping capabilities and control strategies to suppress dendrites,
    as well as advanced characterization methods to monitor and share electrode health
    information with other components to ensure safety, reliability and durability
    of the overall energy storage system. The R&D plan will include development of
    live mapping of electrochemically active surfaces, control software to develop
    an algorithm and feedback system, and machine learning to improve sensing-mapping-control
    strategies.  The most promising set of solutions will be demonstrated and validated
    in an operando visualization test cell that allows observation of the formation
    and suppression of dendrites on lithium metal electrodes.\n\nThis award reflects

    This SBIR Phase I project will explore the technical, commercial, and educational potentials of bringing augmented reality binocular kiosks to public locations and their ability to create lasting impact on the public's understanding of a place. The proposed research and development phase will focus on the deployment and field testing of a collection of prototypes with partner locations, and examine their efficacy at engaging and informing visitors of those sites. The broader significance of the project is the development of an information device and ecosystem that gives the public a better understanding of notable places and the greater physical world. Deployments will be able to visualize a variety of site-specific data, from environmental conditions, to geological formations and landmark navigation. Potential revenue can be generated in partnership with locations, allowing for sustainable long-term engagements between the project and a site. Direct economic impact is brought to a location and its surroundings through increased foot traffic and the encouragement of additional exploration of a space.


    The innovation being proposed is stereoscopic wide-field-of-view see-through augmented reality viewers in the form of landscape binocular kiosks designed to give public spaces a way to engage visitors with the natural, scientific, and historic features of that location. In addition to displaying immersive media experiences optically overlaid onto a view of the real world, this project creates a distributed media network on that location to share data and content for remote viewing and analysis. Goals and scope of research include durability testing of the devices in prolonged public exposure, effectiveness of the user interface and software tools, understanding the range and bandwidth of device-to-device communication, and optimization of the optical, electromechanical, and sensor components. Methods and approaches will include the field testing of prototype units with partner locations, and using survey and analysis techniques to evaluate the overall quantitative and qualitative efficacy of the intervention at those sites.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to provide analytical technology that will foster the commercial development of complicated biomanufactured products. The most pressing need is to reduce the time and cost to bring the latest generation of biotherapeutic drugs to market. Currently, upwards of eight years and $1B is spent to move a candidate drug from discovery through final approval. Along the way $300M is consumed by analytical testing procedures to certify the product.  The American healthcare system will benefit from new and less expensive analytical technologies that reduce certification costs and lead to less expensive drugs. Manufacturing efficiency also can be improved using the proposed technology. Biomanufactured products are harvested from cultured cells, and there are times when the culturing process fails to produce a perfect product. Detecting impurities and spoilage during manufacturing will further reduce manufacturing costs and directly benefit the consumer through the delivery of better therapeutic products and treatment regimens.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to quantify the validity of an ion mobility spectrometer as a high-throughput tool for screening conformational variation, purity, and aggregation of biotherapeutic drugs. Conformation imparts functionality to a protein and any variation in conformation implies there is a variation in biochemical activity, which is undesirable. Ion mobility is a technique that determines molecular cross-section, which in turn is a measure of a molecule's conformation. The gold standard for determining protein conformation is x-ray crystallography, a methodology limited by throughput. There is an unmet need to develop faster ways to measure protein conformation. The proposed technology determines a protein conformation rapidly across all phases of biotherapeutic drug development from discovery, expression system testing, scale up and manufacturing. Additionally, the patented design for this ion mobility spectrometer provides a way to measure changes in conformation that might result as a consequence of exposure to thermal, chemical, and photo-induced stress as needed for drug stability and developability testing.  The proposed work will quantify resolution, reproducibility, accuracy, and throughput for this benchtop instrument. The evaluation will be performed using antigen-antibody pairs and several biotherapeutic drugs in collaboration with an academic group and industry partners.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to sell affordable backup generators that provide 23 kilowatts, for operating a home's lights and appliances. With power outages due to natural disasters and an aging power grid becoming ever more frequent, and with society increasingly reliant on electricity to power not only lights and household appliances, but also computers, wireless routers, and medical devices, back-up power is an increasingly critical need. This SBIR's portable generator is expected to be more than an order of magnitude lower cubic size and weight, all at a reduced cost compared to existing generators.  The broader impact of this project is its significant benefits to the environment by providing backup power at high fuel efficiency (i.e. less consumption of non-renewable fossil fuels) and low emissions of hydrocarbons, particulate matter, carbon monoxide, and smoke.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to address the shortcomings of residential-use backup generators currently on the market. Available backup generators are either small and affordable but can only power a single appliance; or able to power most of a home's needs but cumbersome and expensive. This project will demonstrate the potential for implementing a free-piston internal combustion engine that will maximize fuel efficiency; minimize size; decrease dependence on lubricating oil; and incorporate an engine management system. The objective of the current effort is the engine, while the functioning compact generator will be developed in the next phase. In this free-piston engine design, the two pistons oscillate with forces in balance and reduced side-loads to the pistons, yielding a long-lasting high-speed engine. The pilot work included modification of the cylinder intake ports; addition of a modified squish band and dome to the cylinder head; and use of low-friction bearing materials yielding a successful prototype that runs on regular gasoline. The engineers will continue implementing, testing, and improving on these modifications. The successful completion of this project will yield an efficient, compact, low-weight, and low-emissions generator that produces 23 kilowatts of usable power that runs on standard pump gasoline.

    new capacitor technology based on kilohertz high-frequency supercapacitor, called
    AC-Supercap, aiming to replace conventional aluminum electrolytic capacitors (AECs)
    for a vast range of electronic and power systems. Capacitors are an essential
    component used in electronic devices, in power supplies driving electrical machines,
    appliances and instruments, as well as in power conversion and conditioning systems
    used for renewable energy generation. In the consumer electronics sector, miniaturization
    and low-profile or even flexible packaging, and higher power efficiency are some
    of the key demands. In the power system and other power-demanding industry sectors,
    large capacitance, large ripple current absorption, and high temperature rating
    are the key requirements. With the emergence of distributed wireless sensors and
    Internet of Things (IoT), pulse energy storage and generation will be necessary
    as well. AC-Supercap, with its much better performance than current solutions,
    is anticipated to better serve the needs of broad range of customers. Upon the
    success of this technology, there will also be tremendous impact on the local
    ecosystem and regional community of West Texas. \n\nThis Small Business Technology
    Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will investigate the feasibility of producing
    AC-Supercap as high-performance alternating current (AC) filtering capacitors
    for power modules, on-board application, or as compact and efficient pulse power
    storage. Conventional AECs, limited by their low capacitance density, bulky size,
    poor lifetime, large equivalent series resistance, and polarity sensitivity cannot
    meet technical needs well. To achieve AC-Supercaps with both large capacitance
    density and high-frequency response, two contradictory requirements, and nanostructured
    electrode engineering will be investigated. To produce a compact capacitor with
    a large voltage rating and capacitance, multicell integration will be optimally
    designed and demonstrated, which is crucial considering the intrinsic low voltage
    rating of a single cell. The proposed innovative solutions to these technical
    challenges will de-risk the AC-Supercap product prototyping in the following project
    phases to make ready the technology for commercialization. These research activities
    will advance the scientific understanding and technological development of nanostructured
    electrode process and property control, multicell integration design, and particularly
    AC-Supercap technology.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will demonstrate the ability to create a new family of biobased and biodegradable polymers produced from agricultural and forestry waste streams that have the potential to mitigate landfill-bound, single-use plastics prevalent in agricultural operations. In conventional agricultural operations, farmers use plastic mulch films to block weeds and retain moisture in the soil, ultimately increasing crop yields. Unfortunately, the non-degradable plastics that are used must be removed after harvest and sent to a landfill as they are not recyclable due to contamination by soil and pesticides, leading to significant labor and disposal costs and increasing environmental burden. In this project, lignin polymer alloys are investigated as an innovative biodegradable plastic platform which can be used as an alternative to conventional materials that are not recyclable. Agriculture films represent a global market of $2.5 billion. Other attractive market opportunities include agricultural containers ($5 billion), garbage bags ($10 billion), and packaging ($115 billion). Lignin as a renewable feedstock is an excellent candidate for low cost, biodegradable plastics. Successful demonstration of commercial-scale uses for lignin is vital for the emerging biorefinery industry, and a primary task to secure the energy and materials future for the US.

    The intellectual merit of this project addresses the need for low-cost, biobased plastics to replace petroleum derived materials, while ensuring a closed-loop lifecycle that does not generate financial and environmental burden due to waste accumulation. To date, lignin-based polymers have been prohibitively expensive due to the need for extensive solvent-based modification and separations processes. The objective of this research project is to demonstrate the production of lignin-polymer alloys with: 1) unmodified lignin contents of 50% or higher through solvent-free, high shear melt processing; 2) enhanced interfacial surface area for material durability; 3) mechanical properties near or exceeding that of low-density polyethylene; and 4) biodegradability under both ambient soil and thermophilic composting conditions. The expected technical results will be production of at least 1 optimal formulation meeting the above conditions identified as suitable for use in agricultural mulch film applications. If all 4 of these are achieved, further research in a subsequent Phase II award will allow for demonstration of scaled manufacturing of this new family of sustainable biomaterials and has the potential to lead to some of the first commercially viable lignin-based plastics in the US for use in agricultural plastic applications and beyond.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be a revolutionary, high-speed, high-resolution and extremely high-sensitivity camera. This Quanta Image Sensor (QIS) camera will be the only compact complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) camera in the market with photon counting capability at room temperature. This camera can be used in scientific and medical imaging applications where high sensitivity is extremely important and the current state-of-the-art camera technologies cannot satisfy the needs of the consumers, and customers are desperately seeking a better camera solution. The QIS is a platform imaging technology and can be used in a broad range of imaging applications, such as automotive, augmented-reality & virtual-reality, security & surveillance, etc., where high-sensitivity, high-resolution and high-speed are required. Moreover, since the QIS technology is compatible with the mainstream CMOS fabrication lines, it has the potential to dominate the image sensor and camera market by high-volume production. The image sensor market is expected to expand at an annual growth rate of 10.4% from 2015 to 2021, reaching $18.8 billion market value by 2021.

    The proposed project addresses the major drawbacks of the state-of-the-art scientific EMCCD cameras, such as high noise (around 1 electron with external cooling), nonlinear response and unpredictable readout gain, low-resolution, low-speed, massive size and extremely high power consumption. In this project, a manufactured QIS test chip will be implemented into a 1 megapixel prototype QIS camera which can function at 1000 frames/s and the whole camera power consumption will be less than a Watt. The average noise will be around 0.21 electrons that unlocks the true photon-number-resolving at room temperature with about 99% accuracy. The modular compact QIS camera will contain some peripheral digital IC chips, power supplies, FPGA, USB 3 interface, etc. A QIS image processing algorithm will be implemented in the camera module to form and output images from the binary bits received from the imager. Advanced industrial and commercial standard tests and characterizations will be performed to comprehensively measure the performance of the prototype QIS camera. Also, the camera will be tested by alpha-customers and their feedbacks will be received. In order to improve the development, the results will be applied in future QIS cameras in the Phase II of the SBIR program.

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is an improvement in how artificial limbs (prostheses)
    are fitted to the individual user. This promises better rehabilitation outcomes
    for people with limb loss, which lowers the risk of long-term health issues, such
    as accidental falls, back pain, or conditions that are associated with a sedentary
    lifestyle. All those risks can carry substantial direct and indirect costs for
    the individual and the society at large. There are approximately 2 million Americans
    who are living with limb loss, and who will potentially benefit from better prosthesis
    fit. Beyond the expected long-term benefits, these individuals will experience
    immediate benefits that include a more inconspicuous gait pattern, a reduction
    in skin and muscle soreness, and an increase in activity radius. The commercial
    impact of this research will extend to the industry of prosthetic componentry
    manufacturing. Currently, the structural elements of prostheses are mass-produced,
    strictly mechanical components. The proposed work will entail the integration
    of miniature sensors into those components, which will make them more valuable,
    and - along with the economical long-term benefits - justify higher unit prices
    and thereby a substantial growth potential for this $400M market. \n \nThe proposed
    project is focused on optimizing the static alignment of limb prostheses. This
    alignment needs to be carefully fine-tuned to each individual user of a prosthesis.
    The associated work is the domain of the prosthetist, who depends on experience,
    patient feedback, and intuition to achieve acceptable results. There are currently
    no easy ways to measure and track alignment changes throughout this process and
    therefore no data-based approaches to improving it. In the proposed project, small
    scale sensors will be integrated into the conventional alignable prosthesis components.
    These will provide continuous, accurate real-time measurements of alignment changes.
    It is planned to make those measurements available to the prosthetist via smartphone
    or tablet PC, so that they can help streamline the alignment optimization process.
    In the future, if it is possible to analyze the so collected data from thousands
    of alignment procedures, scientific methods can be applied to solve the problem
    of imperfect prosthesis alignments. The proposed work will be focused on customizing
    the sensors and associated hardware to existing standard components without making
    them much heavier or more expensive. Preliminary tests of the device with a sample
    of prosthetists are part of the planned Phase 1 project as well."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to develop a cell-based platform technology that can sense inflammatory sites and respond by producing anti-inflammatory factors to treat autoimmune diseases. There are more than 80 types of autoimmune disease with more than 23.5 million Americans affected. Autoimmune diseases are the number one cause of morbidity for women in the U.S., and one of the top 10 causes of death for women under 65 years old. The annual healthcare burden of these diseases is estimated at more than $100 billion in the U.S. alone. Current treatments for autoimmune diseases are effective for some patients, but a majority either do not respond or become refractory. Furthermore, standard drugs result in systemic immune suppression, which can cause severe and chronic side effects. Hence, there is substantial market need for anti-inflammatory drugs that can act locally at the site of inflammation, and deliver the "right dose at the right time" depending on the severity of the flare. If successful, the adaptive cell therapy platform being developed in this proposal will serve as the basis for a next-generation therapy to existing biologics.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a cell-based technology that localizes to a site of inflammation, senses inflammatory signals, and triggers the release of anti-inflammatory agents. The substantial technical and clinical progress made in recent years in synthetic biology and cell therapies is enabling development of this type of product. The goal is to design and optimize synthetic gene circuits to program cells to locally sense inflammatory signals such as TNFalpha and release anti-TNF drugs. The plan is to introduce these circuits into adult stem cells that have been used safely in numerous clinical trials against autoimmune diseases and have a well-established commercial development path. The engineered cells will be tested in culture to show input/output response to different levels of TNFalpha, and then tested in mouse models of disease. If successful, lead candidates will be further developed in a Phase II application.

Simultaneously, it will send the data to authorized officials for real-time strategic decision-making. By receiving access to life-critical information, the commander can make informed decisions on the allocation of key resources during the hectic scene of an emergency. Firefighting is chaotic; every year over one million firefighters risk their lives to protect others. Over 50% of the deaths in firefighting are caused by overexertion and stress, which can induce heart attacks as well as other serious medical issues. Furthermore, around 70,000 firefighting injuries occur each year. The proposed system aims to reduce the amount of firefighting injuries and subsequent costs, which totaled $7.8 billion in 2004, but the design is not limited to firefighting. The proposed system can be easily adapted to serve similar occupations such as military personnel and industrial workers.

    The proposed project may be the first to monitor the effects of the extreme nature of fire incidents with physiological stressors and provide this data in real-time. The proposed technology could significantly improve the occupational safety of firefighters and further enhance the scientific knowledge created by studying their physiological states. The proposed project includes three main technical objectives: 1) The research and development of a rugged wearable system that will monitor the physiology of firefighters in real-time. 2) The research and development of a machine learning algorithm to identify key markers that will indicate the exertion and stamina levels of first responders in chaotic environments. 3) The development of a long-range radio system capable of transmission within large urban structures comprising various possible interferences. All three objectives will consist of two pilot studies with an intermittent development phase in between, where feedback from the first pilot study will be incorporated into both the hardware and software. It is expected that the outcomes of this project will demonstrate a significant reduction in firefighter injuries, paving the way for a clear return on investment for the partnering fire departments.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to significantly reduce primary care physician shortages and improve quality of care for low income patients in the United States by developing a tool that analyzes clinical care team performance data at federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) to automatically deploy individually tailored eLearning support for staff members that enables patient centered team based care.  FQHCs are funded by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to serve 22 million low income patients living in more than 10,000 of the poorest communities across the Nation.  Well-implemented patient centered team-based care has the potential to significantly reduce physician shortages and burden of chronic disease which disproportionately affects low income communities. However, efforts to move and sustain FQHCs participation in this model have had limited success with only 66% attaining patient centered medical home (PCMH) recognition in 2016.  Various public initiatives, including the Health Resources and Service Administration Quality Improvement Award and Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act (MACRA), are providing additional financial incentives to move primary care practices towards PCMH Recognition. However, current approaches to practice transformation are cumbersome and difficult to sustain.

    The proposed project seeks to disrupt continued health professional education at FQHCs by assessing the feasibility of developing a tool that leverages electronic health record data to identify gaps in patient centered team based care for diabetic patients and deploys tailored asynchronous individualized e-learning nudge type support to each member of the care team based on their performance.  The research objectives of this SBIR Phase 1 are to establish the feasibility of using EHR data through an API to trigger individual user and team level flags for variation from a specific set of PCMH standards and diabetes clinical protocols; to develop algorithms that generate an individualized learner user profile and teams level reports; to generate data to design algorithms that learn from user preferences, impacts on flags and patient outcomes; to design user interphase for reward and recognition and to evaluate end user acceptance of eLearning tools.  The research will be approached using user centric design, behavioral economics and adult learning principles to gather specific requirements and develop a minimum viable product focused on a subset of between five to 10 indicators.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable the development of a unique wearable
    scuba-diving device that will eliminate the risk of Decompression Sickness (DCS),
    by monitoring in real time the formation of nitrogen bubbles in the body of the
    user while in the dive. The risk to develop DCS while conducting underwater activities
    occurs during the ascension phase, when the changing pressure may yield the formation
    of nitrogen bubbles in tissues and body. The presence of bubbles triggers a variety
    of serious injuries with long term consequences and even death. Any professional
    and licensed recreational scuba training makes trainees aware about the risks
    associated to DCS. Divers are instructed to follow ascent rates and safety stops
    according with criteria established from statistical considerations of empirical
    data. Nevertheless, DCS is suffered by rule-abiding divers during 3% of the immersions,
    requiring costly and distressing evacuation and treatment with hyperbaric chambers.
    The wearable device will alert the scuba-diver before the sickness develops, reducing
    the risk to suffer DCS, making underwater activities simpler and safer. \n\nThe
    proposed project plans to demonstrate an innovative ultrasonic resonant concept
    adapted from the acoustic chamber notion. Acoustic chambers are structures which
    are belted by piezoelectric arrangements which are set to deform expanding and
    compressing when subjected to oscillating electric voltages. The frequency of
    oscillations can be set to match the modes of vibration of the media entering
    in resonance. Under such conditions the setup is extremely sensitive to minor
    changes in the elastic properties of the system, such as those induced by the
    presence of compressible bubbles. This project will execute a plan to produce
    a wearable design of the piezoelectric array. Artificial intelligence as well
    as conventional methods will be employed to analyze the electrical disturbances,
    and relate them to the bubbles sizes in real time. The computing, data acquisition
    and power requirements will be determined. Ultimately, these results will determine
    the feasibility to integrate all the required components in an autonomous wearable
    DCS risk detection device by a scuba diver."

    demonstrate the commercial feasibility of a manufacturing platform for functionalizing
    textile materials with smart functionality such as for wearable smart garments
    developed out of the NSF funded ASSIST Engineering Research Center for Self-powered
    Wearable Nanosystems. Smart garments have been touted as the next sensing platform
    for acquiring biometrics such as electrocardiogram, heart rate, or heart rate
    variability. However, mass adoption has been difficult due to the high production
    cost, leading to a small market segment within the greater wearable technology
    market. As demonstrated by our customer discovery through the NSF I-Corps program
    in Fall 2016, the biggest barrier to adoption is the production cost. This project
    seeks to decrease the cost by 5x and decrease production time by 36x, enabling
    this market segment to grow for applications in health & wellness, healthcare,
    and beyond. By employing high-throughput direct-write printing and deposition
    of functional dielectric and conductive materials from the printed electronics
    space, high-value data generating devices such as smart garments can be manufactured
    in a single step bridging established practices within the textile and electronics
    industry resulting in automated textile electronics. Novel materials will be explored
    to impart functionalities on existing textiles with our manufacturing platform.
    \n\nThe broader impact of this project is to create a single manufacturing platform
    that marginalizes the cost of production for textile electronics such as smart

    from 3D printing, printed electronics, and textile science to create disruptive
    advancements in the emerging field of smart textiles and textile electronics,
    creating new knowledge and commercial innovations. Lastly, manufacturing within
    the USA has seen a resurgence due to value-added technical textiles manufacturing
    being brought back. An ancillary broader impact of this project is to serve as
    a driver for value-added smart garment manufacturing technologies to be employed
    for USA manufacturing. Success of this project's vision will allow for low-cost
    smart textiles to usher in a paradigm shift for the textiles industry, allowing
    for a multitude of use-cases and innovative business models to proliferate, ultimately

    This SBIR Phase I project will help advance the health and welfare of individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS) - a debilitating chronic inflammatory disease affecting nearly 1 million people in the United States. A non-invasive, wearable retinal imaging device will be developed for at-home patient use that detects changes in MS disease activity, enabling patients and their physicians to track responses to treatment and detect disease flare-ups between clinical visits. Early detection and proper treatment of MS is crucial to reducing the risk of disease progression and disability. Current practice relies on infrequent neurological and radiological exams to assess changes in disease activity and treatment efficacy. However, there is currently no way to monitor MS in real time between these visits. Research relating retinal pathology to MS processes in the brain demonstrate that retinal imaging can provide early detection of disease events, offering an alternative monitoring pathway. This device will thus help reduce increases in patient healthcare costs associated with increasing disability, and potentially impact the research and care of patients with other brain conditions that manifest in the retina, including traumatic brain injury, epilepsy, and addiction. Following FDA approval, the device will be sold to MS patients, neurologists, and researchers.

    This project will yield a novel retinal imaging device that uses optical coherence tomography (OCT) and fundus autofluorescence (FAF) to assess retinal biomarkers associated with MS progression. While OCT and FAF are widely-used modalities for imaging the retina, the proposed device differentiates itself from current technologies in that it is specifically designed for use by MS patients at home. This will include a ruggedized, ergonomic, and wearable design suited for those who suffer from low mobility and other symptoms that make trips to a clinic difficult. Patients will use the device briefly once a week, during which time retinal images will be automatically acquired, analyzed, and sent to a physician for remote review. As such, it will further increase engagement between patients and physicians by making patients more proactively involved in their disease management. For this project, the following objectives are planned: 1) Develop the OCT component of the device to acquire high-resolution and repeatable images of layers in a healthy tissue-mimicking phantom retina, 2) Develop the FAF component of the device, and 3) Validate the device?s ability to acquire high-resolution and repeatable images of retinal layer thicknesses and autofluorescence in post-mortem retinas from MS patients and healthy individuals.

    medicine combines the principles of the life sciences, cell biology, and engineering
    to create functional tissues and organs that can be used for replacing damaged
    tissues and organs. The public health benefit of replacing damaged tissues and

    in artificial tissue grafts, which is one of the major causes of tissue failure,
    by developing an oxygen imaging instrument to generate three-dimensional in situ
    oxygen maps. This instrument will allow scientists to assess oxygen environment

    and will help create high-tech jobs in the Midwest. \n\nThe oxygen imager will
    be based on the innovative noninvasive electron paramagnetic resonance oxygen
    imaging (EPROI) technology. EPROI uses an injectable water-soluble, non-toxic
    contrast agent, trityl that has oxygen-dependent relaxation rates. EPROI provides
    absolute partial oxygen pressure (pO2) maps with high accuracy (~ 1 torr) within
    1-10 minutes. The oxygen imager will be equipped with a 25 mT magnet and ~720
    MHz electronics suitable for in vitro and small animal in vivo oxygen imaging.
    The instrument will have user-friendly software for image acquisition, image registration,
    data processing and analysis. This project will develop the magnet with the top
    loading of samples along with temperature and gas controlled bioreactor sample
    chamber for in vitro oxygen mapping of artificial tissues. The robustness and
    performance of the imager will be tested by acquiring oxygen maps of cell-seeded

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase I project aims at developing a roll-to-roll, solid-state, continuous process for manufacturing nanocellular thermoplastic films with open (interconnected) or closed (not interconnected) cells of the order 10-100 nm and as much as 50% porosity. The initial application of this proposed project is an improved Lithium-ion battery separator comprising a nanoporous polyetherimide (PEI) film of 10-25-micron thickness with uniformly distributed interconnected 10-50 nm size cells. The nanoporous PEI separator, which has significantly higher heat resistance than current polyolefin-based separators, addresses a very urgent safety issue, i.e., batteries exploding and causing fire due to thermal instability of the separator. Moreover, compared to the current multi-step process for fabricating battery separators, this continuous process will have higher productivity thereby increasing the nation's global competitiveness in battery manufacturing. The total addressable global market for separators used in both primary (single-use) and secondary (rechargeable) lithium batteries is projected to be $1.65 billion by 2020 growing at 4.7%. This innovative research project will contribute to new knowledge in the areas of gas diffusion and cell nucleation in thermoplastic polymeric films and enable development, characterization and application of a whole new class of solid-state nanocellular polymer films.

    The intellectual merit of this project resides in the development of a manufacturing process that brings together interdisciplinary knowledge to synthesize and characterize nanostructures under various process conditions. This new knowledge will advance the field of nanomanufacturing and will be used to optimize processes towards commercialization targets. There are two technical challenges: (i) the dynamic seal concept, which has been proven in a 250-micron thick polymer film but not for a film 10-20 times lower in thickness; and (ii) maintaining enough gas concentration during the cell nucleation and growth to create nano-sized cells. The goals of this project are to: (a) establish the feasibility of a roll-to-roll process operating at a minimum speed of 1 meter/minute to produce nanocellular thermoplastic films and (b) develop a 100-mm wide, 10-25 micron thick nanoporous polyetherimide (PEI) film having the desired properties and nanostructure profile for a Li-ion battery separator application. These two goals will be achieved by implementing the dynamic seal technology to process a 100-mm wide film on a continuous basis and immediately heating the film to create nanocells.

    Research (SBIR) project is to revolutionize the US solar cell market with low-cost
    and high-efficiency solar cells. The development of cost-effective and efficient
    solar power technologies is of national interest because solar power has broad
    potential to support US priorities such as economic growth and job creation, as
    well as mitigation of climate change. However, the cost of solar energy is still
    high, and technological innovations are needed to further lower costs and increase
    efficiency. The efficiency of perovskite solar cells has surged to over 22% in
    five years of research and now rivals that of CdTe and Si-based solar panels.
    Perovskite inks are made from Earth-abundant, inexpensive precursors and can be
    printed on plastic foils, which can significantly reduce their manufacturing and
    installation costs. However, before commercialization of this technology can be
    considered, device stability and the feasibility of reliable, scalable manufacturing
    of large-area panels have to be established. This project will bridge this critical
    knowledge gap and develop manufacturing technology that can compete in terms of
    cost and performance not only with other solar panels but also with conventional
    fossil fuel-based energy sources. \n\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop
    scalable, reliable, reproducible, and cost-effective technology to manufacture
    perovskite photovoltaic devices using an industry-proven slot die coating technique.
    Most research lab perovskite solar cell devices are fabricated via spin casting,
    and have a device area of less 1 sq. cm. Despite the impressive progress of this
    technology, its commercially viable scalability and reliability have not yet been
    demonstrated. In this project, slot-die coating will be used, which is a proven
    technology to be scalable for large area processing and robust for high-yield
    manufacturing in a wide range of applications. We will use the slot die coating
    method and air stable p-i-n devices architecture to manufacture perovskite solar
    panel with a target power conversion efficiency of 20%, operational lifetime of
    more than 10,000 hours, power-to-weight ratio of 1 kW/kg, and target manufacturing
    cost of less than $0.3/W, which is more than a 40% reduction in costs when compared

    The broader impact/ commercial potential of the Small Business technology Transfer (STTR) project is to develop a bioreactor that may be used for production and expansion of cells for regenerative medicine, tissue engineering, and drug discovery.  While significant advances have been made in developing strategies for the culture and differentiation of pluripotent stem cells, there is a critical gap in scaling these processes up to the number of cells required for clinical and research applications.  The specific focus of this project is the scale-up of beta islet cells for the treatment of diabetes. Diabetes currently affects 400 million people worldwide leading to 5 million deaths a year. There is currently no cure. A source of transplantable islet cells could alleviate many diabetic complications and restore the quality of life for millions of individuals.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to develop and test a novel wicking bioreactor and bioprocess for expansion of human pluripotent-derived beta islet cells. More specifically, this will require focusing on 3 major objectives:  i)Optimizing the cellulosic surface of the wicking matrix with chemical and extra cellular matrix additions to ensure attachment and proliferation of the islet cells; ii)optimizing controlled differentiation parameters such as oxygenation levels and feed rates to achieve a 10 fold increase in differentiated cells; and iii) develop a process using physical and biochemical means to remove the differentiated cells from the matrix while maintaining cellular integrity both in terms of viability and phenotype.  These studies will serve as proof-of-principle of the proposed bioreactor for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine applications.

    This SBIR Phase 1 project will create an educational technology that accelerates the acquisition of foundational English language skills by children (4 to 10 years old), by melding English and Spanish language instruction, delivered via a personalized digital learning platform. Using state-of-the-art text-to-speech and speech-to-text engines, students that are English Language Learners (ELL) will engage in deliberate literacy practice across the four modalities of language (listening, speaking, reading, writing). Over the last decade, the number of ELL students enrolling in public schools has steadily increased while there remains a shortage of bilingual or certified ELL teachers. Technology can help these teachers to personalize instruction and extend the school day which in turn increases engaged learning time. Achieving college and career readiness is an economic imperative for all students, especially ELL students given the importance of English communication skills to career success. While developing technologies for use in classrooms by young children can be a risky proposition due to the nature of the modern classroom, the reward far outweighs the risk. This project will produce a high-impact technology solution designed for young children that integrates the latest text-to-speech and speech-to-text technologies and is grounded in sound research about language skill acquisition across the four modalities.

    The key innovation of this SBIR Phase 1 project is a plurilinguistic (e.g., Spanish and English) approach to literacy development across the four modalities of language (e.g., reading, writing, speaking, listening) where young students (aged 4-10 years old) are immersed in personalized learning experiences specifically tailored to support and accelerate language development. The first research goal is to test the feasibility for using and adapting proprietary English and Spanish language text-to-speech and speech-to-text engines with young children. The second research goal is to examine the impact of a dual-language personalized learning platform on children?s acquisition of foundational listening, speaking, reading, and writing skills. Participants will be ELL students whose first language is Spanish. The research is based on a plurilinguistic framework for second language acquisition; researchers hypothesize that a dual-language application that leverages students' first language to learn English will score significantly higher on independent measures of foundational literacy skills and self-efficacy for learning compared to students who are using an English-only personalized learning application. A mechanism of growth may be the amount of time students are immersed in deliberate practice of literacy skills. A dual-language personalized learning platform has the potential to extend teacher-led literacy instruction and increase the amount of time students spend engaged in learning English.

    compound that will be tested in clinical trials.  This process can take years,
    billions of dollars, and in the worse case leads to compounds that fail during
    clinical trials due to safety concerns.  Advances in microfluidics and 3D-printing
    have enabled the construction of tissue culture devices with nearly unlimited
    numbers of tissue chambers and flow channel complexity.  Combined with optical
    sensors with unprecedented sensitivity, instrumentation can be built that maintain
    large numbers of biopsied tissue samples, while assessing the effects of exposure
    of the tissue to libraries of drugs.  This technological platform provides resolution
    of drug effects on human tissue with high sensitivity thereby reducing the cost
    of animal testing and the risk of bringing toxic drugs to clinical trials and
    the market.  In addition, the technology will impact the fields of personalized
    medicine, where drugs could be tested on an individual?s own tumor or tissue,
    and environmental health.  \n\nMeasuring in vitro cellular responses to pharmaceutical
    compounds is critical for identifying toxic effects of candidate drugs prior to
    costly in vivo animal and clinical testing. To address this need, instrumentation
    to maintain and assess biopsied tissue in real time is being developed.  The technology
    utilizes microfluidics for optimal maintenance of tissue viability and function,
    and optoelectronics to measure oxygen uptake with unprecedented sensitivity. The
    fluidics are driven by gas pressure, circumventing the need for unwieldy pumps,
    and the channels are fabricated by 3D printing, allowing for nearly unlimited
    numbers of chambers and flow channel complexity. The technological platform will
    aid in the selection of lead compounds for clinical trials, estimation of doses
    for first-in-human tests, and support applications to the FDA.  In this Phase
    1 SBIR proposal we will build 2 96-channel turnkey instruments for a contract
    research program and for beta testing by pharmaceutical companies. The functionality
    of a low-capacity (8-channel) system has been previously demonstrated.  The funding
    will support scaling up the throughput of the system as well as enabling additional
    modes of operation. The instrumentation will be used for contract research and
    for direct sales to the large market of drug discovery within the pharmaceutical
    industry."

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase I Project will productize a quantitative data processing
    technology in dynamic positron emission tomography (PET). Dynamic PET's distinction
    from its static counterpart is in the fact that it collects time-dependent tracer
    concentration data. It is a highly sensitive and accurate way of functional and
    molecular imaging of protein targets such as biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease,
    Parkinson's disease, or brain trauma. Unfortunately, dynamic PET is rarely used
    in clinic because of long imaging time and complex processing. The technology
    to be developed in this proposal will shorten the required imaging time and simplify
    the analysis, allowing for accurate and reliable imaging of disease biomarkers
    for aiding drug development, clinical diagnostics, and treatment monitoring. The
    proposed analytic workflow will be offered as a cloud-based service that can be
    used by the customers to analyze new or historical PET datasets. In order to overcome
    the established practice of relying on less accurate and informative static PET
    imaging, the grant recipients plan to conduct a thorough validation of the new
    technology using a dedicated physical phantom and human subject images acquired
    in the past. The largest impact of the new technology is expected in medical research
    and drug development. \n\nThe accepted practice of analyzing dynamic PET datasets
    involves reconstruction of the parameters of implied compartment model describing
    the tracer biochemistry, which involves several accuracy-degrading approximations
    and requires lengthy acquisition. The alternative approach proposed in this project
    relies on decomposing the dynamic PET image sequences using a combination of several
    processing techniques that incorporate the essential features of tracer pharmacokinetics
    without making explicit assumptions about the model parameters or about the underlying
    anatomy. The key part of the proposed methodology is factor analysis of dynamic
    structures, a non-negative matrix decomposition technique with successful past
    applications in radionuclide image analysis. The result of the workflow is a 3D
    concentration of tissues that exhibit specific-binding of the radiotracer. In
    order to validate the quantitative accuracy of the approach, the researchers will
    build and image a dedicated physical phantom capable of producing overlapping
    distributions with different tracer dynamics. In order to validate the scan-time
    reduction claims, the new workflow will be used to analyze existing dynamic PET
    human subject datasets using increasingly shorter input time windows.\n\nThis
    award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
    evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to create sustainable and biodegradable polyurethane products made from algae oils. Algae-based polymer precursors will be developed and used to produce finished polyurethane product with the desired physical characteristics. Development of polyurethane shoe soles will be targeted, including polyurethane flip-flops, as these are products where consumers are increasingly demanding the incorporation of sustainable materials and where the consumer is willing to pay the small extra cost associated with incorporating renewable materials. Developing algae polymers and high value products made from these will allow us to develop a novel monomer toolbox based on these bio-materials and to create new polymers with physical properties equal or superior to petroleum based polymers. These algae based polymers also provide cleaner, smarter products- pollution prevention at the molecular level. The development of environmentally sustainable and biodegradable products will reduce waste, prevent costly end-of-life remediation, lead to safer products and save energy and water resources. The development of these algae based polymer products will enable renewable materials to supplant petroleum-based materials while maintaining the performance characteristics of polyurethane products that consumers have come to appreciate.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop sustainable monomers from bio-based algae feedstocks that will be used to create finished polyurethane soft foams that have the appropriate properties for shoe soles. It incorporates the preparation of algae-based polyols from multiple algae oil sources, going from bench to production scale, followed by formulation of these monomers into materials that meet the demands of a discerning eco-conscious consumer. The developed algae polyols will not be formulaic direct drop-in replacements for the corresponding petroleum sourced materials' careful formulation will be required to generate polyurethanes with the desired final product properties, and that are also compatible with current manufacturing techniques. Formulation and process compatibility are key steps, as industrial users are not looking to significantly modify manufacturing processes to incorporate new starting materials. Lastly, physical evaluation of the resulting polyurethanes will be done by comparing the performance metrics between bio and petroleum-based polyurethanes typically used by end users in sportswear and automotives. Using polyols derived from multiple algal strains, a polyurethane formulation for soft foams will be developed to demonstrate our ability to integrate product development and manufacturing, from sustainable feedstock and green chemistry through commercial application.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology
    Transfer (STTR) project is the advancement of improved lithium ion batteries.
    The project will evaluate new battery chemistry enabling more rapid charging rates
    then currently available in the worldwide energy storage marketplace. Such high
    power density batteries would cater to a major emerging battery segment where
    current lithium ion battery technologies fall dramatically short. Successful development
    of this innovation will provide benefits to both current and future applications.
    Clearly, large scale deployment of a markedly superior energy storage device will
    have significant societal benefits by accelerating the move away from fossil fuel
    in many applications and products. For instance, a viable regenerative braking
    energy storage technology based on the proposed technology would result in a tremendous
    reduction in electricity used by subway trains, with a concomitant reduction of
    CO2 emissions. \n\nThis STTR Phase I project proposes to address the core of the
    microstructure - performance relations in energy storing materials, answering
    a series of fundamental questions regarding how a charge carrier is reversibly
    or irreversibly stored at high rates in manganese oxide - carbon nanocomposite
    anodes. In conventional LIBs, it is the graphite-based anode that limits charging
    rates, with catastrophic lithium metal plating and dendrite growth occurring at
    increased currents. It is expected that many of the existing \"Graphite - Inherited\"
    paradigms regarding fast rate in anodes would be done away with, or substantially
    redefined with the proposed approach for designing high power lithium ion batteries
    based on an inexpensive hemp-derived carbon nanosheets and nanostructured manganese
    oxide anodes. A much clearer understanding of the synthesis - structure - property
    relations in such nanocomposites will have wide-reaching scientific and technological
    implications. Research and development activities will focus on structural optimization
    and manufacturing scalability along with fabrication and testing of near-commercial

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project is to develop an external stent that can improve the quality and length of life for dialysis patients. Dialysis is the primary lifeline for End-Stage Renal Disease patients. Unfortunately, our current standard of care, which provides no additional support or treatment to the artery-vein connections surgically created in the arm to initiate dialysis (i.e. access sites), results in 40-60% failure rates within the first year. Consequences of these failures are dire: significant pain, suffering, and death for dialysis patients, hospital readmission penalties, and more than $1B in direct costs to Medicare. An external stent that wraps around the vein-artery/-graft junction of dialysis patients at the time of access site creation surgery has been developed to reduce these failures in a preventative fashion. In order to maximize the impact that it can have on the lives of dialysis patients by providing favorable flow conditions (i.e. hemodynamics) through the access site, it is imperative to first optimize device design on the bench with the aid of computational modeling. Findings from this grant will further scientific understanding of external supports and the role that hemodynamics play in access site failures.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to create a computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model that successfully predicts flow and deformation conditions at the access site in the presence or absence of an external stent, and to use this model to identify external stent design parameters that promote the most favorable hemodynamic environment for preventing access site failures. First, a 3D printing method of manufacture will be optimized to enable the fabrication of external stents in a highly-repeatable manner conducive to large-scale, FDA-compliant production. A CFD model will be created from empirical results in which surgically-constructed anastomoses (e.g. vein-graft junctions) are exposed to arteriovenous-mimetic pressure and flow conditions in the absence or presence of external stent designs. Empirical ex vivo data to validate the CFD model simulation results will be collected from quantitative measurements of dynamic deformation (e.g. magnitude of expansion) and flow patterns (i.e. velocity fields) in the presence or absence of various external stent designs via 4D flow MRI, which provides spatial and temporal information on 3D flow over the entire anastomosis. This work should result in the identification of a few designs that assert hemodynamic effects conducive to reducing neointimal hyperplasia, the primary culprit of access site failures.

    light required to inactivate common clinical pathogens known to cause surgical
    site infections, and test a prototype antimicrobial light emitting dressing that
    uses the bactericidal effects of blue light to inactivate surface colonizing bacteria
    and disinfect surgical sites. The potential outcomes of the proposed activity
    are the development of a thin reusable blue light-emitting bandage that provides
    effective post-operative site disinfection, ultimately reducing nosocomial related
    infections. The proposed activity would further the development of antimicrobial
    blue light therapy devices, providing novel solutions to surgical site infections,
    Central Line Bloodstream Associated Infections, and wound infections, because
    of blue light therapy's proven ability to inactivate a wide range of clinical
    pathogens regardless of their resistance to antibiotics, ability to improve wound
    healing, and ability to inactivate bacteria in the biofilm state. The outcomes
    of this project will aid in providing a cost saving solution to Healthcare Associated
    Infections by reducing their occurrence, reducing the risks of human error, and
    improving accountability, quality and workflow. \n\nOptimization of blue light
    therapy is needed for clinical application for killing bacteria on the surface
    of patient's surgical sites, because of a radiant energy threshold that must be
    passed to inactivate bacteria. Due to the variation in devices and doses used
    in previous studies, combined with the clinical need for a device which can be
    easily incorporated into standard infection prevention protocols, further experimentation
    is needed with a device designed as a wearable for clinical implementation.  Objective
    1: Determine optimal light dose (fluence) of blue light (405 nm) required to inactivate
    common gram positive and gram negative bacteria known to cause SSIs. Using in
    vitro techniques, determine the total fluence of light and treatment times required
    to achieve bacterial disinfection of at least a one log reduction in bacteria
    colony forming units.  Objective 2: Optimize device to deliver the effective irradiance
    while maintaining surface temperature below 43 Degree Celsius for safe use on
    tissue. The device is to not exceed 43 Degree Celsius on the surface of the device's
    therapeutic surface while delivering effective irradiance, from Objective 1, for
    inactivation of bacteria on surfaces.  Objective 3: Test the device's infection

    a porcine SSI model with surface-inoculated sutured incisions, made to the depth
    of the fascia, with optimized light-emitting antimicrobial bandage. Success criteria
    for bacterial disinfection is at least a 90% reduction of CFU per gram of tissue

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to develop an orthopedic device to quantify joint mobility. Millions of musculoskeletal injuries occur each year, which results in pain, swelling, and limitations in joint movement. Unfortunately, current joint mobility and ligament assessments are dependent on the clinician?s qualitative evaluation of the ?feel? of a joint, which often results in ineffective treatment. Failure to provide proper treatment delays restoration of motion, inhibits the return of prior function, and leads to lost wages and increased healthcare costs. The goal of this proposal is to develop a transformative device to quantitatively assess joint mobility of the shoulder, elbow, wrist, knee, and ankle. The aim is to take standardized clinical techniques currently performed in a qualitative manner to that of an objective and quantitative mode of assessment. Not only will this device be a first to market product, it will allow us to begin to develop the science of joint mobilization techniques. In addition, the device will accentuate the educational experience for emerging professionals via objective feedback to ?learn? to deliver consistent interventions to each patient. Thus, this device will capitalize on technology to enhance the practice of orthopedics.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a product to quantitatively measure joint movement. Currently, joint mobility and ligament assessments are performed qualitatively (i.e., clinician evaluates the ?feel? of a joint). However, treatments must be precise to enable the return of prior function. Inappropriate treatment can delay restoration of motion, inhibit the return of prior function, and lead to lost wages and increased healthcare costs. The goal of the proposed device is to enable accurate, simple, and inexpensive measurement of the magnitude of linear translation between two joint surfaces of multiple joints. In preliminary testing, we accurately measured millimeters of motion. We now propose to develop a compact, portable prototype that represents the ?best fit? contours for the shoulder, elbow, wrist, knee, and ankle. The use of attachable dovetail interfaces designed for each joint will allow the use of the same device on a variety of joints and permit the device to be interfaced between the patient?s joint and the clinician?s hand to enable the development of standardized protocols. An immediate display of the linear translation will appear via LED. This real-time feedback will impact clinical decision-making and support consistency of techniques for efficacious treatments.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR)
    project is to improve outcomes and decrease costs in the mental health space by engaging
    patients starting with their first therapy session through objective progress reporting and
    post-session motivation. Patients and clinicians alike will be able to track and assess treatment
    progress through self-reported and physiological measures. This innovation builds upon the
    strong academic, government, and industry partnerships that will advance research and
    innovation in the field of biotechnology. By demonstrating improved outcomes and decreased
    costs associated with the utilization of technology, this will pave the way for insurance
    reimbursement (using existing CPT codes) to accelerate market adoption. Additionally, as
    education of patients and the public improves regarding mental health and PTSD in particular,
    the negative stigma surrounding these conditions will decrease and more people in need will
    seek help rather than resorting to unhealthy behavior or even suicide.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to represent an innovative approach that provides easy to
    interpret results tailored to mental health providers, patients, and other non-technical users.
    Current mental health treatment and assessment has lacked qualitative, scientifically-based
    measurement. The need for a scientific measurement is evident, as about 8 percent of all
    adults - 1 of 13 people in this country will develop PTSD during their lifetime. Currently, 60%
    of adults diagnosed with a mental illness don't receive mental health treatment; using proven
    science and physiologic measurements as the foundation for improving treatment and
    monitoring progress for PTSD can help to alleviate some of the stigma surrounding mental
    illnesses. This project aims to demonstrate how implementing a web-based platform can
    improve PTSD treatment by providing physiologically relevant feedback to the patient and by
    providing a tool for the clinician to tailor the therapy to the individual patient. Patients will have
    their subjective measures and physiological data visualized throughout treatment on a software
    platform, with progress being tracked through validated assessment scales. Patients will be
    compared to others in treatment as usual. Results should yield improved quality of life and
    decrease long term healthcare costs for those that use the platform.

    This SBIR Phase I project will develop an extended depth imaging variation of optical coherence tomography (OCT). OCT is an optical imaging method that can visualize tissue structures up to 1mm deep with microscopic resolution. It has been well adapted for retinal imaging but although available for skin imaging application, the performance and price point are not sufficient to encourage market adoption. Building on NSF supported research at Duke University, this project will extend the depth range of OCT from the current 1-2 mm, which is only the most superficial layer of skin, to 3-4 mm, enabling full imaging of skin layers down to the dermal junction. This will enable dermatologists to access OCT without a large financial outlay and provide a non-invasive imaging modality in the office setting.

    Extended depth imaging is also applicable to dental imaging and may allow dentists to reduce the need for X-ray imaging by providing cross sectional images of teeth and gums. Since these OCT instruments are highly portable, the deep imaging system can be widely used, across lab benches, in the field or shared throughout a medical office. This project will support the development of new products and the teams that design and build them. Extended depth imaging OCT uses a novel design to dramatically increase the depth penetration of OCT into skin, teeth and other samples. By using distinct illumination and collection apertures, extended depth (or dual axis) OCT can triangulate the signal to layers deep beneath the tissue surface. Compared to previous OCT systems, this increases the imaging depth by a factor of 2. This innovation will be combined with proprietary spectrometer design, which was developed to take advantage of 3D printing methods, to develop a disruptive new instrument for imaging with the performance and price necessary for commercial success in clinical dermatology and dentistry. This proposal will build a prototype system and test it on several types of animal tissue.

    Research (SBIR) project entails alleviation of a human eye condition that has
    obscured the scientific community for almost a century. Refractive eye error is
    the most pervasive condition affecting the ocular health of the U.S. population,
    across all ethnicities. Presbyopia, a widespread form of such refractive error,
    affects 125 million Americans, and over 1.8 billion people worldwide today. It
    is caused by reduction of focusing and re-focusing ability of the human eye lens
    with natural aging. The symptoms range from blurred vision, haziness, and eye
    strain to headaches, which are sometimes severe enough to affect the quality of
    life and work ability of subjects. Since the early 1900s, presbyopia has been
    traditionally treated with fixed power multi-focal and progressive eyeglasses
    that do not solve the core problem of age-related loss of accommodative ability.
    The principal goal of this SBIR work is development of key high performance tunable
    Smart Eyeglasses with good stability and restoration algorithms that will help
    restore this lost ability. This 21st century device, the world?s first smart auto-focus
    eyewear, will offer personalized full field normal vision restoration to presbyopic
    subjects and generate jobs and revenues worth billions of dollars. \n\nThis SBIR
    Phase I project proposes to implement the feasibility of commercialization of
    21st Century variable power smart eyeglasses that will restore the natural accommodation
    of human eye that is lost to presbyopia due to aging. These adaptive glasses use
    a combination of fluidic lenses with variable power, ultra-light actuators, distance
    sensors, and embedded control electronics to continually produce full-field sharply
    focused view for objects at variable distances. For this proposal, we focus on
    the research and development of two important aspects of these devices which are
    key to a successful commercialization. First, is improving the long-term stability
    of the viscoelastic membranes of these adaptive glasses by using low drift materials
    instead of PDMS, and secondly, incorporating a closed-loop feedback mechanism
    using displacement sensors to account for the correction of drifts resulting from
    the hysteresis and degradation of lens-driving piezo actuators. In the first task,
    our goal is to achieve an optical power drift of less than 120 milli-Diopter/year,
    and in the second task, achieve a drift less than 83 milli-Diopter/year. These
    milestones will result in a lens with drift that is less than 0.25 Diopter over
    its expected 3 year lifetime, critical for a commercial grade eyewear lens.\n\nThis

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project extends from years of research into the impact of Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs), and yet there is still no direct, field assay for toxic cells. The identification of HABs is critical to determine their patterns of occurrence, to protect water and food supplies, and to alert the general public when there is a problem. Harmful Algal Blooms are a world-wide fresh water, brackish water and marine phenomena that occur in every coastal and inland country and annually cause significant economic damage and take human lives. The detection of HABs and their toxins is currently completed by complex, expensive, and time consuming microscopic analyses that do not necessarily provide the critical and timely information that water quality mangers require. Raman spectroscopy provides a strong and distinct fingerprint of HAB cells and their toxins without the need for sample preparation, and can be used on-site at beaches, drinking water reservoirs, or within distributed networks of Raman sensors all communicating through the cloud to provide managers immediate and spatially distinct information on the presence and concentration of potentially toxic cells.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to develop and market an in-situ 3D microscope with on-axis Raman spectroscopy to provide both morphological information and a chemical signature for identification of HAB cells to species, and in some cases specific strains, along with the presence and concentration of toxin on a per cell basis. The novel technical specifications include: 1) the use of Light Field (LF) microscopy to maximize the depth of field to allow for detection of low cell concentrations (< 1 cell/ mL). LF microscopy also provides a 3D image for more complete and accurate morphological assessment of cells and particulates, 2) Advanced software for color and texture feature extraction and classification of cells using Gabor wavelets and a novel color angle feature, which provide 100% classification accuracy in many cases, 3) the use of Resonance Micro-Raman Spectroscopy (RMRS) to collect spectral fingerprints on the inorganic and organic content of cells, particulates and dissolved compounds, and 4) the integration of these technologies into sensor packages as part of the IoT cloud computing thrust that is sure to gain traction over the next few years, and will provide regional protection of both large and small drinking water reservoirs, globally.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this STTR project stems
    from the costs to U.S. food producers of outbreaks of animal diseases.  Producers
    of poultry, pork, and other food proteins lose more than $1B each year to infectious
    diseases, including some that are transmitted through the air.  For diseases having
    an airborne transmission route, protective technologies that are available are
    few and can be costly to implement and operate.  This project furthers the development
    of a new alternative technology, non-thermal plasmas, for the simultaneous removal
    and inactivation in air of the organisms responsible for the transmission of disease
    to livestock.  This project evaluates how conditions in the environment typically
    found near livestock affect the performance of non-thermal plasmas.  This project
    also pursues a technique for accelerating the process of improving non-thermal
    plasma performance, upon the completion of which new and improved non-thermal
    plasma devices can be developed for applications such as this more rapidly than
    is possible now.  Completion of the project will enable the development of lower-cost
    protective technologies for maintaining livestock health, making such technologies
    economically accessible to a larger segment of food protein producers, ultimately
    lowering food costs and increasing domestic food security.  \n\nThis STTR Phase
    I project proposes to experimentally demonstrate and evaluate the effectiveness
    of a non-thermal plasma (NTP) as a means of preventing disease-carrying particles
    in outside air from infecting livestock housed in animal confinement buildings.
    \  NTPs are stable electrical discharges that simultaneously contribute to the
    removal of airborne particles while also subjecting them to chemical attack capable
    of killing harmful viruses.  While NTPs have been demonstrated for disinfection
    of fixed surfaces, and to a lesser degree for the destruction of chemical contaminants
    or biological pathogens in air, the intellectual merit of this project stems from
    its evaluation of trace gases commonly present in the air around livestock, ammonia
    and hydrogen sulfide, and their potential to both enhance and diminish the performance
    of NTPs used in farm environments.   Additionally, this project will identify
    non-biological tracers suitable for use in NTP optimization testing which will
    accelerate the development of improved designs.  Two separate lab-scale NTP reactors
    will be used in the execution of the project.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is that it provides unique secure, tamper resistant record keeping and logging services that leverage blockchain technology for a wide range of IoT applications. The solution will provide significant benefits in terms of performance, cost (e.g., total ownership cost), cyber attack resilience, security and privacy assurance for both IoT device owners, operators, and industries utilizing IoT technology such as transportation, smart city, logistics, supply chain management, manufacture, energy, critical infrastructures.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to develop a scalable auditing, record keeping, and logging system for internal/external operations and data interactions of IoT devices, which are fundamental components to support other critical properties and operations of IoT enabled infrastructures. The record keeping and logging system solves several critical challenges in distributed IoT environment: transaction ordering and data distribution. In addition, the logging and transactional system can be the centric component for producer-consumer style applications.

    The broader impact/commercialization potential of this project is to address the need for a small, low-cost, and high-accuracy angular rate and angular orientation sensor (also known as a gyroscope) for a wide range of applications.  Gyroscopes are desired by many emerging applications such as inertial measurement units for small satellites such as CubeSats, autonomous vehicles, drones, and high-end wearable electronics.  These applications require a gyroscope with a similar price (< $10) but ~10,000 times better accuracy than those currently used in smartphones.  The birdbath resonator gyroscope (BRG) is a novel micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) gyroscope with a strong potential to satisfy the needs of these applications due to significantly better resonance quality and mechanical symmetry than current silicon gyroscopes.  The economic impact of BRGs will be enormous since many industries can utilize high-performance gyroscopes to monitor the dynamics of their systems, provide positional awareness, and improve the performance of other parts of these systems.  Availability of low-cost and high-performance gyroscopes will enable users to further understand their applications and explore their limits and applicability across a broad range of societal needs.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a new batch-level microfabrication technology to enable the commercialization of low-cost, very high-performance MEMS gyroscope from fused-silica.  Gyroscopes available today are either accurate but large and expensive (example: hemispherical resonator gyroscope), or small and cheap but inaccurate (example: smartphone gyroscopes).  High-accuracy silicon MEMS gyroscopes in research are small and accurate but expensive.  This is because silicon has fundamentally low mechanical resonance quality factor (Q) so it is difficult to manufacture high-accuracy gyroscopes with a high yield.  The BRG is a gyroscope made from fused-silica and capable of having low cost, small size, and high performance.  Its fused silica micro mechanical resonator can achieve significantly higher Q than silicon, which allows the BRG to be manufactured with a high yield.  The BRG fabrication process uses a blowtorch to reflow-mold a fused silica substrate into three-dimensional hollow shells with dimensions of several 10s of micrometers to several millimeters with high geometrical accuracy.  The proposed research will significantly enhance our understanding of the relationships among size, design, and process on the performance of the BRG as well as the relationship among detailed process parameters, yield and reproducibility on cost.

    Broader Impacts: The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project include improving food security, while at the same time enhancing the economic viability and environmental sustainability of large-scale production agriculture. In order to improve crop varieties, agricultural production, and sustainability of farming, there is an urgent need for better technologies to acquire under-canopy plant trait and health data. Examples of high-value under-canopy data include emergence, stem width, corn ear height, plant life-cycle events like flowering and fruiting, and symptoms of pathogens, diseases, and nutrient deficiency. Because these data cannot be obtained by aerial imaging, under-canopy data collection has dramatically greater actionability and value compared to aerial data. However no cost-effective, scalable ways of collecting this data are currently available. In fact, the state of the art is manual data collection by crop scientists (and their students or interns), agronomists, crop-scouts or farmers - an extremely labor intensive, and therefore expensive way of collecting this highly valuable data. Our work will greatly enhance the availability of under-canopy data from field crops. The commercial value of the field data for crop breeding is in excess of $50 Million/year for breeding major row-crops in the US.

    Intellectual Merits: This SBIR Phase I project will demonstrate the technical feasibility of autonomously collecting under-canopy data from field crops using TerraSentia, our low-cost ground robot. In preliminary work, we have built the robot hardware, demonstrated its ability to collect high-value plant data from row-crop fields, and analyze it to generate plant-trait information. In the proposed work, we will enable and demonstrate the ability of TerraSentia to collect data autonomously throughout the season. We will demonstrate the technical feasibility of fusing information from low-cost LIDAR, GPS, and vision. We will also demonstrate the feasibility using real-time control algorithms to adapt camera perspective and robot path in order to obtain the highest quality information from the complex and dynamic under- canopy field environments. These high-risk innovations will together enable long-term deployment of TerraSentia for effective data collection and phenotyping, benefiting crop scientists and agricultural product development professionals.

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase I project will develop a very long-acting buprenorphine
    formulation to increase patient compliance and address the opioid crisis. Poor
    medication compliance is a significant driver of health care costs. The US would
    save an estimated 290 billion dollars yearly or 13% of the total health care budget
    if patients took their medications as directed. Patients with chronic diseases
    are the least compliant with medication. There is an evolving consensus that Opioid
    Misuse Disorder (OMD) is also a chronic disease, and its treatment is also plagued
    by poor compliance. There are an estimated 2.5 million people in the United States
    with OMD. Complete abstinence therapy fails about 80% of the time. Medication-assisted
    therapy using methadone, naltrexone or buprenorphine is far more successful. More
    opioid misuse patients are treated with buprenorphine than methadone, and retention
    in treatment is up to 78% with additional counseling. Still, 80% of all people
    who misuse opioids never obtain any therapy for their disorder, risking overdose,
    other diseases, including HIV and Hepatitis, and amyloidosis. Extended-release
    medications for opioid maintenance therapy would open up more options to get people
    into therapy. A 3-month release formulation of buprenorphine would be a part of
    that strategy.  \n\nBuprenorphine is a partial agonist opioid drug that is used
    for treatment of pain in human and animal patients and for opioid addiction maintenance.
    A platform technology has been developed that can be used to formulate extended-release
    preparations of drugs that are weak bases and are mildly lipophilic. Preparations
    of buprenorphine, naltrexone and doxycycline have been developed using this method.
    The initial proposed product is an injectable formulation of buprenorphine that
    releases over a period of 3 months. This project will address the occurrence of
    a brief peak of early drug release in the 3-month duration buprenorphine formulation.
    The experiments in the current proposal will examine three different methods of
    decreasing the early peak by manipulating the amount of lipid engulfed by macrophages
    at a given dose of drug or by preventing macrophage engulfment of the lipid particles
    entirely by coating the lipid particles with chemicals that make them unlikely
    to be phagocytized. Preliminary results indicate that changing the drug to lipid
    ratio as described in the current proposal will reduce the peak of early release.
    Reducing the early peak will prevent sedative effects, improve the pharmacokinetics
    of the preparation and make dose escalation studies easier and more straight forward.\n\nThis

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to enable accurate electronic health record (EHR)-based studies to support precision medicine. The country is embarking on a journey of using real world evidence (RWE) to adjust the existing standard of care. EHR-based subgroup analytics and comparative effectiveness studies will increasingly be used to augment regulatory and reimbursement approval. These efforts require accurately recognizing clinical outcomes in real world scenarios. Studies attempting to identify real world outcomes, such as pain and disease free survival, have shown low accuracy rates in claims and EHR discrete data. This proposal aims to accurately detect challenging outcomes from EHR data using advanced semantic technologies. The goal is to enable accurate RWE studies to achieve safer and more effective use of RWE in clinical practice.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to create an application to extract clinical outcomes from real world data to enable EHR-based pragmatic clinical trials (PCTs). The approach uses natural language processing (NLP) to dive deep into the health record for exposure, intervention, and outcome data that do not exist or are inaccurate in claims and EHR discrete data. Project objectives include extracting features from clinical data using NLP and ontologic mapping, developing a knowledge database that reflects common outcomes in observational and clinical trials, and inferring outcome from extracted features using clinical data. The project will validate the outcome detection engine using de-identified longitudinal clinical data to assess accuracy of feature extraction and inferred outcome.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is a system that provides improved reservoir productivity through a novel, inexpensive, and environmentally friendly method. This method will use an electric impulse to increase reservoir permeability, and decrease industry reliance on alternative methods like hydraulic fracturing, which requires hazardous chemicals to be pumped into the subsurface. Residents in regions where fracking techniques are utilized have commonly been impacted by induced seismicity and landslides as a consequence of pumped in chemicals lubricating faults, making earth ruptures more likely to occur. Additionally, the material and operation time for reservoir stimulation techniques makes the current process expensive. The ability to increase permeability with an electric impulse will avoid the environmental concerns associated with current methods, and will proved a cost competitive reservoir stimulation solution due to a short operational time.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a novel low-frequency impulse method (LFIM) that increases reservoir permeability for petroleum and geothermal applications, without requiring pumping of material into the subsurface. Fluid mobility is increased due to viscosity reduction and reservoir permeability is increased in the direction of interest from the vibrational removal of particles within sediment pores.  This program will 1) simulate the processes taking place in the reservoir using computer simulation model, 2) perform experimental analysis of the effects of the electric treatment on different core samples, and 3) determine applicability of the method to different types of the reservoirs located in the United States.  Therefore, this project will identify the optimum sites, where LFIM can boost geothermal performance and oil & gas production.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project scales the production of renewable monomers that give access to performance nylon polyamides with tailorable functional properties for applications in the automotive, food & beverage packaging, textiles, and other industries. The revolutionary technology will be a disruptive force to the $40 billion nylon polyamide industry by addressing nylon?s weaknesses such as undesired moisture adsorption, which results in loss of dimensional stability and tensile strength. These shortcomings lead industries to make compromises in selecting their materials; for instance, longer chain polyamides are used for moisture resistance but at the expense of desired viscoelastic properties. The proposed bio-advantaged monomers will 1) help ease reliance on petroleum-based chemicals resulting in greener production processes and a cleaner environment, 2) present new opportunities for innovation and use of performance plastics due to the platform that bio-advantaged monomers offer. This is expected to generate new jobs at multiple points in the value chain. Demand for agricultural goods by fermentation facilities will increase. Sumatra Biorenewables and its partners will create jobs to meet demand for monomer production and purification. Finally, polymer producers and the manufacturing industry will produce superior products, increasing the competitiveness of the U.S. chemical industry.

    The intellectual merit of this project is to combine fermentation and chemical conversion for the production of bio-advantaged monomers and their corresponding performance-enhanced polyamides. The inexpensive, robust, and efficient monomer production process in conjunction with the customizable nature of bio-advantaged monomers to yield nylon derivatives that are hydrophobic, flame retardant, anti-static, or otherwise tailorable, afford opportunities to meet a number of needs in the manufacturing sector. The innovation?s success hinges on a monomer production process that utilizes an inexpensive electrochemical conversion that operates near 100% efficiency and that only uses water as a reactant and electricity as an energy source. In addition, the monomer production process is insensitive to the feedstock source and the impurities present in fermentation broths. Therefore, separation and purification is only required after monomer production, resulting in huge cost savings. Laboratory-tested samples of hydrophobic nylon perform equally well as dry nylon, but without the disadvantage of moisture sensitivity. This project will enable Sumatra Biorenewables to transition to a continuous flow, kilogram-scale, production process and supply potential customers with samples for performance testing.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) project is the development of an artificial intelligence-based
    software platform to elucidate inherited diseases by identifying the causative
    genetic factors in the whole genome at large, not just the tiny portion of the
    genome called the exome. This technology will help solve the longstanding problems
    of multigenic inherited diseases and help unlock the full potential of gene therapy
    modalities such as CRISPR, which require knowledge of the causal mutation for
    targeting. With a defined genetic target, truly curative therapeutics and early,
    accurate diagnostics will be made possible. Through this platform, pharmaceutical
    companies will benefit from a shortened drug development cycle and a lower risk
    of clinical trial failure while diagnostics companies will be able to develop
    fast and accurate molecular diagnostics targeting the mutations identified by
    the platform. \n\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes to build a build a proof-of-concept
    software platform that employs a combination of supervised and unsupervised machine
    learning algorithms to process, sort, and analyze human whole genome sequencing
    data from an Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) cohort from a set genetic background.
    ALS is an incurable, debilitating disease whose genetic causes remain largely
    unknown. Identifying these mutations will enable the development of efficacious
    treatments for the conditions. Three main objectives will be accomplished for
    the platform. One, the ability to process full-size, high coverage human whole
    genome data automatically through the pipeline in a scalable manner. Two, the
    ability to identify the genetic background of a test subject with a top-5 error
    rate of <1%, an important verification step to minimize incorrect cohort stratification
    from false ancestry self-reports. Three, the ability to rapidly identify at least
    one genetic feature known to be associated with ALS (e.g., SOD1, C9ORF72), which
    will help provide early validation for the platform.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's

    on developing a  plasma jet printing technology to serve the printed electronics
    industry. Printed electronic devices including flexible electronics and flexible
    hybrid electronics (FHE) are next generation smart devices that have applications
    in both consumer and industrial segments. These devices combine the flexibility
    and low cost of printed substrates made of plastic with the performance of semiconductor
    devices to create a new category of electronics. The main challenge in FHE is
    integration of semiconductor die to the flexible substrate and interconnects.
    Plasma jet printing has high potential to address the problems associated with
    printed electronics manufacturing, in particular the interconnects. The plasma
    process control allows printing metallic materials with required electronic properties
    by in-situ treatment, thereby eliminating the need for post processing. The global
    market for printed electronics equipment is $1.5 billion in 2017 and is estimated
    to reach $4 billion globally in 2020 and growing at a compound annual growth rate
    of 38%. Immediate industrial application of our technology is in replacing wire
    bonding with direct write printing of metallic interconnects for flexible hybrid
    electronics. \n\n\nThe intellectual merit of this project is in developing a plasma
    jet print head hardware for direct write printing of conducting metallic interconnects
    with reduced process steps.  The project focus will be on technological de-risking
    of the print head hardware and process de-risking for reliable and re-producible
    printing. Developing the plasma process that can be used for pre-treatment of
    substrate, in-situ treatment of nanoparticles, printing and post processing all
    in one tool and simultaneously can reduce the process steps, number of equipments
    needed and time taken for manufacturing. Oxidation of metal nanoparticle ink and
    its limited shelf life is currently being addressed by polymer capping of the
    nanoparticles and thermal/laser processing. Developing a plasma process that can
    be used to print high quality conducting patterns using in-situ treatment can
    take the technology closer to adoption by printed electronics industry. The anticipated
    outcome of this project is a robust plasma jet print head and a process that can
    reliably and reproducibly print conducting metal films with tailored oxidation
    state and electronic structure.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission

    the commercial viability of using new non-precious metal catalysts to produce
    hydrogen by splitting water.  Electrolyzers made with these new catalysts have
    the potential to deliver higher efficiencies and lower capital costs than currently
    available systems. The market for hydrogen today is $115 billion per year.  Currently,
    hydrogen is primarily produced via steam reformation of methane. Hydrogen production
    via steam reformation emits millions of tons of CO2 into the atmosphere annually.
    There is broad agreement that water electrolysis can play a significant role in
    future hydrogen production if cost reductions can be realized.  In addition, hydrogen
    has the potential to store energy produced by renewable energy systems like solar
    and wind and make it available on demand. The initial market entry point for these
    new electrolyzers is to supply hydrogen for fuel cell powered forklifts used in
    material handling. A life cycle cost analysis by the National Renewable Energy
    Laboratory (NREL) has shown that the total life cycle costs of hydrogen fuel cell
    forklifts are 10% cheaper than those using lead acid batteries. \n\nThe intellectual
    merit of this project is focused on the ability of new earth-abundant non-precious
    metal catalysts for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution
    reaction (OER) to dramatically lower costs while improving efficiency in water
    splitting. The HER electrocatalyst is composed of hyper-thin FeS2 nano-discs and
    the OER electrocatalyst is nanoamorphous Ni0.8:Fe0.2 oxide. The preferred operating
    pH for the catalysts are different (pH 7 for the hyper-thin FeS2 nano-discs and
    pH 14 for the nanoamorphous Ni0.8:Fe0.2 oxide). Preliminary data shows that these
    two catalysts with the dual-pH membrane can effectively split water with a total
    overpotential of only 300 mV (1.53 V in a two electrode configuration). This is
    more than 50 mV lower than the best-known precious metal catalysts, Pt and IrOx,
    used in current commercial electrolyzers. The project will continue the optimization
    of these catalysts in the dual-pH electrolyzer stack and also determine if stability
    and lifetime meet commercial requirements\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory

    This SBIR Phase I project takes a deeper look at the concept of 'purpose' and its relationship to the marketplace, unemployment, and start-up incubators. It intends to develop a multi-question self-assessment tool to help individuals find meaningful purpose through free, online, live and self-paced hybrid course instruction. The coursework will use augmented reality and 3-D video to motivate individuals to re-think purpose as a central motivation to employment and entrepreneurship. This project aligns with the NSF?s mission to advance national health, prosperity, and welfare with science and technology. These outcomes could potentially generate a new generation of business owners that are dedicated to meaning and money through a double bottom-line approach to entrepreneurship.

    This project combines the educational work of finding purpose through self- help and the technology of 3-D video and augmented reality for the first time. This unique project provides free online live synchronous education combined with hybrid self-paced online course work to help individuals find meaningful self-employment solutions. This project utilizes a proprietary training method designed to quickly help individuals find their purpose in life and invent a useful business or nonprofit to solve problems in the world. This research can help students re-center their motivations to chart a meaningful life course through a business or nonprofit start-up. The curriculum starts with this activity and extends to provide students an opportunity to enter the marketplace through micro-enterprise or nonprofit creation. The courses will utilize predictive analytics to synthesize student data (such as the answers each student inputs for the four questions in the purpose activity). The data will be reorganized and automated into a clear and targeted purpose proposition statement for the student.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research
    (SBIR) project is significant as it offers a disruptive new mechanical approach to stroke
    treatment. Each year, 795,000 strokes occur in the U.S., 1.7 million strokes in Europe, and
    nearly 20.5 million strokes worldwide. This public-private partnership is expected to have an
    important positive societal impact on the community by saving lives especially the elderly and
    decreasing the economic burden of stroke on the taxpayer. This life-saving device has a unique
    value proposition for health-systems with lower inventory costs from a single size device, and
    for patients with better vessel re-opening rates, thereby saving brain cells. This textile-based
    braided retrievable stent, also known as an embolus retriever or thrombectomy-assist device is
    an innovation that will enhance scientific and technological understanding of how personalized
    medicine can transform the care of stroke patients in the U.S. and worldwide.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to bring to market the industry?s longest blood clot
    or embolus retriever for removal of short and long clots that can be customized by the operator
    based on each patient?s clot burden. In addition, it is the first textile-based braided retrievable
    stent which works well in conjunction with standard catheter-based aspiration systems for stroke
    treatment developed in the U.S. that can be personalized to all clot lengths. Stroke is a major
    problem causing 5.5 million deaths worldwide and currently there is no cost-effective and
    efficacious treatments. The mean lifetime healthcare cost per stroke patient is $140,048. This
    textile-based clot retrieval device (aka thrombectomy-assist device) is a cost-effective medical
    device that can help save a stroke patient?s life. The methods and approaches of this project is
    to compare via pre-clinical tests the ability of a textile-based medical device to re-open vessels
    blocked with clots compared with existing approved treatments. The goals and scope of the
    research will focus on the ability to rapidly re-open vessels that are blocked by clots. This paves
    the way for personalized medicine with a customizable stroke treatment device that can be
    tailored to a patient?s clot burden.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is the reuse of rubber compounds from spent tires in high performance products including new tires without significant loss in product performance. Only a very small portion of those tires are currently being ground up for this purpose because of the detrimental impact  on product properties. However, larger quantities could potentially be used if the ground rubber is treated by the process of our invention. This would have several benefits.  Manufacturers could reduce material cost, the rubber recycling industry would enjoy significant growth and unsightly tire dumps with associated pollution problems would disappear. Additionally, the tire industry will become more sustainable and other unacceptable uses of old tires currently practiced, such as their use as fuels in low cost operations, would be financially challenged as novel, more profitable uses that retain the integrity of the polymer matrix emerge.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to build upon studies conducted by our company during the last few years. While it was widely known that recycled ground rubber will significantly reduce physical properties, limited information and understanding existed on the basic causes. Much hope was pinned by many companies and academic institutions on the potential merit of the ground up rubber but no significant commercial process previously emerged. This work aims to develop a recycling process which does not require a devulcanization step. This was first demonstrated with model sample geometries that simulate the environment which ground rubber particles experience when added to and being co-vulcanized with fresh rubber compounds.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I is the improvement of public transportation services for people with disabilities, specifically people with visual impairments. Individuals with visual impairments are heavily dependent on public transit as an essential service for engaging in daily life and social activities. However, they often face challenges with (1) determining which bus to board, especially at busy bus stops when multiple buses approach, and (2) boarding the correct bus in a timely fashion before they leave the stop. By developing an advanced notification service for alerting bus drivers, SeeingBus will address the societal and market needs to mitigate these challenges and thereby promote independent use of public transportation among people with visual impairments. Improving accessibility of public transportation to people with disabilities along with enhancing perception of their service will boost ridership resulting in increased revenue for agencies. The project will contribute to the scientific community as well as society in general by advancing understanding of Smart City services needed for independent travel of people with disabilities.

    The proposed project will develop and commercialize a Smart City service to improve public transportation for people with visual impairments. The service, SeeingBus, provides an advanced notification to bus drivers about users waiting at their next stop. People with visual impairments often miss buses due to challenges they face with boarding the correct bus. SeeingBus aims to improve accessibility of public transportation by engaging bus drivers even before the bus arrives at the stop where riders with visual impairments are waiting. As part of the smart city vision, SeeingBus will enhance connectivity of public transportation systems through greater communication between riders, bus stops, and bus drivers by means of smart sensors. Using big data, SeeingBus alerts bus drivers about users with disabilities, so the drivers can assist individuals in boarding the bus safely. The research objective of this project is to develop and test the feasibility of the SeeingBus system. Advancing public transportation, essential to promoting the travel and independence of individuals, aligns with the NSF mission to advance prosperity and welfare through scientific advancements.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop customizable cell/tissue culture platforms using a new class of 3D printable bisphenol A-free polycarbonate (BFP) materials and a rapid 3D printing system. The 3D cell culture market was valued at $683 million in 2017 with an exponential projected growth in revenue valued at $1.7 billion by 2022. The rapid growth in this sector is primarily driven by the demand for custom-made 3D cell/tissue models that more accurately recapitulate the human in vivo biology in comparison to conventional animal models and planar cell culture systems. 3D cell/tissue models have the potential to provide more physiologically relevant responses for the drug discovery industry which is estimated to reach $86 billion in 2022. The proposed strategy of using BFP and a fully integrated benchtop 3D printing system will facilitate the production of different cell/tissue culture platforms on demand and enable rapid iteration of different designs to drive forward the development of more clinically relevant cell/tissue models for a broad market in pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, and biological studies.

    The intellectual merit of this project lies in: (1) the development of novel 3D printable BFP materials with tunable material properties using green chemistry, and (2) the rapid 3D printing of customizable cell/tissue culture prototypes to support various 3D cell/tissue models. The material development will include the establishment of a reagent library and optimization of the green chemistry process. The relevant material properties such as stiffness, elasticity, optical transparency, and small molecule adsorption will be characterized and optimized. These materials will then be printed using a rapid light-based 3D printer to prototype cell/tissue culture platforms followed by evaluation of their performance. In particular, 3D printing precision and resolution will be characterized and optimized by varying a range of fabrication parameters such as light exposure time and intensity. Next, the efficacy of the prototypes under cell culture conditions will be assessed based on device integrity, material degradation, as well as changes in mechanical and optical properties. Various cells/tissues will also be cultured on these prototype devices to evaluate biocompatibility. These achievements will provide customized culture platforms to facilitate the engineering of more physiologically relevant in vitro models for accelerating drug discovery and biological studies in both industry and academia.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is the commercialization of a fermentation bioprocess that can bring significant benefits for the dairy industry - called the WheyAway system. By initially addressing the problem of handling acid whey, a waste stream generated by all Greek yogurt and cottage cheese producers - the WheyAway can convert the cost of waste handling into a revenue by producing valuable bio-oil platform chemicals. The WheyAway can economically convert the acid whey waste stream to bio-oil on-site, allowing our customers to effectively install biorefineries at each of their plants. In comparison to anaerobic digestion, the WheyAway system can provide several multiples greater economic value. These bio-oils can be used as biofuel feedstocks, animal feed additives, and specialty chemicals. Converting acid whey yields a significant market opportunity with projected impact that could simultaneously offset ~435,000 gallons of diesel used to truck this waste off-site and eliminate ~18,000 tons of greenhouse gases from being emitted to the atmosphere. In the future, this bioprocess can be tuned to address other dairy processing streams, allowing the WheyAway to provide value to stakeholders across the entire dairy production value chain.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to scale-up and optimize a novel fermentation bioprocess called the WheyAway system, and can economically convert acid whey waste into valuable platform chemicals, to provide value to Greek yogurt and cottage cheese producers. Plan is to scale to maximize bio-oil production and conversion efficiency through system optimization. A key focus will be to lower the capital cost for the extraction process. Through the tasks proposed for this SBIR, objectives to scale to a 5x larger reactor, lower operating expense by 20%, and lower the capital cost of the currently expensive bio-oil extraction process by 10x. Additionally, potential to convert other dairy process streams, such as sweet whey, will be evaluated, which could unlock larger opportunities in the dairy production value chain.

    This SBIR Phase I project will develop text, speech and image analysis technologies to transform a set of educational lecture videos into an interactive learning companion. A lecture video will be presented as a series of topically cohesive sections, each represented by a textual summary, a visual summary, and a video segment. Students will be able to query a series of lecture videos with the answers presented as a combination of text, images, speech with transcript, and video, along with links to additional relevant resources. These technological enhancements will drive the development of the lecture video management system with capabilities well beyond commercial state of the art. The students will gain the ability to instantly access any information in a semester long course, with little overhead for the instructor. The business plan focuses on a freemium model designed for wide adoption with no cost to instructors and a very low cost to students. The ultimate potential societal benefit is a significantly better learning experience and learning outcomes for higher education students.


    The key innovations in this project are summarization of video segments and a Questions & Answers (QA) system customized for a series of lecture videos. These are formidable challenges despite existing substantial related research in text mining and image analysis. The information content of a lecture video spans multiple modalities, specifically, screen text, images, and speech. Further, each modality has unique characteristics. Screen text is typically unstructured and includes Optical Character Recognition errors. Transcripts from classroom lecture videos contain informal classroom interactions and suffer from speech recognition errors. The images in a lecture video can represent a variety of concepts including illustrative examples, graphs and charts, and camera images. Innovative approaches to topic modeling will be developed to handle the unique nature of the input compared to most documents. The project will employ representation learning approaches to map from each modality to a common semantic space that will drive the matching between student questions and the content of lecture videos. Since the best answer to a student question may not be fully contained in a lecture video, external resources including textbooks, message boards, and actual quizzes and exams will also be analyzed to drive the QA module.

Every year there are a few hundred "significant" pipeline accidents (fatalities or significant property damage) causing massive damage to life and property, dispersing hazardous materials and disrupting gas distribution services. These events result in many hundreds of millions of dollars in repair and recovery, and large fines that can be up to a billion dollars or more. This scalable and economical capability will significantly reduce the likelihood of such failures, without requiring additional infrastructure. Performance has been validated at a large utility company, and the prototype has demonstrated the ability to capture a substantial fraction of previously undetected events with significant advance warning (90 minutes or more). This outcome represents a clear performance improvement over existing systems and is enabled by advanced models customized for the gas-utility domain. The methods developed in this project can be directly applied to improve detection accuracy in other contexts such as power-grid networks, computer cluster management and financial fraud detection.

     This SBIR Phase I project proposes to detect anomalies in large-scale gas-utility networks through statistical inference from continuously observed time-series data on pressure, prevailing temperature, and other characteristics of the network. Anomalies within gas-utility networks occur due to a variety of reasons, e.g., sulphur or ice buildup in the pipelines, and corrosion/aging of hardware, and are often preceded by detectable signatures in the time-series of gas-pressure data. A premise of the project is that the early detection of such signatures, leading to advance warning of 90 minutes or more, allows corrective action within the utility network to avoid significant property damage, loss of life, and service disruption. The project proposes new methods for the rapid estimation of short and medium timescale models of gas pressure behavior from voluminous streaming data, along with methods for constructing prediction bands through Monte Carlo and stochastic optimization techniques. Such methods are non-generic and their success relies crucially on exploiting specific structural properties that are unique to network-level gas-pressure time series, along with modern trends in statistical machine learning. The proposed stochastic optimization techniques will probabilistically classify identified anomalies into ``failure type," allowing the prioritizing of network level emergency operations.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is that it holds the promise of significantly reducing the over fertilization of crop fields with poultry litter and at the same time provide poultry farmers with greater profits.  Currently poultry litter (excrement, feathers, bedding and other waste) is used as fertilizer on crop fields. The litter is excessively high in phosphorous which is not well adsorbed by crops and ends up in waterways causing excessive algae growth resulting in dead zones with no aquatic life.  This project expects to prove the practicality of a high efficiency burn system that is low enough in cost to be affordable by individual farmers. The system will burn poultry litter and convert the resulting heat energy to electricity and hot water for heating the farmer's chicken houses. The energy savings will increase farmer's net profits (including the amortized cost of the system) by, on average, 25%.  Thus poultry farmers will be incentivized to eliminate environmentally dangerous poultry litter by converting their farm waste to energy.


    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to design, produce and test a scaled prototype version of the lab test system.  The lab test system is expected to provide burn efficiencies as high as ~97% with particulate emissions well within EPA standards. The scaled system will be designed to process ten times the litter as the lab system.  The primary question this SBIR project will answer is: can the lab results be replicated in a full scale system capable of handling the requirements of an average poultry farm.  The patent pending technology upon which the lab system was designed uses computer controlled fuel (poultry litter) feed rates coupled with a multilevel air injection system to produce optimal efficiency. There are several variables that will be tested to ensure upscaling the size will be successful. These include combustion chamber size and design, air injection locations, pressures and CFM, and fuel feed rates.  Successful commercialization will require optimization of these variables in a full scale system.

    Phase I project proposes to expand previous studies that suggested a novel single
    cell protein (SCP) is a significant candidate to serve as a fishmeal alternative.
    In addition, SCP also may contain functional properties that improve growth performance
    and survival. The SCP tested previously supported improved feed conversion ratios

    salmon. Targeted components of the SCP will be enhanced (or deleted) to determine
    the effect of leading immuno-nutritional candidates on the animals' ability to
    digest more completely inputs like soy bean meal (SBM). The effectiveness of SCPs
    in emerging commercial fish diets has yet to be fully elucidated, and the results

    This SBIR Phase I project will study how teachers use data to improve their instruction. In response to widespread understanding that feedback is a necessary component to improvement, school districts are increasingly investing in teacher coaches to provide feedback critical for teachers. However, this is not scalable, and typically only new or underperforming teachers have access to coaching. Earshot seeks to scale and democratize some aspects of coaching so every teacher can have access to the personalized data and feedback necessary for improvement. The goal is for all teachers to maximize their potential, better engaging students in learning.

    Earshot has developed a cloud-based system using voice analysis to provide data about instruction. The core innovation is a machine learning process to listen to dialogue between teachers and students and analyze the quality of the educational exchange. Funding for this project would enable study of two critical questions: How does providing data about teacher behavior affect what teachers do in their classrooms? And, what kinds of resources, content, and support are necessary to help teachers improve? This research has the potential to transform the way teachers use data about their own performance and receive the necessary help to improve.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to further the development of a patent pending technology aimed at producing flexible, lightweight, and low-cost semiconductor substrates. These flexible semiconductor films represent the next evolution of the silicon wafer, the foundation of over 90% of today's electronic devices, including computer chips, solar panels, microelectronics, and a wide range of sensors and similar 'internet of things' devices. The silicon wafer, in its current form, is essentially unchanged since its inception over 60 years ago. These wafers, although larger today, remain thick, rigid, fragile, and are limited to circular forms no larger than 450 millimeters (18 inches) in diameter. The ability to produce large-area, high-throughput quantities of this material, in a flexible, more durable format would be truly disruptive, and help to usher in the next generation of affordable, flexible, and pervasive electronic devices. Accelerating the commercialization of this 'wafer 2.0' will help to shape America's high-tech semiconductor manufacturing industry for the 21st century.

    The proposed project will focus on the development of this innovative technology at a simulated roll-to-roll prototyping scale, to enhance film crystal quality, repeatability, and electronic properties, while preparing the process for integration into large scale manufacturing. To date, no techniques exist that can produce large-area, highly crystalline silicon or other semiconductor films, that are suitable for high-throughput manufacturing. The technique in this proposed work is a novel, patent pending process, suitable for high-throughput roll-to-roll manufacturing and has several technical advantages that favor high-uniformity crystallization. Low-cost, flexible, wafer-like substrates will open the door for a wide range of electronic devices and fully integrated system-on-chip designs, including sensors, displays, lighting, processors, memory, microelectronics, and photovoltaics. Specific research activities will include optimization of the crystallization process via exploration of operating parameters; improvements and refinements to the prototype chamber equipment; evaluation of intermediate thin-film layers to provide ideal electronic properties and to promote more favorable recrystallization; and, finally, characterization of the resulting semiconductor films using state of the art semiconductor tools at the world's largest nanotechnology focused institute.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes increased range, increased efficiency, and decreased size of wireless charging systems, which will provide value to consumer devices (e.g., mobile phones and tablets), transportation, and medical industries. In consumer devices, improved and widely adopted wireless power transfer can lead to more rugged designs of the devices by eliminating charging ports, which are a common mode of device failure. Widely adopted wireless charging can improve convenience for consumers, and, with a unified charging solution across a number of devices, eliminate the need for dedicated, device-specific chargers. Increased charging range will increase the number of use cases in all three industries, leading to greater commercial opportunities for this this technology and wireless power transfer in general. In transportation, high-efficiency wireless charging allows for fast charging that is adaptable to varying vehicle heights, which makes electric vehicles more convenient, increases their rate of adoption, and allows charging that is integrated into infrastructure. Increased efficiency reduces the energy costs associated with charging across all three industries.  Furthermore, this project will enhance the scientific understanding of the power handling capabilities of the multilayer self-resonant structure, and the resonant frequencies achievable with various manufacturing techniques.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project addresses the technical challenges keeping a new wireless power transfer coil technology, called the multilayer self-resonant structure (MSRS), from the market.  In order to commercialize the MSRS, the technology must advance beyond a proof-of-concept, and interface with commercial wireless power transfer systems, specifically those that adhere to existing device standards.  The technical hurdles that need to be addressed include 1) reducing the resonant frequency to meet current standards, 2) understanding the power handling limits, and 3) developing electronic interfaces.  These challenges will be overcome by, respectively,  1) building on existing manufacturing techniques used to handle thin layers of material in other industries and adapting them to  develop a scalable manufacturing approach to construct MSRSs with resonant frequencies in the range needed. 2) Analyzing, measuring, and modeling the power handling capabilities of the MSRS.  Finally, 3) Developing impedance matching circuitry required to interface the MSRS with commercial systems. Successful completion of these task will results in a low cost, high-Q wireless power transfer coil, which can be integrated into commercial systems to increase the capable range, efficiency, and power handling of wireless charging.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be the establishment of the analytical framework and software for a global bathymetry mapping system based upon freely available satellite imagery, three independent extraction methods, and ongoing data collection to create geospatial products for a wide range of applications.? Shallow water zones are crucial to the world?s ecology, economy, and culture.  An estimated 70% of the world?s littoral zone is not mapped to modern standards, and traditional methods of mapping these areas are prohibitively expensive and dangerous. Through remote sensing techniques, this innovation will produce detailed bathymetric data for shallow water areas around the globe at far lower costs than traditional methods. This is particularly significant for impoverished remote, low-lying islands which have scarce resources for mapping the natural environment on which their economies heavily rely. ?Additionally, shallow water bathymetry data is vital to geospatial intelligence and to accurately assessing the feasibility and environmental impact of projects relating to global trade/port development, aquaculture, tourism, and resource development.? The results of this innovation will provide a modern baseline of seabed topography for future scientific analysis, change detection, and greater understanding of the marine environment.

    The proposed project addresses the budgetary and health and safety challenges of nearshore bathymetry mapping by advancing three distinct methods of calculating satellite derived bathymetry. These methods rely on different parameters of measurement for water depth retrieval, enabling the advantages of one method to overcome the shortcomings of another. This will create a self-validating method for leveraging advanced remote sensing algorithms in an integrated software platform with ongoing data collection to produce 10-30m resolution bathymetry elevation models.? Extraction methods utilize underwater stereophotogrammetry from multiple overlapping images, wave kinematic detection from multispectral imagery, and measurement of variable attenuation of multispectral signals through the water column.? Research will be conducted on computer vision applications for assessing and allocating images based upon metocean and atmospheric parameters; seafloor spectral segmentation techniques and effects on subsequent multispectral depth retrieval; automation of stereophotogrammetric seafloor target identification and correlation, and integration and automation of wave kinematic derived depth values with multispectral depth retrieval values.? Statistical analysis of resulting data from this combined processing method, evaluated against in situ data for trial locations, will provide direct comparisons for accuracy reporting, algorithm refinements, computational optimization, and determine overall technical and commercial feasibility of future global implementation.?

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is through providing a sensitive, robust, room temperature operating magnetometer.  Magnetometers are among the most widely used instruments in a variety of applications including healthcare, transportation safety, food contamination monitoring, and homeland security. In fact, the growing need for magnetic field sensors manifests itself in the $1.6 billion global market with a fast-growing medical segment. As for today, the maximum sensitivity is provided by the Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices. The high sensitivity is critically important for medical applications.  However, this high sensitivity can be achieved in the superconducting devices only at cryogenic temperatures.  The proposed magnetometer based on spin wave interferometer combines high sensitivity with room temperature operation. This combination provides a great improvement in healthcare by reducing the cost of equipment, in transportation safety enhancement by providing more accurate traffic control, and in food safety monitoring by detecting small concentrations of heavy metals.  It will be of great benefit to society to have a magnetometer combining the high sensitivity of superconducting devices and room temperature operation.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the need for sensitive and room temperature operating magnetic field sensors by providing a magnetometer based on spin wave interferometer.  There are different types of magnetic sensors available on the market. As of today, the maximum sensitivity up to attoTesla is provided by the Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices. However, this high sensitivity can be achieved only at cryogenic temperatures. The latter makes superconducting magnetometers expensive and limits its practical application. The proposed magnetometer is based on spin wave interference and free of constraints inherent in superconducting devices. The research objectives encompass the development and demonstration of a compact, non-expensive magnetometer with up to attoTesla sensitivity operating in a temperature range from cryogenic to 560 K.  The outcomes of the proposed research will have an impact on commercial, defense and homeland security applications that need increasingly precise and robust magnetic sensors. The development of compact and high-sensitive magnetometer will be relevant to bio-sensing and bio-medical applications as well.

    the quality of life of patients currently suffering from Parkinson?s Disease (PD).
    \ Over 1 million Americans have been diagnosed with PD and this number is expected
    to double by 2040.  PD is a neurodegenerative disorder without a cure ? once the
    first Parkinsonian tremor has been detected, over 80% of the brain cells associated
    with creating dopamine through natural processes have already died. Dopamine is
    a chemical released by neurons to communicate with other nerve cells and is essential
    to enable the basal ganglia network to control the body?s movements. By engaging
    the PD patient with novel, highly-cognitive mobility exercises designed by physical
    therapists (PTs), automaticity can be reprogrammed to utilize different regions
    of the brain to control movement. Ultimately, this rewiring will slow (neuroprotection)
    or possibly reverse the degenerative process.  Although the current technology
    development will focus on this one disease (PD), the technology may be applicable
    to other sister diseases (e.g., Alzheimer?s and Dementia) or even other conditions
    (traumatic brain injury, stroke, concussions, and so on). This computer-adaptive
    platform may eventually enable researchers to identify a biomarker that may lead
    to a cure for this idiopathic condition. \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research
    (SBIR) Phase I project will produce a prototype for an automated physical-therapy
    (PT) treatment for patients suffering from Parkinson?s Disease (PD). This automated
    prototype will act as a virtual coach encouraging patients to perform daily mobility
    exercises in the comfort and privacy of their own homes. This unique, automated
    technology will help rewire the brain of the PD patient by engaging both the mind
    and body which will slow the neurodegeneration inherent to PD. The system will
    automatically adjust the treatment protocol in terms of duration and difficulty
    based on the patient?s unique situation including current medication levels. Objective,
    technology-based outcome measures will be summarized for caregivers working with
    the PD patient (primary care provider, physical therapists, neurologists, and

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is a 25% cost reduction in solar panel manufacturing
    and the elimination of up to 2.1 Gigatons of annual CO2 generation. As silicon
    wafers are the most expensive component in the $50BN solar panel industry, our
    low-cost wafer manufacturing technology presents the strongest opportunity to
    reduce global solar panel production costs. This cost reduction drives the compelling
    economics needed for increasing solar market penetration. As context, the solar
    market has historically doubled for every 20% cost reduction created by the industry.
    Our single crystal wafers are further significantly higher quality, and therefore
    can enable up to 10% higher effective efficiency using existing commercial solar
    panel manufacturing lines. Further, as the incumbent silicon wafer production
    process is extremely energy- and material-intensive and thus constitutes 80% of
    the solar industry?s carbon footprint, our direct and high efficiency technology
    has the potential to reduce the solar industry's 2026 carbon footprint by over
    50%. \n\nThe proposed project develops the systems needed for our process to produce
    silicon wafers with commercial dimensions and demonstrates to solar manufacturers
    (our customers) that our wafers can be processed by commercial solar cell lines.
    As our process produces a continuous ribbon of silicon, this work will develop
    a cutting system that laser cuts discrete wafers with the edges and dimensions
    needed for commercial solar cell processing. This involves developing the laser
    cutting recipes, the wafer handling systems, and verifying with a third party
    that the edge quality does not interfere with cell processing. Our project then
    investigates and optimizes our wafers' performance during each critical step of
    commercial solar cell processing, including chemical etching and screen printing.
    A successful demonstration that our low-cost wafer can 'drop-in' to an existing
    cell line to deliver equivalent (or better) performance compared to the incumbent
    technology would gate our working with industry partners to commercialize this
    process.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy
    of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader

    This Phase I SBIR project will investigate cure-in-place materials for filling and stabilizing open wounds to promote healing. Chronic wounds represent a significant and debilitating burden to patients, affecting more than 6.5 million people in the US alone. The incidence of chronic wounds is expected to rise with increasing rates of obesity and diabetes, but current treatment options show limited clinical efficacy. To address this unmet need, new materials that stimulate the body's healing mechanisms must be developed. This project will evaluate a promising new material that can be applied to a wound as a liquid and cured to a solid in contact with the wound. This cure-in-place process is expected to promote healing by ensuring intimate contact between the pro-healing material and the wound bed, mechanically stabilizing the wound area, and stimulating the body's healing responses. There are few cure-in-place materials in clinical use, so this project will also generate new fundamental engineering knowledge about these materials and their potential applications in human health. The advanced wound care market is currently valued at more than $8 billion, and it is growing. Therefore, innovative technologies in this space represent significant business opportunities that create economic growth.

    This project will investigate a novel cure-in-place process for generating a polysaccharide biomaterial that mimics the mechanical and structural properties of native extracellular matrix to stimulate wound healing. The material is generated by curing two aqueous precursor solutions to form a biodegradable, solid, and hydrated polymer matrix. This project will investigate a cure-in-place process by which the precursor solutions will be applied to the wound as liquids and cured in contact with the wound bed. If the extracellular matrix replacement biomaterial can be cured inside of a wound bed, then its pro-healing effects may be amplified due to its ability to fill an irregularly-shaped wound with complete contact with tissue and its capacity to mechanically stabilize the wound bed and stimulate pro-healing biochemistry. The scope of this effort will include developing an optimized formulation for the cure-in-place precursor solution, determining curing conditions for the biomaterial in contact with tissue, evaluating the material properties of the cure-in-place product, and evaluating cure-in-place application and wound healing efficacy in a porcine excisional wound model.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project covers a myriad of domains including wireless health-care, remote education, supply-chain management, public safety, anti-poverty initiatives, market-places, and entertainment. However, a more immediate work product from this effort is a powerful fully-digital mmWave software defined radio (SDR) platform that will be made available to academic researchers at very affordable rates; this will spur further research and make mmWave testbed experimentation within the reach of lightly-funded academic research groups. The ambitious goal of making this transformative technology the reference design of future mmWave radios represents a massive commercial opportunity which is not limited to the cellular ecosystem (base station, tablets and smartphones), but rather extends to new connected players such as cars, drones, virtual reality (VR) headsets and beyond.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project focuses on the development of millimeter-wave (mmWave) radio technologies for next generation wireless systems. The mmWave frequencies of above 28 GHz are necessary to alleviate the spectrum crunch in the traditional cellular bands, and to make ultra-fast 5th Generation (5G) cellular a reality. However, the uniquely challenging propagation characteristics at these frequencies necessitates the use of transceivers that not only operate over low power budgets, but also deliver the robustness that the cellular ecosystem demands. While existing transceivers allow the radio to look (i.e., transmit or receive) in only one direction or a small number of directions at a time, the proposed transceiver design allows the radio to look in all directions simultaneously. While seemingly simple, this unique ability - combined with a top-down implementation ? will provide enormous benefits to cellular systems at reasonable power budgets. The proposed technology forms the key technological bridge between the theoretical promise of mmWave and actually achieving it in the real world.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the practical deployment of a low-cost and low-power real-time perception system in self-driving consumer cars. This edge computing functionality in sensors enables higher reliability and lower cost of overall sensing and computing needed for truly autonomous self-driving. Such innovation will contribute significantly to the early and widespread availability of safety and convenience benefits to consumers. Furthermore, the advanced perception system will have a potential long-term impact on robotics in general, which can lead to creation of new markets and new lifestyles.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop efficient algorithms and software implementation of a real-time perception system to enable the use of low-cost computing systems for self-driving cars. The algorithms provide a novel way of using image features to perform simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) with 100 times less computational costs than the existing algorithms. They also include a truly novel neural network to fuse the image feature and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) features and perform object detection, which has 100 times less complexity compared to the state-of-the-art method. These reduced-complexity algorithms can be implemented on low-power and low-cost SoC processors.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the ability to sustainably produce more food with fewer water and energy resources. To feed nine billion people on this planet by 2050 we need to develop new systems of agriculture. Indoor agriculture has the potential to transform the way we grow and source our food, enabling locally-sourced crops at higher yields. Food crops can be grown sustainably year-round near all major urban centers if the energy and water consumption of greenhouses could be reduced. This research will lead to the creation of a suite of water management products and services for indoor farming applications thereby making indoor agriculture environmentally sustainable and economically viable.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will commercialize a novel metal organic framework (MOF) material that enables a new class of compact, energy-efficient cooling and dehumidification systems for greenhouses. Recent discoveries at MIT have revealed a novel MOF material with unprecedented water adsorption capacity. Moreover, the MOF material may be readily synthesized from low-cost, bulk commodity chemicals. A dehumidifier operating with this material can harvest waste heat to provide optimal temperature and humidity conditions for controlled environment agriculture. To translate the MOF material from research lab into large scale production, the material must demonstrate sufficient durability under cycling conditions, be designed to afford low cost processing and be integrated into a cost-efficient climate control system that takes advantage of its unique properties. The goal of the proposed R&D is to accelerate durability testing, design a process chemistry to enable low-cost manufacturing and develop system-level models to
    analyze lifecycle performance and cost sensitivity in an indoor farming application.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the creation of flexible passenger identification displays for ride-hailing and automotive applications. This is a distinct pain point as many drivers choose the same model cars. Our first application is to solve ride-hailing passenger identification, but this becomes more critical with autonomous vehicles -- the only method of visual communication between an autonomous car and its target passenger will be via display. By helping to enable autonomous fleets of service vehicles, our displays will impart significant societal benefits, including reduced emissions, improved mobility for the elderly and disabled, and fewer traffic accidents. Beyond automotive, researchers estimate that in 2017 there are 20 billion devices connected to the Internet that are not computers, growing to 125 billion by 2025. These will influence many areas, including health and wellness, factory production, public safety, retail, agriculture, homes, and offices. They will enable better resource allocation, predictive maintenance, operations management, worker training, task automation, energy management, and safety. Not all of these ?Internet of Things? devices need displays, but those that do use them for input and information relay ? the exact uses for which our displays are designed.

    The proposed project will develop roll-to-roll printed passive matrix OLED (PMOLED) display technology. PMOLED displays are built upon a patterned transparent conductive anode that defines the pixels. To date, the only method used in industry to create this anode is photolithography. This is a slow and expensive batch process, but it is the only method that can produce the required results. Our high-resolution printable anode replaces both the incumbent material and the lithographic process to create a continuous roll of plastic covered in OLED anodes that can be loaded into a printing press. This lays the foundation for fully printed displays, fabricated using flexography, the same technique used to print newspapers. Through this work, we will produce fully printed PMOLED display prototypes. These thin, flexible displays will have extremely high contrast while using only 20% of the power required by a backlit LCD, with wide viewing angles for easy readability and flexibility to conform to any surface. If successful, we will be able to print displays 1000 times faster than the industry standard throughput while reducing materials waste by 80%. Such cost savings will make our displays the obvious choice for information display use, especially in design-driven applications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to increase the returns of grain storage for farmers and reduce overall postharvest loss due to toxin and insect damage.  Ten billion bushels, over half of US grains, are stored on-farm each year for 3-12 months.  During this period, grain is susceptible to spoilage, infestation, and moisture loss?all of which impacts the price a farmer receives at the time of market delivery.  There is no easy way to monitor grain quality changes throughout the storage season to optimize for best times to run aeration controls to preserve, condition or maintain the grain.  This leaves farmers with a ?gut check? system of driving to each grain bin site and climbing up and inside units.  Since grain is priced based on moisture baselines, farmers are essentially selling water and weight, their final price outcome can vary significantly based on how well they managed grain conditions throughout the storage period.  In the US, an annual $3 to $ 5 billion dollars (3 ? 5%) of crop value is lost due to toxin, insect and moisture mismanagement that could be prevented through the introduction of affordable and accessible monitoring technology.

    The proposed project would advance internet of things automation and wireless sensor applications as applied to production agriculture and the postharvest supply chain.  There are certain, manual processes of farm production that are strenuous due to time burdens and the lack of obtainable information to make decisions.  Monitoring grain assets, the product of farmers? toil and the safety net of global food supply, in farm bins, commercial storage, and barges is one such process. Sensing for when loss and spoilage risks occur, but more importantly connecting and turning the data into automation opportunities before they exist is the aim of this proposal.  Cable-based monitoring solutions exist, but adoption is restricted due to physical installation limitations, electricity/power constraints, and investment costs.  This project will validate the feasibility of a low-power, wireless sensor that can detect grain conditions and last a full postharvest cycle (18 months).  Such a device will create opportunities to track grain qualities across the agriculture value chain, beginning with its use to monitor and automate farm grain storage.  By characterizing, and testing against cable systems and within grain science 3D models, this project will prove the wireless sensor?s direct functionality within this first farm application.

    This SBIR Phase I project will develop Natural Language Voice-Controlled Lab Assistant technology that enables students to control and interact with hands-on science lab equipment using natural language dialog. The lab assistant technology will connect with science equipment hardware, a mobile or computer app, and cloud-based software for speech recognition and data analysis. A student can perform hands-on experiments, ask questions like "How high did my rocket go?" or "What was the force of the cart collision?", and receive audible responses based on their own experimental measurements. The lab assistant is designed for students that encompass (1) students who are blind or low vision, (2) students with disabilities affecting physical skills, (3) students that would benefit from multi-sensory learning methods as required in Individualized Education Plans (IEPs), and (4) generally students that would benefit from increased engagement in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). The broader impacts of the lab assistant technology will be to promote teaching and learning through professional development of K-12 educators in STEM, and enable broad participation of under-represented groups of people in authentic science inquiry.


    The proposed Lab Assistant will be the first application of state-of-the-art voice recognition technology for educational science experiments. The Lab Assistant will integrate with sensor hardware and mobile apps to enable hands-on experiments in physics, earth science, chemistry, and engineering. The intellectual merits of the Lab Assistant are (1) the development of software that can respond to a wide spectrum of natural language questions and (2) the systems integration of many cutting-edge technologies (wireless sensors, mobile apps, voice recognition software, cloud-based data analysis algorithms) into a simple user interface for science education. The voice interactions will help students overcome disabilities with traditional touch and visual technology, work more independently due to the presence of auditory help, work more effectively in groups, and gain confidence in their STEM abilities. For teachers, the Lab Assistant will provide an "expert in the room" to help guide the hands-on activities that they already do, and provide technical support. The Lab Assistant will be especially useful to teachers without formal science training, that nevertheless need to lead hands-on STEM activities.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will be to develop a preclinical drug characterization platform capable of profiling the effect of a drug candidate on whole protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. PPIs play a pivotal role in most diseases, and are considered high-impact therapeutic targets for cancers, autoimmune diseases, infectious diseases, and more. Over 40 clinically relevant PPIs have been disrupted successfully with small molecules, and several have entered clinical trials. One recently approved cancer drug, Venetoclax, is expected to reach $2.2B in sales by 2020. Despite the enormous clinical and commercial potential of PPI disrupting drugs, preclinical characterization remains a major challenge. Pharmaceutical companies are limited by slow and laborious techniques to measure protein interactions that require each protein to be purified, and each PPI to be measured separately. As a result, only a small subset of relevant interactions are tested during preclinical drug development, which leads to a high incidence of failure during clinical trials. The proposed platform for PPI network characterization is expected to have a major commercial and societal impact by enabling more thorough preclinical screening of PPI inhibiting drugs, reducing the overall cost and time associated with drug development.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop and commercialize a novel platform for screening PPI disrupting drugs that provides quantitative accuracy, enables simultaneous characterization of whole PPI networks, and eliminates the need for protein purification. This platform combines the throughput of a cell-based assay with the accuracy of a bioanalytical technique by linking yeast haploid mating efficiency to the affinity of proteins displayed on the cells' surfaces. Preliminary results demonstrate that next generation sequencing of diploid cells may be used to accurately measure many PPI strengths simultaneously. The goal of this project is to demonstrate that the proposed platform can correctly recapitulate whole disease-relevant PPI networks and accurately characterize well-studied inhibitors in a format that is compatible with existing high-throughput screening workflows. To demonstrate feasibility, the well-studied BCL2 PPI network, which contains unstable proteins and considerable complexity, will be analyzed to identify each pairwise PPI and compared to known interactions from the literature. The yeast strains and assay parameters will then be optimized for screening water insoluble small molecule drugs and 96-well plate compatibility. The ultimate goal of this project is to establish a new platform technology for the preclinical characterization of PPI inhibiting drug candidates.

    impact all these sectors by imparting automation in terms of high-dimensional
    data collection and real-time analytics. \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research
    Phase I project provides a technology leap that furnishes state-of-the-art terrain
    robotics with long-range and real-time situational awareness, including pre-operation
    reconnaissance and post-operation evaluation. A smart docking platform will be
    developed that provides an unlimited energy supply while serving as an ad-hoc
    computing engine and enables the possibility of high-throughput imaging for single
    plants or plant groups.  Such a systematically coupled docking-imaging-computing
    platform is not found to date. The docking will be realized through three independent
    mechanisms, including kinetic sensing and calculation, low-cost stereo vision,
    and radar ranging; and real-time positioning algorithms based on the three mechanisms
    will be developed through a fail-safe data fusion process. The aerial imaging
    drone, charged by the docking platform, can perform two modes of imaging activities
    either towards conventional terrain/field mapping or the novel 4-dimensional (4D)
    reconstruction proposed in this project. The reconstruction algorithms will be
    developed based on the fusion of the stereo data and the hyperspectral data, which
    produces the first-of-its kind 4D spatial-spectral models for high-throughput
    phenotyping.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed
    worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit
    and broader impacts review criteria."

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) project is the development of an effective and sustainable alternative
    to antibiotics and biocides used in animal feed, which will help mitigate the
    global health threat of multidrug-resistant bacteria. The beef cattle industry
    is under increasing regulatory and public pressure to reduce or eliminate the
    use of antibiotic feed additives as they are considered a major factor driving
    the proliferation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. However, in-feed antibiotics
    provide significant economic and animal welfare benefits to the cattle industry
    by reducing the incidence and severity of liver abscesses. This project provides
    an alternative for these conflicting concerns by providing a cost-effective alternative
    to in-feed antibiotics. Further, with sufficient understanding of how the rumen
    microbiome impacts animal physiology and performance, this technology could be
    easily adapted to selectively target microbial species that reduce animal growth
    or feed efficiency, or that produce methane, increasing the economic and environmental
    sustainability of livestock agriculture. \n\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes
    to develop a low-dose, bacteriophage-based feed additive that can be prophylactically
    administered to control the growth of pathogenic Fusobacterium necrophorum in
    cattle rumen. F. necrophorum is a causative agent of liver abscesses in grain-fed
    cattle, and antibiotics are currently added to feed to prevent its growth and
    limit abscess occurrence. However, in-feed antibiotics promote the proliferation
    of antibiotic resistant bacteria, and can cause undesirable off-target effects
    to the rumen microbiome. This research seeks to develop broad host-range (polyvalent)
    bacteriophages as an economical means of controlling cattle pathogens. Polyvalent
    bacteriophages will be isolated using specialized methods that select for those
    with a predetermined host-range based on rumen microbial composition. Each bacteriophage
    will then be characterized and tested for efficacy within a bioreactor operated
    to simulate the cattle rumen. Bacteriophage cocktails will be formulated and tested
    for their ability to minimize the development of bacteriophage resistance. The
    expected outcome of the proposed research is a library of polyvalent bacteriophages
    that can effectively control F. necrophorum under rumen-like conditions, and which
    will be further tested in animal studies.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to develop single cell analysis technology to provide insight into cellular mechanisms, which has the potential to transform drug development and manufacturing. Single-cell analysis, or the ability to decipher cell-to-cell heterogeneity, is a limiting factor in biotechnology and clinical applications. This project aims to further develop a transformative platform technology for integrated single-cell analysis capable of addressing existing challenges with the current state-of-the-art. The platform will potentially shift the paradigm of drug development and manufacturing, enabling quick iteration and evaluation of new therapeutic compounds. This approach could significantly reduce the time and cost to bring new drugs to market and reduce the overall cost of treating patients, which is a substantial benefit to society. Beyond this initial application, this single-cell analysis platform could become a readily implemented research tool, enhancing our basic understanding of biology, facilitate engineering of cell function, as well as evaluating safety and efficacy of new drugs and treatments.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a robust and cost effective commercial prototype technology platform for integrated single-cell analysis. A key feature of the platform technology is the unprecedented sensitivity in measuring quantitatively secreted molecules from single cells. This is achieved by incubating single cells in extremely small volumes, and enabling analytics on an unprecedented scale in these microscopic bioreactors. The proposed work will lead to the development of a consumable prototype microfluidic chip, enabling quick and resource efficient adaptation of the platform to the marketplace. The proposed prototype will be validated through relevant studies, addressing a confirmed market need in cell line development. Commercial adaptation of this prototype will potentially provide deep insight into biological and physiological processes on a single-cell level, and transform drug development and manufacturing, therapeutic treatment, as well as clinical diagnostics.

    Research (SBIR) project is to develop technology to prevent seafood fraud through
    enabling wholesalers, restaurants, and consumers to rapidly identify mislabeled
    fish product outside of controlled laboratory settings. U.S. consumers are subjected
    to mislabeling errors one out of every three times they consume seafood. Species
    that are cheaper and easier to source are commonly swapped for higher value fish
    such as tuna, snapper, and grouper. This substitution occurs at multiple points
    in the supply chain, from producers/processors to wholesalers to restaurants.
    U.S. consumers pay approximately $32 billion for mislabeled seafood on an annual
    basis. Additionally, this seafood may pose a serious health concern or counteract
    regulatory efforts focused on managing vulnerable fish populations and illegal
    fishing. Current seafood identification efforts are insufficient to eradicate
    mislabeling because they require controlled laboratory settings and highly trained
    personnel.  A few portable tests are becoming available but they lack the ability
    to screen large numbers of samples cost-effectively. The platform proposed here
    will enable more widespread seafood identification testing by delivering identification
    within 45 minutes, on-site, and for a lower per sample cost than existing technologies.
    \n\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes to address seafood mislabeling by developing
    a fast and portable DNA-based screening platform to allow for accurate seafood
    identification to address concerns from consumers, retailers, and regulators regarding
    seafood mislabeling.  The key component of the platform to be developed is a nanopore-based
    sensor technology, which is an amplification-free method for direct counting of
    target nucleic acids. It has been demonstrated in preliminary results that the
    technology is able to distinguish grouper DNA from catfish with single-nucleotide
    specificity. This technology also has achieved multiplexed detection, distinguishing
    36 sequences with one sensor. This project will advance this detection assay towards
    a commercial-ready product by expanding the multiplexing strategy to cover 200+
    sequences, designing probes to distinguish 20+ fish species, and then completing
    a full commercial proof-of-principle by identifying seafood species in blinded
    samples in work done on-site.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to enable autonomous vehicles to make risk-aware decisions at high-speed, by reasoning about the uncertain movements of the people and cars around them to anticipate risks and react defensively. This technology will make new technical approaches to safety and risk viable for the first time. It will enable autonomous cars to drive at regular speeds in dense, highly populated urban environments while reducing the likelihood of accidents - thereby resulting in faster, safer urban autonomous driving. This will increase public trust in autonomous cars and accelerate the development of a new industry which could reshape transportation, freeing people from the need to drive their own cars and increasing their free time and productivity.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a specialized processor for risk-aware motion planning for autonomous vehicles. Motion planning is a critical problem for autonomous cars, which must decide how to move through space to reach a designated goal without colliding with a static obstacle, another vehicle, or a pedestrian. Existing approaches can only construct a few plans per second, and assume that the other road-users will continue on their current trajectories. This is acceptable for highways but not for urban driving, where distances are short and other road-users can change behavior suddenly. This project aims to develop a prototype of a specialized motion planning processor that plans in milliseconds, enabling it to consider all likely future movements of other road-users to anticipate risks and react defensively. This proposal aims to evaluate the feasibility of the processor by designing a prototype, demonstrating that it results in safer driving at normal speeds in urban environments, and quantifying its performance improvements over existing solutions.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to provide the capability to affordably and reliably connect underserved or unserved Americans to high speed internet using surface-mounted optical fiber, whether they live in a suburban neighborhood or in a remote rural area. The lack of high speed internet access is largely due to an inability to economically distribute broadband communications over the 'last mile' to businesses, homes, schools, and medical or government entities. An understanding of the installed durability of fiber using this technique will usher in new developments to deploy surface-mounted fiber nationwide. More accessible high-speed internet provides more information, opportunity, and economic productivity regardless of the locale. The digital divide between urban and rural Americans could be reduced or eliminated. Lower cost fiber deployments will make it easier to deploy new technologies, like 5G antennas and connected vehicles, and will shrink the cost to make cities smarter with ubiquitous sensors and cameras.

    The proposed project will demonstrate that optical fibers under protective coatings bonded to paved surfaces can provide reliable high speed communications while subjected to weather and traffic. It will allow estimation of the predicted life time of surface mounted fiber on pavement. The testing will place asphalt samples in an environmental test chamber to evaluate competing fiberoptic installations and to identify the best performers for a series of follow-on field and lab tests. This will allow the future targeting of financial resources on the most promising material and profile combinations. Test samples will undergo wide ranging temperature and humidity cycles and repetitive tire impacts under controlled conditions. This testing will identify statistical life predictions in years after only a few months of actual test time. The longer the predicted life, the larger the customer pool, and the wider the potential market penetration. Understanding the predicted lifetime of a fiber installation will open the door to more early adopters, to more pilot program users, and eventually to fiberoptic installers and long term customers.

    This SBIR Phase I project aims to demonstrate the technical feasibility of a first-of-its-kind injectable gel for treating osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis, a disease of the body's joints, affects greater than 27 million Americans, and the proposed activity will de-risk the proprietary gel technology to warrant continued development of a medical device for treating osteoarthritis. The product is a bioinspired polymer gel solution, to be administered by injection into the joint, which will lubricate, cushion, and protect the joint's cartilage from wear, and thereby slow the progression of osteoarthritis. Upon successful completion of this project, the company aims to complete the preclinical and clinical studies required to gain regulatory approval for the product emanating from the proposed activity. From this project, a deeper fundamental understanding of body-biomaterial interactions will be gained, benefiting engineers, clinicians, and ultimately patients. The anticipated commercial success of this product will result in job creation both before and after completion of product development. As joint pain is one of the leading causes of missed work, disability, and general depreciation of quality of life, successful completion of the proposed high-technical-risk project will lay the foundation for development of an impactful medical device which will treat the highly prevalent disease osteoarthritis.

    The innovation of this project's technology lies in the patented synthetic techniques and composition of a tissue-protective gel solution that remains in the joint capsule at therapeutic concentrations for significantly longer than current injectable gels remain. All injectable viscoelastics approved in the United States for treating osteoarthritis are comprised of hyaluronic acid, a biopolymer which degrades rapidly upon injection; in contrast, the product in this project uses a synthetic, bioinspired polymer which resists degradation and maintains effective viscoelastic properties for four months, whereas current products' viscoelasticity is degraded after one week. The project's first objective will, through a radiolabeled biodistribution study, ascertain the gel's distribution throughout the body following injection into rodent knees, to demonstrate 100% clearance out of the animal and no accumulation within any tissues or organs. The project's second objective will develop the material processing techniques and syringe filling protocol for formulating the gel into its final product form and ensuring product performance and safety specifications are met. Completion of these objectives will allow product to be made under FDA-compliant Design Control for a pivotal large animal study to be conducted following this project, along with completion of formal biocompatibility testing for submission to FDA to seek approval for a First-in-Human clinical trial.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is the development of yeast fermentation technologies that enable conversion of sugars abundant in pectin-rich agricultural waste into useful specialty chemicals. The U.S. is a leading producer of pectin-rich agricultural wastes including citrus peels (>5 million tons annually), sugar beets (>37 million tons annually), and grape pomace (>1 million tons annually). These peel and pulp byproducts lack value, however, the proposed technologies developed in this project will allow for significantly higher valued products to be produced from these waste streams. The initial target chemical product is used as a chelator in cleaning products and a precursor to plastics. Other chemical products potentially may be produced using this platform. Implementation of this fermentation process offers a lower carbon footprint and emissions compared to petroleum or even other sugar-derived products, and has impact in reducing waste and combating climate change. When implemented at scale, these fermentation processing plants will be co-located with rural agricultural processing plants, adding high-tech jobs in these areas, and offering a means to de-risk historically volatile crop harvests by accessing alternative markets.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to engineer yeast strains capable of converting sugars in pectin-rich agricultural wastes into valuable specialty chemicals. Currently, the fermentation rates for utilizing the primary sugar in pectin, D-galacturonic acid, limits production of these chemicals, including the proposed first product, which is a biodegradable metal chelator. Previous characterization has identified that uptake of the pectin sugars by a transporter as the limiting step. Accordingly, the first objective of this proposal is to characterize this class of transporter to identify new transporters with improved rates. The second objective is to improve the best transporter through protein engineering. Using this improved transporter, the final objective will assess the cellular energy requirements for the fermentation process using bioreactors to control fermenter conditions, as product synthesis and transport is energy-demanding. If successful, this project will enable production of specialty chemicals from pectin-rich agricultural waste.

    Research (SBIR) project is in the development of new technologies to manufacture
    personalized therapies for cancer and other diseases that are based on a patient's
    own cells.  Such therapies have shown remarkable success in recent years, however,
    manufacturing these therapies is challenging because mass production techniques
    cannot be employed when each patient receives a unique therapy.  Indeed, for therapies
    based on dendritic cells, which are an important part of the human immune system,
    there are no manufacturing systems currently available that can perform all of
    the required steps.  This project will address this major unmet need by leveraging
    advanced concepts in engineering and biology to design an integrated system for
    cost-effective manufacturing of dendritic cell therapies.  Given the large number
    of personalized cell-based therapies currently in clinical trials, and recently
    approved therapies, such a system is expected to address a major societal need
    and have significant commercial potential.  \n\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes
    to develop a manufacturing system to cover the steps involved in the manufacturing
    of autologous dendritic cell therapies.  Because of the low abundance of these
    cells in blood, dendritic cells are typically generated from blood-derived monocytes.
    \ Following differentiation of monocytes into dendritic cells, these cells are
    then matured and stimulated with tumor-specific antigens.  These steps represent
    discrete unit operations that require a system capable of handling both adherent
    and non-adherent cell types, different reagents for each step, and the ability
    to transition from one step to another with minimal loss of cells.  Further, all
    steps must be performed in a disposable single-use enclosure.  In order to achieve
    automation and integration of these steps, the proposed system will leverage innovations
    in perfusion-based dendritic cell culture and novel and cost-effective bioreactor
    design strategies.  A combination of computational modeling and rapid-prototyping
    techniques will be employed for rapid iteration of prototypes and testing with
    potential users involved in therapeutic development.  Successful completion of
    this project will result in feasibility demonstration of an integrated manufacturing
    system developed with significant end user feedback.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's

    This SBIR Phase I project is dedicated to producing software that makes it easy for people with special needs, especially those on the autism spectrum, to compose their own music. A wide base of evidence shows that music can be a powerful emotional and creative outlet for people with disabilities. Multiple studies show that music can help children on the autism spectrum improve their skills in social interaction, verbal communication,initiating behavior, and social-emotional reciprocity. However, public access to music education has declined dramatically in the United States over the last 40 years. The 6.6 million students in the US with special needs face further barriers to music education because of the significant financial resources and demanding degree of physical dexterity required by instrument lessons. Within this context, private sector innovation is more necessary than ever to increase the accessibility of music education. By offering affordable and intuitive software this project has the potential to make a major impact on the economy by helping to reduce education and health care costs for parents of children with special needs, school special education programs, and adults with disabilities. Just as importantly, democratizing the joy of musical creativity will make a powerful contribution to unlocking the passion, talents, and productivity of people with special needs.


    To make it easy for people with special needs to make their own music, this project will employ gestural composition, responsive design, and data science to produce a software interface that adapts to a users' accessibility preferences based on their previous interactions with the program. A second focus of the project is to produce interactive music lessons focused on self-expression and socio-emotional intelligence. Lessons will utilize and expand upon the creative interface to guide users to write songs that express their mood. Robust user testing and intelligent application of machine learning will be required to ensure that the interface smoothly evolves to enable user creativity. Considerable experimentation will also be required to build lessons which strike a balance between supporting users through linear instruction and empowering users to make expressive decisions and take ownership of their emotions. To mitigate the project's technical risk special needs experts and health professionals will be consulted at every stage of user testing and development. In sum, these innovations address the significant and urgent challenge of opening music up as a medium of creativity, communication and self-expression for people with special needs, especially those on the autism spectrum.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to develop a drug discovery platform for preclinical cancer drug testing using a 3D tumor model technology. The technology is designed to reduce time and costs associated with the high failure rate (~95%) of cancer drugs by increasing the likelihood that candidate drugs advancing to animal studies will be effective. The robotic technology will provide a biologically relevant tumor model to test libraries of cancer drugs in the preclinical stage, and replace currently used 2D cancer cell models. This project aims to scale up the 3D tumor model technology to accommodate large drug libraries tested in the pharmaceutical industry, and verify that it meets industry standards and customer needs. The technology will expedite the introduction of effective cancer drugs into the market for patient use, and help reduce the more than half a million of lives that cancer claims annually. The proposed work will significantly facilitate the introduction of the technology into the market as a preclinical cancer drug screening tool by demonstrating its competitive advantages and capabilities to improve cancer drug discovery efforts.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop and validate a 3D tumor model technology for high-throughput cancer drug screening in the pharmaceutical industry. Despite widespread interest in 3D cancer cell cultures, existing methods are not currently used in the industry due to their many disadvantages. The proposed technology provides a robust, high-throughput, and cost-effective approach to generate 3D cancer cell cultures for rapid drug screening, beyond what is currently available. This work will evaluate quantitatively the reliability and robustness of 3D cancer cell cultures and costs of cancer drug testing while considering competitive techniques. A major goal is to adapt the technology to a 1536-microwell plate format for highly efficient drug screening, which is not currently available on the market, and validate the capabilities of the technology to predict cancer drug responses in animal studies. This work will involve robotic protocol optimization, imaging analysis of 3D cultures for consistency, proof-of-concept cancer drug screening, and statistical evaluation of robustness. It is anticipated that the work will demonstrate the advantageous capacity and speed of the technology for drug testing, industry-level robustness, compatibility with different cancer cell types, ability to predict animal study drug responses, and low cost.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project views an IoT firearms detection system in the lens of the military due to their immediate need of such a device and associated data. In addition, a foothold in the military will allow for and influence the adoption in downstream markets such as private security and law enforcement who have already expressed interest in piloting and adopting this technology once fully developed. However, the broader goal and impact of this system more importantly grants the potential to save lives. Whether this system will be used in the military, law enforcement, or private citizens in cases of home and self defense, successful implementation and commercialization of the first firearms detection system will grant the capabilities to objectively monitor and leverage firearm usage data.

    The proposed project aims to research, develop, and commercialize an integrated IoT system dedicated to detecting and processing small arms firearm discharges. The challenge in achieving the goals of this project is two-fold: one to create an IoT system that satisfies the stringent and high standards of the customer and two, to create value within the data collected by these IoT sensors. The proposed research and development covers the creation of a prototype device as well as generating a roadmap based on product and user feedback towards effective use of the data to ensure commercial success.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in improving the quality of general and task lighting and reducing the amount of wasted light, thus reducing energy consumption. Solid state lighting has caused a paradigm shift in the lighting industry. However, the rapid growth of the LED has surpassed our understanding of its effects on human health and productivity, as well as the environment. Developing systems that put light only where it is needed can reduce energy consumption and improve well-being by eliminating glare and wasted light. Full control over where artificial lights shine may also reduce the disruption of natural ecosystems and agriculture caused by light pollution.? Unfortunately, a compact and low-cost solution to spatially controllable illumination is not available. Should one be brought to market, the industry could be tailored to meet the needs of each street lamp, each office worker and the entertainment industry among others. The ubiquitous nature of artificial illumination provides a unique commercial opportunity with multiple market segments for growth potential.

    The proposed project will focus on a microsystems solution to steerable lighting using a low-power, low-cost, silicon-based mirror less than 1 mm in diameter. The mirror is capable of real-time adjustments that will steer incident light with significant angular range. It is controlled using digital electronics and easily combined with traditional smart home electronics. The objective of the research is to measure the optical output of varying system setups and optical components to determine what optics are necessary for proper light output shape, uniformity, and color temperature. The project will rely heavily on a combination of test measurements and simulations to cycle through experiments rapidly and efficiently in order to converge on a manufacturing plan.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) project is the development of a microalgae-based commercial hydrogen
    production process that will surpass current or developing technologies. By 2022,
    the global hydrogen generation market by value is projected to reach $154.7 billion.
    A technology for low-cost, high purity, renewable, scalable hydrogen production
    will accelerate transition to a hydrogen economy, thus facilitating domestic energy
    independence and creating new economic opportunities. Many industries, such as
    the petro-chemical, chemical, and electronics industries, would benefit from low
    cost industrial hydrogen. Transportation and electric power generation industries
    also would benefit from increased fuel efficiency. Environmental benefits include
    replacement of fossil fuels, switching hydrogen production from natural gas to
    sunlight and water, and substantial reduction of harmful emissions. The goal of
    this project is to incorporate proprietary, metabolically engineered, photosynthetic
    algae in combination with recent advances in bioprocessing and hardware engineering
    to manufacture clean, renewable hydrogen. \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research
    Phase I project proposes to develop microalgae strains that generate high hydrogen
    yields using a novel metabolic engineering strategy. To pursue this strategy,
    a suitable parental strain must be developed, combining intact hydrogen production
    genes with improved stability of introduced genes (transgenes). Despite the availability
    of genetic transformation methods, transgene stability in wild type strains remains
    poor. This seriously limits development of commercial strains. Two algal UV mutants
    with greatly improved transgene stability are available, but both have impaired
    hydrogen production genes. The proposed investigation will assess the feasibility
    of creating a suitable parental strain. The objectives are: 1) determine differences
    between genes of the best wild type hydrogen producing strain and the UV mutants;
    2) introduce candidate genes into the UV mutants to restore hydrogen production
    metabolism; 3) knock out candidate genes involved in transgene inactivation in
    the wild type strain; and 4) test the ability of the engineered strains to generate
    hydrogen and retain transgenes. This project will produce the desired parental
    strain and enable implementation of the innovative strategy for developing production
    strains with greatly increased hydrogen rates in the target commercial process.\n\nThis

    This SBIR Phase I project is intended to develop a noninvasive, ultra-sensitive molecular
    detection system for Tuberculosis (TB). Although the prevalence of TB has diminished, it still
    remains the second leading cause of death from an infectious disease. The latest global TB report
    from the World Health Organization with data compiled from 205 countries put the figures at 1.5
    million fatalities and 9.6 million infections annually. The proposed technology uses the nano-
    Plasmonic Grating (P-GRAT) properties to enhance the detection signal of the TB biomarker by
    more than 100X. This results in detecting concentrations in femto-gram/milliliter range resulting
    in early detection and treatment. The specificity, faster results, low cost/test and ease of use,
    makes this system a substantive innovation in the TB diagnostic market. The TB testing market
    accounts for $1.5 billion annually of which North America is the second largest in terms of
    generated revenue due to the higher pricing for TB detection. The proposed technology will
    benefit the patients with early diagnosis and provide the health care professionals with early
    treatment options. With all the advantages this technology has to offer, it is expected to gain a
    significant share in the market place and generate a revenue stream.

    The main limitation of the immunoassays is their inability to detect extremely small fluorescence
    signals that are associated with ultra-low concentrations of biomarkers. The proposed nano-
    Plasmonic Grating (P-GRAT) technology can overcome this limitation due to its exceptionally
    efficient light coupling, reduced scattering, high signal-to-noise ratio and directional
    excitation/emission. As a result, a fluorescence enhancement of P-GRAT is 100X or higher
    compared to a glass substrates or polyurethane well plates. Such enhancements translate to ultrasensitive
    detection and early diagnosis. Commercial immunoassays require hours to days to
    achieve pg/ml sensitivity. In comparison, P-GRAT can detect pg/mL range concentrations in less
    than three hours. P-GRAT utilizes a simplified design to exclude expensive optics like laser
    sources, high-magnification objective lenses and filter cubes. The use of 3-D printed parts to
    fabricate the system and use a smartphone as the detector further reduces the cost. We intend to
    develop and commercialize a noninvasive, ultra-sensitive (fg/ml) molecular detection system for
    Tuberculosis (TB). TB specific biomarkers Lipoarabinomannan (LAM) and Interferon gamma
    (IFN-g) will be detected in urine and saliva. P-GRAT is a platform technology and can easily be
    adapted for the ultra-sensitive detection and diagnosis of other diseases, such as Zika, Ebola,
    HIV and Cancer.

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a minimally-invasive
    device that can be used to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) by safely
    injecting a proprietary substance into the base of the esophagus.  GERD is the
    most common gastrointestinal diagnosis in the US, afflicting ~26% of adult Americans
    (>60 million people), undermining their sleep, productivity, and quality of life,
    and leading to other gastrointestinal diseases. Approximately one third of GERD
    patients continue to suffer from symptoms despite currently available medications
    treatment. Moreover, long-term use of currently prescribed drugs has side effects
    and risks. Current surgical solutions are invasive, costly and carry significant
    risk. The proposed injection system is expected to enable a novel, less invasive
    and less costly treatment for GERD, leading to reduction of overall healthcare
    costs and preventing or reducing the incidence of other gastrointestinal diseases.
    Given the large market size for GERD and profound clinical need, this project
    directly addresses a critical barrier to developing such therapy for GERD patients.
    It has the potential to significantly improve treatment of such a common disorder,
    to become a standard of care and generate tax revenues and jobs. \n\nThe project
    seeks to develop an endoscopic injection system for consistent multiple injections
    of bulking agent into the submucosal tissue plane in the lower esophagus. At the
    heart of this technology will be a novel injection system that utilizes a suction
    port to grasp the esophageal wall and direct a needle tip to the desired submucosal
    depth of the affixed tissue. The design of the needle and needle guidance system
    will be optimized for injection of viscous solutions and will be used for injection
    of a bulking agent that creates submucosal tissue bulging at the lower esophagus,
    ultimately preventing gastroesophageal reflux. The proposed device will be unique
    in its ability to accurately guide submucosal injections to the desired tissue
    plane. This will be the first system to use vacuum assist for targeted injections
    into submucosal space. Rapid iterative 3D-printing prototyping will be employed
    to optimize needle guide geometry and design. Repeatability of the injections
    with the system will be tested into multiple samples of cadaveric porcine esophagus
    tissue and porcine cadavers. Impleo already owns an issued US method Patent to
    inject bulking agent in the esophagus and plans to generate additional IP in this
    project.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy
    of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to develop protein purification technology that will provide access to inexpensive, purified proteins for biological and life science applications by removing the purification bottleneck in biopharmaceutical production, and leveraging the innovative breakthroughs in protein engineering and gene editing.  Scale-up of this technology will transform the large-scale purification of biopharmaceuticals and lower prescription drug costs - the most important factor contributing to rising healthcare costs.  The major factor influencing the rising cost of healthcare is the skyrocketing costs of pharmaceuticals - up to 40% of the medical plan cost will be drugs by 2025.  Prescription drug costs are the fastest rising component of healthcare and are contributing to the dramatic increase in healthcare costs.  The worldwide focus of pharmacy and biotechnology is now on biopharmaceutical development and production to address this issue.  Direct benefits of this project include low-cost, use of green reagents, and the absence of heavy metal impurities in the purified protein.  In addition, the development of immobilized enzymes using this technology will open new frontiers in biocatalysis, biosensors, diagnostics and protein delivery.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop protein purification kits for small-scale and research-scale research. Bringing these kits to market will enable researchers to further validate the technology on a broader range of proteins in preparation for scale-up for biopharmaceutical production.  Synthetic biology has quickly begun to revolutionize drug discovery and design by providing a better overall molecular understanding of disease.  However, this potential has yet to be fully realized due to the challenges associated with purifying the target recombinant protein from the thousands of naturally-occurring proteins produced by the expression system.  The three specific aims of the project are: 1) validation of protein tag performance for multiple protein classes and expression systems, 2) development of low-cost methods for protein tag removal from purified proteins, and 3) development of solutions for the purification of low-expressing proteins and the parallel purification of small amounts of proteins.

    The broader impact / commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to enable electrification of remote oil & gas processes to reduce methane emissions, improve on-site safety, and provide leak-detection and monitoring capabilities. This will be achieved by developing a robust, efficient, small-scale power generator capable of converting on-site fuel to electricity. Beyond the entry opportunity in the oil & gas sector, this technology has other applications in large markets such as residential and commercial power generation and heating, transportation, and military. For example, our proposed generators would allow consumers in moderate/cold climates to efficiently match their time-dependent heating and electrical demands using natural gas (accessible to 70 million households). For a typical household in those regions, we estimate a 45% reduction in primary energy use and CO2 emissions by deploying our generators. The energy reduction translates to an annual savings of about $650 per household. Widespread deployment of our technology would grow the domestic natural gas economy, strengthen the US technological lead in semiconductor manufacturing, and facilitate renewables by providing a dispatchable supply.?

    The proposed project will investigate the fundamental heat-to-electric conversion process and address key issues around the stability and robustness of the technology, through a synergistic effort to develop generators capable of high performance and a manufacturing process to reduce cost. The project will focus on device optimization and durability, and process repeatability. This involves the fabrication and integration of multiple frequency-selective components including a thermal emitter, optical filter, photovoltaic cell, and back surface reflector. Each component, as well as the integrated system, will undergo rigorous thermal testing to prove both resistance to elevated temperatures and temperature swings. Additionally, novel manufacturing techniques will be developed to enable cost-competitive devices relative to conventional generators. If the technical objectives are met, this project will demonstrate record-breaking performance for thermophotovoltaics and accelerate the commercialization of thermophotovoltaic devices in many different markets.?

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will explore a novel materials processing technology that progresses the state-of-the-art of carbon fiber composites while leveraging mature and cost-efficient manufacturing methods. The processing technology of interest produces a material that approaches the isotropic properties of high-performance metal alloys while retaining the light-weight and stiffness of carbon fiber composites. Components that are fabricated from this new composite will have higher impact strength and reduced susceptibility to delamination, compared to commercially-available carbon fiber composites. The broader impact of this project includes providing engineers with a new tool to implement previously unfeasible designs that drastically improve performance while reducing energy consumption and material waste. The rapid adoption of carbon fiber composites in the wind energy, aerospace, and defense industries provides an opportunity for the novel material developed in this project to disrupt the $25-billion global carbon fiber composite market. Effective scale-up to industrial production of the novel carbon fiber composite can revitalize the Massachusetts textiles manufacturing ecosystem and increase the competitiveness of the U.S. advanced materials manufacturing base.

    The intellectual merit of this project is the continuous production of a three-dimensionally (3-D) reinforced carbon fiber prepreg that features a carbon fiber fabric reinforced with vertically aligned short carbon fibers. This novel material provides a laminated composite part with dense through-thickness and interlaminar reinforcement. Conventional carbon fiber laminates lack through-thickness reinforcement and rely on an unfilled polymer matrix to bind the layers of the laminate together, resulting in poor impact performance and frequent delamination. This project involves the roll-to-roll fabrication of 3-D reinforced carbon fiber prepregs and characterization of the produced composite material. The anticipated result of the project is the repeatable fabrication of a 3-D reinforced carbon fiber prepreg with enhanced performance compared to commercially-available prepregs. Successful completion of this project will enable further scale-up of the associated manufacturing technology and the commercial-launch of novel 3-D reinforced carbon fiber prepregs to produce stronger, lighter, and more durable composite structures.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop the process to 3D print continuous fiber reinforced ceramic matrix composite (CMC) components for turbine and combustion engines, hypersonic vehicles, and satellites. CMCs are currently a $2.5b market that is expected to triple over the next decade. The ability to produce CMCs with 3D printing will enable superior designs in current applications, as well as enabling their use in a greater number of components that are currently limited by the higher density and lower temperature capabilities of superalloys such as Inconel and Invar. Developing this manufacturing process will enable more basic materials research by serving as a lower cost testbed for new CMC compositions since a mold is not required and turnaround times are much faster. This will also allow engineers to develop more optimized systems with a faster design cycle. This capability will result in efficiency increases in turbine and combustion engines for substantial improvements in fuel efficiency, reducing costs and environmental impact. Finally, the ability to 3D print CMCs will vastly improve geometric complexity of high temperature components, which will enable the next generation of hypersonic vehicles, supporting national defense.

    The intellectual merit of this project is in establishing a novel manufacturing process for CMCs based on 3D printing. Melt infiltration is a low cost method to produce CMCs, which starts with a polymer matrix composite that is pyrolyzed, and then infiltrated with a molten metal. The matrix is usually a phenolic thermoset, but high temperature thermoplastics have recently been proven viable for simple coupons. This project will use 5-axis continuous fiber reinforced high temperature thermoplastic composites as green bodies. Since thermoplastics melt, support materials will be implemented during the pyrolysis step, which are effective in retaining part geometry. Additionally, a novel process of growing a boron nitride interphase layer on the fibers after pyrolysis instead of prior to forming the polymer composite will be implemented since tight corners during printing might damage an interphase layer. Finally, 3D printing with larger bend radius silicon carbide fibers instead of carbon fibers will be attempted. This project will demonstrate the effectiveness of this interphase with improved flexural strength and toughness, and the ability to form geometrically complex CMCs that are extremely difficult, if not impossible, to make with other methods. These two milestones will enable a path to begin developing parts for customers in commercial applications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer(STTR) project is to develop a bio-based manufacturing process for glucaric acid and its intermediate, glucuronic acid. Microbial fermentation represents an attractive option for production of fuels and valuable chemicals from renewable resources, and glucaric acid can be produced from glucose, a renewable biomass-derived resource.  The glucaric acid market was estimated at $550M in 2016, and has a plethora of uses ranging from detergents to food ingredients, corrosion inhibitors, and de-icing applications.  The proposed project will engineer improved productivity of the microbe using C5/C6 sugars, thus accelerating the production of low-cost, high-purity glucaric acid. Achieving these bioprocess improvements will facilitate widespread adoption of bio-based glucaric acid in a variety of markets, broadening opportunity for US products. These applications include coatings, foams and foaming aids, electrolytes, gels, polymers, and polymer additives.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to perform multi-omics studies to characterize the physiology of E. coli strains producing glucaric acid via fermentation, and develop strain engineering strategies to enable high yield and productivity. Most fermentation products are highly reduced compared to the starting sugar, and care must be taken to maintain cells in a reduced state, meaning high NADH/NAD ratio, to drive the NADH-consuming biosynthetic reactions. Products that are derived from sugar oxidation, in contrast, pose a much different challenge, and have been explored to a much lesser extent. Here, additional oxygen is needed to accept the excess electrons generated during glucose oxidation. It is well known that both S. cerevisiae and E. coli, two of the most common organisms for industrial application, are limited in their electron transport chain capacity, resulting in overflow products from high glucose uptake rates. Regardless of the oxygen transfer ability of the fermentation equipment, there is an inherent maximum production rate of these organisms. In this project, the plan is to develop E. coli strains with increased respiration capacity, thus increasing the maximum glucose oxidation rate. Glucaric acid, which can be produced from glucose via 3 enzymatic reaction steps, is an exemplary product.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to provide the agriculture market a long-term solution to the problem of premature wear on components from oil leaks  by digitally monitoring oil levels in combines. The proposed product could be adapted to many industries including agriculture, mining, construction, marine water craft, chemical storage, military vehicles, and water storage. The proposed product will preemptively warn equipment operators of low lubrication levels thereby saving customers money from repairs or replacement of new systems.

    The proposed project will address the need of digitally monitoring oil lubrication levels while producing a highly accurate measurement in real-time. The solution will be non-contacting unlike current solutions that provide a single low-level alarm or rely on manual checks. The prototype will be put in a simulated as well as real-time environment to investigate endurance, accuracy, stability, longevity, reliability and ease of installation. Objectives include: (1) Find a solution/configuration to accurately monitor rapid level changes; (2) Verify the hardware can withstand harsh conditions (extreme temperatures, high vibration); (3) Software testing; and (4) Analyze different reservoirs to see how the product can be easily mounted.

    finding a practical and cost-effective protective cap for baseball pitchers susceptible
    to serious head injuries from impacts of batted baseballs. The new cap design
    satisfactorily addresses the shortcomings of previous commercialization efforts
    that were unable to meet the prescribed protective requirements; failed to pass
    both the players' fashion expectations and comfort evaluation; and carried a hefty
    purchase price. The acceptance and use of the new cap by professional baseball
    players will create widespread demand from collegiate, high school and Little
    League players, a market that is estimated to generate annual revenues of more
    than $18M. These market projections exclude consideration of the technology's
    Broader Impact potential in other sports or vocational and military applications,
    where there is a growing recognition of the need for improved head protection
    for athletes, soldiers, law enforcement officials and construction workers. Sports
    injuries are now highly scrutinized, especially those causing long-term medical
    issues from brain injury, blunt force trauma and repetitive concussive injury.
    The societal value of this innovation will be found in safer sports and work environments.
    Such equipment represents a rapidly growing segment of the apparel market and
    a unique commercial opportunity for the company. \n\nThe intellectual merit of
    this project is based on the company's patented design that provides head protection
    from the impact of a baseball. The novelty of the protective cap headliner is
    its flexible outer hard shell made with highly rigid interconnecting truncated
    icosahedron panels. This allows the headliner to conform to the shape of the head
    while maintaining the stiffness needed to diffuse impact loads.  Since the impact
    of a baseball represents a short duration point load, the energy-absorbing capacity
    of the layer beneath the outer shell can be minimized. The objective is to identify
    the material characteristics required to dissipate the impact load associated
    with a Severity Index of 1200 or greater when a head-form is struck by a baseball
    traveling at speeds up to 125 mph; and to identify the material combination(s)
    best suited to achieve this goal. Traditional foam materials as well as state-of-the-art
    material compositions will be used in unique configurations to produce solutions
    that are not too heavy, not too bulky nor too hot to wear. The outcomes of this
    study will determine the availability of materials that can be used within the
    ergonomic and mechanical constraints of the patented design to protect the head.\n\nThis

    speeds by 100x when compared with conventional methods in confocal and multiphoton

    gross revenue of $75M. The technology also promises to benefit 3D imaging systems
    for manufacturing or machine vision, optical coherence tomography, and endoscopic
    imaging systems by providing high speed and agile focus control. While MEMS are
    ubiquitous in mobile platforms and the automotive industry for motion sensing,
    they have not yet permeated other markets or imaging systems to the same extent.
    With recent advances in fabrication and performance of optical MEMS devices, bringing
    this type of technology to other platforms can spark greater commercialization

    project is foremost the demonstration of a novel optomechanical system with MEMS
    mirrors for independent control of focusing and zoom in microscopy. MEMS mirrors
    are a type of varifocus element. They remain stationary while their voltage-controlled,

    and significant focusing capability, have not previously been demonstrated in
    literature or commercially. By producing and characterizing fast, large-diameter
    MEMS mirrors for this project, knowledge of varifocus elements will be advanced.
    This project will also continue to define standard optical design practices to
    best utilize varifocus elements, since traditional optical analyses assume fixed
    focal length lenses or mirrors. The project objectives are three-fold: 1) fabricate
    large-diameter MEMS mirrors with greater than 40% yield, 2) characterize their
    focusing range and dynamic behavior, and 3) demonstrate them in a focus and zoom
    system suitable as a microscopy add-on component.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to significantly increase the efficiency and reduce operating costs for water produced by membrane-based desalination.  Water scarcity is an increasingly important global-scale issue that has significant negative impacts on health, security and economies.  Recent forecasts show a dramatic increase in the number of countries that will soon be affected by water scarcity given that global water consumption is expected to significantly increase due to population growth.  Membrane-based water desalination, which at large scale requires a huge capital investment, is recognized as a primary technology that can significantly improve supply to meaningfully offset scarcity and its impacts.  A critical factor in desalination plant operations is energy consumption, which increases due to membrane fouling, thus making fouling one of the most significant factors controlling the efficiency of these plants.  The proposed in-situ, real-time sensing system can be the enabling technology to allow implementation of advanced plant control algorithms based upon accurate detection of fouling at its earliest stages.  Such active detection capability will enable the most effective implementation of fouling mitigation strategies that can be optimized to save energy and reduce cost.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a novel time-reversal waveguide sensor for detection of early-stage (ES) fouling in reverse osmosis (RO) membrane desalination, which is the dominant technology for desalinating brackish water and seawater.  Fouling in RO systems has inorganic (scaling) and organic (biofouling) components and can be a highly variable process that depends on operational parameters as well as environmental conditions.  Efficient implementation of real-time control of RO desalination for fouling mitigation requires real-time sensing.  The overall objective of the proposed work is to develop sophisticated ultrasonic sensor technology that can reliably detect scaling and biofouling in the challenging multi-layer, spiral-wound (SW) geometry of commercial-scale RO systems.  The proposed work will make use of time-reversal mirrors to produce a simple signal from a multi-mode waveguide independent of the geometry of the waveguide configuration, thus overcoming the exceedingly complex and difficult to interpret signals associated with the use of a standalone waveguide.  The goals of the project are to demonstrate the capability to detect both early-stage inorganic and organic fouling under realistic operating conditions, the reliability and the robustness of the technology, and the ability to adapt the technology to the larger size modules that are increasingly important for commercial operation.

    Research (SBIR) project addresses the critical societal need to remediate widespread
    problems of toxic organic pollutants in soils, sediments and groundwater.  The
    technology results in a significantly improved ability to destroy organic environmental
    contaminants by reducing treatment time and costs at commercial scales using novel
    bacterial strains.  These strains have a demonstrated ability to rapidly degrade
    a variety of important, recalcitrant organic pollutants including polychlorinated
    biphenyls (PCBs), polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PaHs) and dioxins.  This project
    will assess the costs and efficacy of the large-scale implementation of this technology
    that includes the incubation of the contaminated material at elevated temperatures
    (60¢ªC/150¢ªF) to enhance degradation.  This enables environmental goals to be
    met on many sites whose cleanup is currently limited by the high costs of remediation.
    The commercial impact is significant and makes possible the re-development of
    many billions of dollars of real estate in these categories to return these properties
    to productive and appropriate use.  Additional aspects of the technology are applicable
    to emerging pollutants such as 1,4-dioxane in groundwater and greatly expand the
    options available to environmental engineers and landowners for cleaning up long-lived

    by using heat-tolerant bacteria for faster rates of chemical destruction for a
    broad range of pollutants.  Objectives include the evaluation of the efficacy
    and costs to treat large amounts (5-10 tons) of material with whole bacteria as
    basis to assess the commercial application of the technology.  This involves several
    components, including the optimization of the large-scale cell production protocols
    to produce the bacteria.  In conjunction with environmental engineering firms,
    the project also will develop cost-effective approaches to maintaining the appropriate
    temperature, moisture and oxygen conditions for optimal cell growth during large-scale
    treatments.  Variations in incubation conditions and flocculent additions will
    be used to determine the lowest pollutant levels that can be attained.  Finally,
    a new approach using cell extracts instead of live cells will be evaluated for
    both soils and sediments as well as for soluble pollutants like 1,4-dioxane.  These
    approaches will provide critical data on remediation costs at commercial scale
    and also evaluate new approaches to emerging groundwater pollutants that are difficult
    to remediate with current technology."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project includes advancement of the field of white biotechnology, which utilizes enzymes to create valuable industrial products. As biological molecules, enzymes are more difficult to work with than conventional chemicals and often need more extensive development before they can be adapted to industrial or pharmaceutical manufacturing. This SBIR project will demonstrate how enzymes performance can be improved using stabilization with synthetic polymers. Enzymes are characterized by precise, unique structure and function, which is in turn essential for their role in catalysis of complex chemical reactions. Synthetic polymers, on the other hand, despite being less precisely structured, can be rationally designed to withstand or respond to chemical, thermal or biological conditions. The synergistic fusion of enzymes and synthetic polymers results in advanced nano-armored enzyme with improved properties such as solvent and temperature resistance, and modulated activity. Creating such novel stabilized enzymes will result in more efficient commercial utilization of enzymatic catalysis which requires less energy, utilizes less hazardous reagents, and generates less waste while generating valuable products such as chemicals, biofuels, and pharmaceuticals.

    This SBIR  Phase I project proposes to develop a combinatorial synthesis device that can feed high-throughput screening of enzyme-polymer conjugates with desired properties (for instance, temperature, pH- or organic solvent stability). To date, only low-throughput synthesis and characterization methods have been applied to the preparation of enzyme-polymer conjugates, limiting development to only few types of polymer modification per protein and depending on stochastic guesswork to select the variants tested. Thus, in order to fully benefit from the diverse set of polymers currently available on the market one has to consider methods of scaling the identification of optimally performing enzyme-polymer conjugates. This will be achieved through combination of high-throughput synthesis of enzyme-polymer conjugates and high-throughput screening of gained properties. The initial target application of the proposed research is focused on the industrial biocatalysis. Application of a high-throughput method will not only result in faster research and development cycles, but also will accelerate our development of fundamental knowledge of what kind of protein properties can be gained through polymer modification, thereby establishing this method for industrial applications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is in the development of novel water treatment technologies that can improve access to clean water and reduce the cost of water treatment. The innovation is a drop-in-replacement nanofiltration membrane that is chlorine-resistant, highly permeable, and uniquely customizable. The chlorine resistance allows for the continuous chlorination of the membrane, which can reduce bio-fouling and thereby increase the lifespan of a membrane; this has been a chief innovation target for more than 30 years. The customizability aspect also facilitates capture of lead and other heavy-metals, broadening the reach of nanofiltration membranes to sectors that generate significant amounts of wastewater, such as semiconductor, mining, pulp-and-paper, and colorant industries. These improvements to nanofiltration technology have clear and direct societal and economic impact by facilitating water reuse and offering clean and affordable water solutions. SBIR project funding is enabling the transition of this promising membrane technology from the laboratory setting into the early commercialization stages of a valuable new product.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to improve the commercial viability of novel nanofiltration membranes through the development of more-scalable and tunable synthesis and manufacturing protocols. The technology is based on self-assembling block copolymers with customizable chemical functionalities. Previous methods for the synthesis and casting of the polymers are not ideal, so new protocols are being developed. The changes to polymer and membrane manufacturing methods will be conducted systematically to develop new structure-property-performance relationships that will contribute new knowledge for broader membrane optimization efforts. A more thorough understanding of how polymer chemistry dictates membrane performance will also be cultivated by investing in the customization aspects of the technology. Finally, the performance characteristics of resulting nanofiltration membranes will be rigorously tested with respect to permeability, chlorine-resistance, separations, and heavy metal capture. The overall results will help advance nanofiltration membrane technology into a platform that is highly modular and can address a wider range of separations challenges than is currently possible.

    will connect the classroom and home learning experience and allow both parents
    and teachers to see how each child is performing and where they need to intervene
    to help.  Over time, the project will test and deploy new ways to learn. The potential
    commercial market for this product includes parents, homeschoolers, and teachers.
    \ The initial target market is kindergarten to 8th grade.  The project will improve
    education outcomes at these crucial ages. \n\nThe project uses patent-pending
    technology that combines a set of probabilistic engines to determine the right
    content for each student based on their individual ability.  It does not determine
    content based on their age or grade and makes no assumptions about what the student
    can or can?t do.  Instead, it allows the student to set their own limits and use
    Big Data to predict and test optimal learning paths.   The learning engine can
    work with any category of educational content and deliver that content dynamically
    to any type of game.  The project can measure the learning impact by making changes
    to the traditional learning paths within clusters of students.  It will uncover
    if, for example, fractions should be introduced earlier to all children, or subsets
    of children. As opposed to the option of skipping a grade or being held back,
    a student doing well (or poorly) could be in the same class with their peers and
    still have unique content that challenges them and maximizes their natural abilities.

    Research (SBIR) project is to produce polymer composites that enable commercialization
    of alkaline electrochemical devices, such fuel cells and electrolyzers. The use
    of fuel cell technologies will help preserve the environment, mitigate climate
    change, decreasing our carbon footprint and securing renewable energy supply.
    Electrolyzers are an increasingly attractive method of producing ultrapure hydrogen,
    an essential chemical feedstock and fuel. Currently, widespread adoption of these
    technologies is prevented by the high system costs, which are driven by the platinum
    catalysts. Operating under alkaline conditions with alkaline exchange membranes
    (AEMs) is necessary to relieve this pain point by allowing the use non-precious
    metal catalysts (e.g. stainless steel, nickel, cobalt, and their alloys). Moreover,
    AEMs will be less expensive to produce and recyclable at the end of lifetime,
    unlike the existing polymer electrolytes, further decreasing the cost of devices.
    Producing commercially viable AEMs enables the widespread deployment of fuel cell
    and electrolyzer systems by making the technology economically competitive with
    incumbent fossil fuel based energy sources.  \n\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes
    to produce polymer electrolyte composites that meet the stringent performance
    criteria for a commercially viable AEM, including durability, hydroxide conductivity
    and mechanical strength under alkaline operating conditions. A proprietary polymer
    composition with unprecedented chemical stability will be incorporated into microporous
    polymer structural supports. Typically, cation percentage in AEMs must be kept
    low, otherwise the membranes swell excessively and deteriorate during operation.
    Incorporating polymers into structural supports permits increased cation concentration
    and ion exchange capacity (IEC), resulting in AEMs with high hydroxide conductivity.
    Furthermore, the mechanical strength of the composite is determined by the support
    and is not reduced by high IEC, like unsupported membranes. A polymerization method
    will be employed that allows fine control over cation concentration and the reaction
    can be conducted inside the support, simplifying composite fabrication. The combination
    of our unique polymer composition and a structural support that maximizes conductivity
    without losing mechanical strength, is a crucial milestone for the commercialization
    of our technology."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to develop smart software to plan and control Electric Vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure in commercial facilities, such as workplaces, hotels, car rental centers, parking garages, etc. The EV planning software finds the optimal design balancing design tradeoffs such as EV customer satisfaction, grid stability limits and financial constraints. This software will help facility operators to optimize their EV charging infrastructure by minimizing their operating costs and maximizing their revenue by utilizing intelligent scheduling and pricing strategies. The software leverages the latest developments in stochastic optimization for designing an optimal configuration of EV infrastructure that is robust to variations in mobility behavior of the users. This will enable public utilities to save billions of dollars by deferring expensive upgrades to their existing infrastructure. It will also empower small consulting businesses, facility managers and electrical contractors to design and build EV infrastructure without any specialized knowledge of optimization or modeling.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project addresses the problem of planning and controlling EV charging infrastructure to meet the rapidly growing energy demands of EV owners. EVs are expected to comprise 30% of all cars globally by 2030. This forecasted increase over the next 10 years is of major concern for utilities, and commercial real estate owners. Given the long commute distances, driving habits, time taken to charge using home-based chargers and range anxiety, there is a need for charging locations at workplaces, hotels, and car rental centers. Chargers at these locations will generally be medium power Level 2 chargers, which are 5 to 10 times the size of typical home chargers. Simultaneous uncontrolled charging of several EVs at these locations will easily overload the local electrical infrastructure. The software mitigates this problem by designing an optimal EV infrastructure together with optimally sized onsite generation and storage. The controlling solution ensures that the grid impacts are minimized by scheduling the installed EV chargers together with onsite generation and storage with optimal set points in real time.

    Phase I project is the improved identification of young children who may be at
    risk for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Autism is a growing concern as rates
    continue to increase, however many experts in child development are hopeful that
    early intervention can help reduce many of the challenges of living with autism.
    \ As the brain undergoes important critical periods of development in the first
    year of life, it is important to try and identify opportunities for intervention
    as early as infancy. However, infants have limited means to express themselves
    and it can be difficult for parents and even pediatricians to track the subtle
    behavioral cues that can be indicative of autism at this early age.  The goal
    of this proposal is to improve access to tools that help make infants developing
    thinking and social skills more observable to pediatricians and parents. By creating
    a consumer version of an old technique used by psychologists to understand infant
    development, this work will increase access to tools to track infants' behaviors
    related to autism.  \n\nThe proposed project is novel in its repurposing of an
    established laboratory psychology tool, the nonnutritive sucking paradigm. Basically,
    psychologists long ago learned that infants will alter their rate of sucking on
    a pacifier when they are interested in something. Psychologists recorded from
    a pacifier to gauge what an infant was interested in as well as an infant's growing
    understanding of language, social interaction, math, and a wide variety of cognitive
    and social skills. They also allowed infants to control the presentation of sounds
    or images through their sucking patterns. This SBIR project is creating a more
    accessible version of this established smart pacifier technique to allow parents
    and pediatricians to also better track an infant?s interest, preferences, and
    social and cognitive development. This effort will develop a consumer friendly
    smart pacifier that can control sounds or images on software or mobile applications.
    By designing software that replicates the social and cognitive assessment paradigms
    in psychology laboratories, the smart pacifier system can increase access to objective
    behavioral assessment tools. Similar to growing evidence in eye-tracking behavior,
    this behavioral assessment tool can be used to better assess behaviors that have
    been linked to the future development of autism."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to ultimately increase the number of women in STEM careers, thus allowing women to secure higher paying jobs and to expand global innovation by increasing the number of women who are inventing future technologies. Research demonstrates a direct connection between play and academic pursuits, yet few STEM products appeal to the 10MM+ pre-adolescent U.S. girls.  Our hypothesis is that by designing an Internet of Things (IoT) platform of interactive decor building kits with motion and lighting features, we can engage girls in hands-on STEM learning during a formative time in their emotional and intellectual development. The kits will offer educational and exploratory opportunities including spatial and sequential thinking, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and programming. The user guides and on-line learning modules will be authored and designed to create and build a STEM identity in girls. Our theory is that this hands-on experience will create attitudinal and identity shifts in girls to motivate them to pursue additional STEM academic opportunities and further their exploration with other STEM activities.

    The proposed project is a method to provide an entrance to STEM experiences for a population typically not recognizing their strengths and abilities in the STEM areas. This is accomplished by leading them through an IoT modular product platform to build personalizable decor accessories as they pursue their interest in decorating and the arts.  The proposed project?s objectives are: (1) design and build a hardware prototype; (2) design and build an app prototype; (3) design and conduct research to determine that interaction with the proposed IoT modular platform results in an attitudinal shift toward STEM. The project will employ research methods including a large scale learning styles survey (400 users); moderated and recorded user feedback sessions, and in-person studies (15 users) using questionnaires adapted from published research and academic assessments.  Our success parameters are: (1) 50% of users can build and program the IoT product; (2) 20% of girls experience an increase in STEM areas; (3) 15% improvement in short-term recall of STEM skills and vocabulary; (4) 25% of users report an interest in trying another STEM experience; (5) 50% of users report they would display completed product in their room.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to transform the life experiences of youth patients in the Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) community by providing an affordable, comprehensive mobile platform for monitoring health behaviors, tracking biometrics, fostering self-empathy/empowerment, and developing healthy diabetes self-management practices (DSM) through a gamified app. Adherence to DSM behaviors is an exacting issue with conventional T1D treatment and prevention regimens, though the use of features found in gaming technologies has been shown to be motivating in apps for chronic illnesses. Data-tracking applications meant for public health are believed to yield hidden trends on diet, fitness, mood, and compliance in both individuals and populations, identifying behavioral patterns that may be useful for positive behavior change. With a far-reaching and accessible intervention leveraging the motivational power of games, empathy, and social interaction, health professionals can use this intervention to encourage long-term engagement with data-tracking, which in turn creates rich data sets for tapping into the unseen trends of T1D experiences, contributing to the growing body of T1D knowledge, enriching T1D youth's quality of life, and streamline patient-provider communications in a cost-effective way that benefits the health care system as a whole.

    The proposed project aims to provide a better understanding of the affordances of digital technologies in DSM, with emphases on the role of technology as a facilitator of diabetes education, DSM, patient-provider communications, emotional wellness, social and cognitive development, and positive behavior change. T1D diagnoses represent more than 175,000 youth in the United States, and despite significant headway in other areas of mobile health, many families struggle to access T1D tools that dramatically improve the quality of life and health outcomes of their children. To meet this demand, the objectives of this research begin with engineering a full-featured youth-facing prototype¯starring an empathetic virtual pet¯capable of collecting multiple streams of user data and teaching via instructional modules. Data collected during usability studies with stakeholders in the diabetes community will provide insight into effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction of users, while a feasibility study also employing interviews, surveys, and think aloud protocols will offer insight into the practical use of the app in everyday life over a weeklong period. After both of these studies have been conducted, transcripts of recorded sessions and log file data will be analyzed, with the goal of improving the feasibility of extended product usage and success.

    an experiential simulation learning lab by funding the technical conversion from
    what is essentially a hardwired product requiring a dedicated lab available to
    schools within a limited geographic area to a nationally available online product.
    \ Additionally, the funding will drive the technological innovation necessary
    to maintain the immersive, experiential nature of the existing prototype. The
    project will also allow for research on the underlying assumption of the product:
    \ will students be more engaged during content instruction if they are aware that
    they will be asked to apply their learning in an upcoming simulation?  And, if
    so, will the improved engagement carry over to improved performance on summative
    assessments?  Since the unique nature of the product places it in the middle of
    the educational technology continuum between digital content and assessment, using
    current market trends to estimate its sales potential is difficult. However, offering
    the product online will dramatically decrease its current price point, making
    the product economically attractive to thousands of teachers and schools across
    the United States seeking curriculum that engages students who learn best in a

    to a specific location on a device and using this technology for inspiring and
    educating middle and high school students in Science, Technology, Engineering,
    Art, and Mathematics (STEAM). Global expanding markets for DJ gear, a $1.587B
    dollar growth industry, over the past 3 years grew in sales by 21%. As technology
    and entertainment converge, DJs represent the new \"Superstar\" for today's youth.
    Thus, this research represents an incentivizing gateway for students to learn
    how math, engineering and science intellectual assets can contribute to musical
    and artistic innovation. Additionally, middle and/or junior high school students'
    analysis of the data derived from a performance and entertainment-related technology
    can be an incentivizing and engaging entrance into STEM academic subjects such
    as systems design, acoustics, and computer coding.  Given the DJ tool's relation
    to these topics as well as music's inherent link with physics and math, its integration
    into the curriculum of after-school programming options are expected to foster
    more interdisciplinary STEM learning. Afterschool turntable academies as thematic
    contexts for STEM learning function as supportive and assistive educational venues.
    Collectively, the broader impact of this project should produce economic competitiveness
    in the music/technology industry for the U.S. overall and, specifically for youth,
    enhanced engagement in STEM fields.\n \nThe intellectual merit of this project
    stems from the necessity for individuals to seamlessly interface with the digital
    world without losing creativity, artistry or individuality. The technical innovation
    emerges from determining the coordinate location of an analog audio occurrence,
    tracking the change in occurrences, and matching it to a digital counterpart to
    follow the changes created. The sensor data points are utilized to metamorphose
    the turntable, the musical instrument of the DJ, into a complete analog/digital
    educational tool. This technology can offer critical insights to STEM learning
    and educational opportunities to students who may feel that STEM concepts or careers
    are separate from their personal interests and cultural context. Anticipated outcomes
    include advancements in the arts, sciences and education by contributing to entertainment's
    most recent and broadly recognized musical instrument and making it more available
    in middle and high school STEM educational curricula and after school activities.
    The proposed research intends to investigate, identify and resolve current liabilities
    connected with the transient acoustic degradation, deleterious latency introduction,
    and physical performance loss by systems intended to mimic the analog turntable.
    The research objective will be to create novel interface models to analyze the

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project includes education of water engineering processes and training for success in the advanced technology economy and workforce. Plant Control will teach students the system that supplies safe drinking water to their schools and homes while applying chemistry and engineering concepts in an engaging format. Student exposure to engineering in high school is correlated to choice of STEM majors in college. The product will introduce students to a wide range of disciplines including civil, electrical, mechanical, biological, and materials to promote student choice of engineering majors. The disruption of clean drinking water in Flint, MI highlights the critical importance of safe drinking water and technical hurdles that an aging utility infrastructure presents. Water quality STEM concepts presented in this product are essential for a voting population to make local and federal decisions related to population growth and aging utility infrastructure. High School STEM classrooms are centers of innovation for students. This product will provide the students a sand-box tool to develop their own control and data acquisition as well as train them in software that is widely used in the controls and data acquisition industry.

    The proposed project will develop a simulation and remote plant model intended to engage students in a new context and compliment STEM engineering curriculum in K-12 environments. The goals of the research are to understand the effect of simulation learning tools on STEM education, to develop a simulator for educational and workforce training purposes, and to develop a programming tool to enable student and maker applications of control and data acquisition systems that is currently lacking in that market. Simulation development technical hurdles include flow modeling in a wide-range of student defined configurations, equipment and filtration media. The simulation developed in this project will be further applied in the water and wastewater market to train plant operators for standard and emergency plant operation conditions. The web-accessible remote plant model component of the project requires connectivity of nationwide users to the remote plant and protection of the physical plant equipment. The development platform used for control of the plant will be available to the students for modification and use in their own projects. The student-version will require a limited and simplified version of the professional platform currently available. Development of the student version will require platform reconfiguration and user capability modification.

    This SBIR phase I project will develop new reagents to enable cell separation and analysis. Cell separation is a $3.9 billion/yr market with applications in medicine, pharmaceutical, and biological research industries. However, many current schemes perform cell separation and analysis in separate steps. A single reagent that could perform both functions would save time and money, enhancing these industries. The nanoparticle reagent developed by this research possesses magnetic properties to enable cell separation, and fluorescent properties that allow properties of separated cells to be quantified. This research will optimize this product and demonstrate proof-of-concept against the current standard approaches. The proposed product is the result of basic research previously funded by the NSF into methods to combine magnetic and fluorescent reagents, and optimization of this reagent will yield basic knowledge in manufacture and scale-up of these nanomaterials. Successful completion of these goals will lead to a new product that will enable cell separation and analysis with a single reagent, enabling cell separation with high purity and increasing signal used for quantification. These benefits could translate into reduced laboratory healthcare costs with increased diagnostic efficiency, improved pharmaceutical purity, and high tech nanomanufacturing jobs in this burgeoning industry.

    This research will develop magnetic-fluorescent nanoparticle reagents to enable seamless cell separation and subsequent flow cytometry analysis. Cell separation is often performed with magnetic reagents that enable high throughput; however, analysis of the separated product is performed in a separate step, typically via flow cytometry. The use of large magnetic beads for separation prevents analysis, as the beads employed are much larger than the protein quantified. Even if small nanoparticles are used, a separate reagent is required for analysis, and signal is limited as the same receptors are targeted for both separation and analysis steps. Thus, a reagent that could perform both separation and analysis steps would improve performance. This research will optimize nanoparticle reagents that enable separation and analysis and compare their performance to the current approach using two separate reagents. Thus, this research will demonstrate crucial proof-of-concept of these reagents that are manufactured using a scalable process, enabling rapid transition to beta testing and follow-on commercialization.

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to provide clinical decision support software
    that assists inpatient providers in improving care for preventable acute inpatient
    harms, and thereby reduce mortality and morbidity. This grant develops a cloud-based
    platform that applies machine learning (ML) algorithms in real-time on data extracted
    from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and physiologic monitoring devices attached
    to a patient. The ML tools employed estimate the degree of reliability for each
    of the data elements as they are collected and integrates these signals to provide
    an accurate, individualized risk estimate of patient health over time in order
    to best guide patient treatment and allocation of hospital resources. Our initial
    target condition is sepsis, one of the most costly and most deadly diseases in
    hospitals. This grant develops an end-to-end system to provide risk assessment
    and implementation of timely treatment. For commercial potential, the underlying
    core technology can be extended to other clinical scenarios. \n\nThe proposed
    project enables scaling of high-precision state-of-the-art Bayesian machine learning
    techniques that forecast the chance of acute deterioration. This includes tackling
    the challenges in scaling this machine learning system to function across many
    care providers, patients, and hospitals. To achieve these goals, this project
    will develop new methods for running machine learning algorithms in a distributed
    fashion in cloud computing settings, especially in distinguishing where multiple
    machines need to coordinate, and arguably more importantly, where they can avoid
    coordinating in training on data. Further, the project develops software to provide
    information back to providers so as to enable interventions that can alter patient
    trajectory. Here the software will encompass how to best use the resulting inferences
    in guiding care."

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology
    Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is in automating the process of unbiased stereology,
    the state-of-the-method used in the life sciences for counting stained cells on
    tissue sections.  Unbiased stereology allows neuroscientists to accurately analyze
    the size and number of brain cells, which are altered in many neurological disorders
    and mental illnesses. For reasons that are currently unknown, Alzheimer's disease,
    Parkinson's disease and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis are all associated with
    a progressive loss of brain cells. In contrast, children with autism are born
    with too many brain cells, which leads to life-long problems in processing complex
    streams of information.  Stereology plays an important role in investigating many
    conditions affecting the brain and assessing the efficacy and safety of possible
    treatments. Though the proposed technology will initially target research studies
    to understand and treat all neurological conditions, it can be useful for automatic
    assessments of cells in all tissues, including cancer screening and diagnosis
    from biopsies. \n\n\nThe proposed project will develop and optimize an algorithm
    to help brain scientists identify causes and treatments for neurological disease
    and mental illness. The proposed technology will use deep learning (artificial
    intelligence) systems to automatically recognize, count and size brain cells on
    tissue sections. An important use of this technology will be to analyze brains
    and nerve tissue from mice and rats treated to show similar neurological diseases
    as those found in humans. These animal models provide a powerful tool for testing
    treatments to cure brain disease in humans. Currently stereology studies of tissues
    from these animals require a trained technician to sit before a computer screen
    making tedious manual counts of hundreds and thousands of microscopic cells. This
    outdated approach fails to take advantage of powerful deep learning methods proposed
    for the proposed software that could complete these tasks 10 times faster and
    with fewer errors and human biases. Therefore, the proposed technology will use
    deep learning technology to accelerate basic research and drug development in
    the U.S., thereby establishing a long-term economic engine and bringing significant

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to enable the discovery of needed antibody therapeutics in diseases for which there are no available treatments. These therapies act by increasing or decreasing the activity of a type of cell signaling receptor, "G protein-coupled receptors" (GPCRs). Antibodies are highly specific for their targets, an important characteristic for GPCR drugs, as GPCRs comprise a large family of structurally similar proteins.  In fact, small molecule drugs for GPCRs often are toxic due to side effects from acting on structurally similar but functionally unrelated GPCRs. This project will develop the first technology that directly identifies antibodies by their ability to modulate GPCR function. These antibodies will impact society's health by treating currently incurable diseases, and strongly impact scientific understanding by enabling the study of GPCR-related mammalian physiology and disease. The commercial impacts are potentially very large. The global GPCR drug market is over $100B, and over half of marketed antibody therapeutics have annual sales of over $1B. The platform described here has the potential to develop many GPCR antibody therapeutics, and thereby generate an enormous amount of value for patients, society at large, and co-development partners.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a platform for discovering GPCR-modulating antibodies. This platform could be critical for generating tools for studying GPCR-related biology and disease, and for developing therapeutics with fewer side effects than small molecule drugs to treat GPCR-related diseases. Developing functional GPCR antibodies using traditional methods is encumbered by the difficulty in producing antigens that represent the GPCR in a functional state, and a lack of high-throughput assays of GPCR function. The proposed platform and method expresses human GPCRs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast, couples activity to selectable phenotypes, and directly selects antibodies that modulate GPCR function in the same cells. The first objective aims to further characterize the activity and specificity of camelid antibodies ("nanobodies") antagonists that inhibit the endogenous yeast GPCR, Ste2, and then perform agonist selections to identify at least one Ste2 agonist. The second objective aims to further develop the platform to enable interrogating a broader array of human GPCR targets using ScFv antibody libraries, and to identify at least one agonist or antagonist of a therapeutically relevant human GPCR. Positive results will demonstrate the feasibility of the platform.

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to develop and test feasibility of a web-based
    software and machine learning technology that is able to empower healthcare teams
    with community resource information as well as facilitate coordination of post-treatment
    care. Lack of access to community resources such as housing, food and transportation
    (also known as social determinants of health) has been associated with negative
    health outcomes such as unplanned hospital readmissions and emergency room visits.
    This leads to high healthcare costs. Therefore, healthcare teams (i.e. social
    workers, case managers and discharge planners) spend a significant amount of time
    to locate appropriate community resources for their patients. Our innovation will
    leverage a community of healthcare professionals and the resource providers to
    ultimately find community resources for patients in a faster and less costly manner.
    The machine learning technology supported by this award will connect healthcare
    professionals with relevant community resources that ultimately reduces the cost
    and time associated with this process. A successful implementation of this technology
    will lead to improved post-treatment care outcomes for the patients and reduced

    healthcare professionals and resource providers to coordinate community resource
    sharing. A successful implementation of this algorithm will provide substantial
    improvements on the ability to acquire timely community resources as compared
    current methods. The goal of this research is to validate whether the machine

    Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project reflects the increasing importance
    and proliferation of artificial intelligence and algorithmic systems in the educational
    arena and in other domains of human resources. This places the project strategically
    at the vanguard of scientific discovery, in building a technology tool that will
    serve society?s goals. In the post-secondary education and training domains, market
    inefficiencies require excess spending on both sides of the transaction, adversely
    affecting both supply and demand. As the nation continues to deliberate the value
    of higher education in the face of $1.3 billion in student loan debt, streamlining
    the college application process by matching students and institutions based on
    an applicant?s career goals can reduce costs for students, their families, and
    institutions alike. Outside the field of education, this project will impact workplaces
    where employer-employee matching algorithms will be used in recruiting, hiring,
    training, and team building, across the domains of health, innovation, national
    defense, and beyond. Ultimately, people analytics platforms have unlimited potential
    for national and international commercialization, thus generating tax revenue,
    creating jobs, and otherwise bolstering the economy. \n \nThe proposed project
    focuses on the deployment of people analytics in the domain of college and career
    readiness and success. While talent evaluation through such innovative software
    is in its infancy, the small company's approach to college match will revolutionize
    how students identify their professional goals and then optimize their college
    experience for successful life launch. The small company's team of behavioral
    and data scientists, game designers, and software engineers, are creating video
    games that provide insights into a college applicant's career potential. Their
    platform captures massive amounts of micro-behavioral data -- how long players
    hesitate before making a move, persistence in the face of challenge or frustration,
    ability to parallel process -- to create a psychographic profile of the player's
    career-critical characteristics, including traits like competitiveness, extroversion,
    risk tolerance, and other enduring, personal traits difficult to discern through
    resumes and traditional, college application materials. Once a student's career
    objectives become clear, the company's proprietary recommendation engine suggests
    educational institutions and curricula best suited to attain the player?s career
    goals. In addition to expanding the game platform and collecting player data to
    develop and fine tune predictive algorithms, this project also will examine factors
    that influence a player's response to the insights and recommendations the platform
    provides. This work will investigate the impact of transparency, or \"scrutability\",
    of game-based assessments and implement visualization tools that promote the player's

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to use current research in the learning sciences to develop games that make middle school math engaging and relevant.  Middle school is a crucial time in a student's educational journey as it is the period at which their self-concept of ability becomes stable. Studies show that it is also the period at which students start getting disengaged with math and there is a marked increase in negativity towards math from sixth to eighth grade. According to the National Report Card, only about a third of 8th graders in US public schools, of over 3.6 million students, score at the proficient or above level in Math every year. The goal of this proposal is to implement and test the effectiveness of a scaffolded learning and teaching environment, called the 'Teachpad', that helps middle school students learn difficult math concepts. Multiple studies have indicated that students put more effort into learning when they have to teach someone else. This project will extend these studies and evaluate whether the teachpad increases student engagement and improves learning and long term retention of difficult math concepts.

    The proposed project uses a "teach to learn" framework in which students teach characters in a computer game how to solve specific problems and use the feedback that they receive from the characters to evaluate how well they have understood the concepts themselves. The teachpad uses natural language input, meaning that the students can enter their instruction in plain English and can explain the solution to the problem as they would to a friend or sibling. A semantic parser extracts the useful information from this input and feeds it to a machine learning algorithm to teach a game character how to solve the problem. A model of what the character has learned is also visible to the student who can see how their instruction is working when the character is trying to solve a test problem. This project will implement the teachpad for the order of operations, and will determine how it compares to traditional classroom practices. Data will be  collected in authentic educational environments, through observations and interviews to study student engagement and usability, and pretests and posttests (once after the treatment and once when students return from summer break) to evaluate learning outcomes and long term retention.

    The broader impact/ commercial potential of this project is to commercialize previous research in tensegrity robots for new markets in disaster rescue, surveillance, scientific monitoring, and STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) education. Future deaths by both victims and first responders in disaster rescue in unchartered risky environments could be prevented by utilizing semi-autonomous technology to explore the regions of disasters, provide surveillance to inform first responders, and assist in the rescue of victims until human first responders can arrive. Current autonomous vehicles can be ineffective in navigating surface obstacles and climbing steep slopes to reach areas of interest. Aerial operations may be limited to dropping supplies, which may not be beneficial if victims are immobile or unconscious. The goal is to drop the proposed shape-shifting robots from aerial vehicles, so that these mobile robots can reach previously difficult areas for effective emergency response. This proposed technology will have broader impact in use for scientific monitoring and surveillance as well. A secondary market will be for K-12 students, teachers, parents and roboticists with the potential to have large impact in STEM education.  Robot kits will be developed for educational applications that will meet new Next Generation Science Standards.

    The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will focus on de-risking prior research in the development of spherical tensegrity structures as a robotic platform for the proposed target applications. To meet market needs, the specifications need to include impact testing from a drop from an aerial vehicle along with ground travel requirements of slope, rubble and speed. New hardware and software will be designed to meet these specifications. The following three control algorithms and actuation schemes will be developed and evaluated for target specifications and tested in simulation and in hardware for locomotion (1) Multi-cable rolling motion on inclined surfaces, (2) Dynamic rolling using Model Predictive Control (MPC), and (3) Deep reinforcement learning. For applications where the terrain has been mapped, a (4) Generative path-planning algorithm will be developed. (5) Control mechanisms for the internal sphere of the robot will be developed so that the tensegrity robot will be able to manipulate and orient a payload of sensing equipment (e.g., camera, ultrasound, infrared, laser, spectrometer) while traveling on rough terrain. (6) Associated sensor validation, fusion and estimation techniques will be developed to meet the specifications. The results will be a proof-of-concept prototype that meets the target specifications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable students and trainees to take state-of-the-art robotics laboratory classes from anywhere in the world. The proposed learning system is aimed to be incorporated as online courses, with the potential of being attended by more than a million students. The addressable market represents hundreds of millions of dollars considering online courses, secondary schools and industrial training. Laboratory courses in colleges and high schools require students to be physically present next to the equipment. With the proposed remote robotics laboratory, students and trainees can take laboratory classes just turning on their mobile devices or computers. Most importantly, the students can conduct the laboratory tutorials anywhere across the globe and at any time. This technology can be transformative for accessing expensive laboratory equipment not present in many institutions or companies. The system we provide consists of a robotic device currently being used inside NASA robots. Therefore, students using the remote laboratory will learn the use of real-world, state-of-the-art equipment that can be highly valuable for their job careers in STEM fields.

    The proposed project will solve two key problems in online learning. First, no known commercially available laboratory online course exists that provides students remote hands-on experimentation. The second is that the same content is delivered to all students regardless of their current understanding level. Distributed communications, robotic software and web framework technologies will be integrated to provide access to state-of-the-art laboratory equipment. The second key innovation is the delivery of content adaptively tailored to individual needs. The innovation, consists of three key components. A web framework that connects equipment to servers and personal mobile devices, an intelligent content tutoring system, scheduling usage times and student evaluation regarding skill acquisition and assessments. The team anticipates that being remotely located will be slightly less effective than being next to the equipment but superior than learning theory only.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop an easy to use internet-of-things (IoT) platform, called "Bluebird", for use in K-12 Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) education. This project will employ a craft-oriented approach to STEM education, which breaks down gender barriers and engages students from diverse backgrounds.  It is estimated that 65% of primary school children will grow up to work in jobs that do not yet exist. This new workforce will be the result of what is being referred to as the "fourth industrial revolution", brought on by a fusion of technologies in the physical, digital, and biological spheres. The goal of this project is to develop an ecosystem of IoT technologies that prepare students for these industries. The platform to be developed will disrupt the current commercial landscape by providing an affordable and student-friendly alternative to devices which are either expensive or overly challenging for beginners to adopt.  The resulting product platform will serve the global smart education and learning market, which is expected to grow to $586 billion by 2021.

    The intellectual merit of this project is to develop a "smart" education tool that will enable educators and learners to control the ways in which technology shapes their lives. This innovation will eliminate the major hurdles that create conceptual, practical, and economic barriers for students to gain literacy of information networks and human-centered design.  To achieve this goal, the team will research and develop a platform and an easy-to-use device that overcomes the technical challenges of providing IoT experiences in the classroom, where wireless internet is often unreliable, and the security and privacy of students must be safeguarded.  The key objectives for this project are 1) to develop a classroom-ready framework for IoT including curriculum that adheres to educational mandates; 2) to design and build low-cost and low-power hardware, firmware, and protocols for the platform; and 3) to design and implement a mobile application to facilitate communications and programming.  The anticipated result of this research is a platform that provides K-12 classroom access to IoT tools and skills. The design and manufacture of this project opens up a new market as Bluebird users craft their own IoT ideas, products, and services.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the first time commercial development of a copper cable which can transmit and store energy. Currently, copper cables are used for transmitting electricity. Adding energy storage capability to these cables is transformative and has the potential to be employed in a myriad of electrical and electronic applications. Making these cables into spools of wires and custom sliced into a certain length to achieve a required capacitance will be very attractive to commercial applications. The proposed study enables to understand how energy transmission and storage can be simultaneously performed without mutual interference. These cables can find niche applications in the automotive, energy, defense, and IT industries. Moreover, when made into thin wires, it can be weaved into a matrix which can be used to charge wearable devices. For example, currently, a soldier carries about 30-40 pounds of battery for a three-day mission. However, if energy storage devices like the one proposed here can be made into an advanced textile form and can be worn as a uniform, the weight currently carried by the soldiers can be considerably reduced. A cable energy storage device developed can also be beneficial for storing energy for clean-energy technologies such as wind and solar.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project fills the gap of a cable-type capacitor which saves space and fits well with electrical and electronic devices. The objective of this proposal is to use nanotechnology-based fabrication techniques to grow nanowhiskers with a high surface area on a copper cable to make cable-type capacitors. These nanostructures considerably enhance the surface area necessary for the storage of electrical charges. Since nanostructures are developed only on the outside of the electrical cable to store energy, the inner part of the cable can still be used for electrical transmission. The focus of the proposed research is to develop the processes which can be used to make these nanostructured electrodes into a cable capacitor. The fabrication techniques for growing nanostructures will be so designed that making long lengths of the cables are feasible. The performance of the cable-based capacitors will be tested in terms of capacitance, cycle life, voltage output, etc. In addition, the flexibility of the cable will be tested at different bend-angles to evaluate its applications in flexible energy storage applications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project include enabling the minimally invasive treatment of a large variety of conditions. This is expected to be achieved through the development of a steerable needle that can reach arbitrary positions in the human body that are not reachable by a straight needle from a simple needle hole. The long term impact of the proposed technology is in targeted delivery of medicine, or the removal of tissue such as biopsies, or treatment mechanisms such as ablation devices. An overarching goal of the proposed project is the availability of minimally invasive procedures that can replace more drastic surgery options. The development of this device has the potential to also save lives, treating what otherwise would be inoperable conditions due to the location of tumors blocked by sensitive organs or bones.


    The proposed project, if successful, will lead to demonstrating the application of a device that utilizes the buckling behavior of semi-curved beams to controllably alter the stiffness in a needle for cancer treatment and measure its efficacy in terms of the advantages over straight needles. The objectives of this research include: developing a prototype and match to surgeon use cases (interventional radiologist) and testing and characterizing the steerability performance while delivering the medical payload. Specifically, it is expected that the first therapeutic application of this technology will be microwave ablation of cancer tumors.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is that it will enable the automated harvesting of fragile produce such as strawberries to help offset a shrinking workforce and increased labor costs. The world population is expected to grow from 7.3 billion to 11.2 billion by 2100, this population growth and a rising middle class will place more demand on the agricultural industry. Presently, the agricultural industry relies solely on manual labor to harvest its fragile produce. There is no mechanized option that can reliably and cost effectively harvest these crops. Consequently, the industry is struggling to harvest its crop, maintain quality and control its costs. High quality and lower costs can only be maintained if robotic harvesters are utilized that can pick fragile produce without damage. One of the key elements on the automated harvester is a gripper that can grab and pick the produce without damage. There is a market for a reliable and low cost robotic gripper that can gently pick and handle strawberries and other fragile produce.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project involves the development of a robotic end effector that can be used to harvest and handle fragile produce. Advances in machine vision and robotics has made it possible to commercially harvest fragile produce such as strawberries, however, the key component that still needs to be developed is an end effector that can pick the fruit without damage and be reliable and cost effective. Design and development of this end effector will use a new and novel method for grabbing the strawberry with advances in design, materials and actuation. The proposed R&D plan will involve repeated testing of the interaction between the fruit and the end effector. Analytical studies using a series of thin film load sensors mounted on the end effector will provide real time load profiles that can be used to optimize the design and performance of the end effector. Shelf life testing of the fruit will be used to assess the success of the end effector in properly picking and handling the fruit without damage.

    This STTR Phase I project will develop 3D printed liquid hydrogen fuel tanks for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). UAVs are currently powered by long endurance low reliability gasoline engines, or short endurance highly reliable electric propulsion. Hydrogen fuel cells offer the potential for long endurance highly reliable propulsion if the proper hydrogen storage method is used. Through the innovative hydrogen storage system developed by this project, fuel cell electric vehicles can advance national health and welfare through reduction of emissions, and promotion of energy independence both on the ground and in the air. This project will develop a new class of liquid hydrogen storage tanks for electric UAVs that will increase the reliability and performance of surveillance platforms in the armed forces, reducing risk to American service personnel while they secure the defense of our nation. The same electric platforms will promote the national welfare by enabling the inspection of key energy and transportation infrastructure and serving as intelligence and communications platforms for first responders during natural disasters. In addition, the key technology developed in this project will expand the utility of additive manufacturing by demonstrating the capabilities and performance of engineered plastics in cryogenic (< -238°F) environments. Such cryogenic rated 3D printed polymer parts have wide ranging impacts, including cost reduction, across cryogenic dependent technology areas from medical devices and spacecraft to drug and food processing.

    Additively manufactured polymers have never been used in cryogenic applications until now. The correct selection of polymer blend, testing and selection of a lightweight impermeable membrane, and thermal characterization of novel insulation materials are critical to project success.  Since most cryogenic research, such as -423°F permeation of hydrogen through polymers, has not been studied since the 1960s, extensive cryogenic engineering and testing experience is required to apply modern materials and manufacturing methods to the project. The objectives of this project will fill knowledge gaps by testing metallized polymer films for hydrogen permeability, as well as manufacturing methods to cost effectively apply it to insulation panels or tank walls. While prior research has identified a polymer blend that is robust to cryogenic thermal cycling, the possibility of microcracking has not yet been thoroughly addressed and will be evaluated in this project. Novel insulation materials never before used in commercial cryogenic applications will be thermally characterized and integrated into the prototype tank. This project will conclude by completing a liquid hydrogen fuel fill and measuring the mass boil-off rate to test computational fluid dynamic modeled performance.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in enabling additional energy savings in buildings by harvesting natural daylight and using it for illuminating the interior space with high efficiency and without glare, thus offsetting the need for electrical lighting. This will make building operations more sustainable and help improve the energy security of the U.S, create jobs, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, when commercially available, this new technology will bring all of the well-known benefits of enhanced natural lighting for occupants of millions of residential and commercial buildings across the U.S., such as connection to outdoors and improved comfort, productivity and well-being, thus benefiting many groups of consumers.

    The proposed project will demonstrate the feasibility of a novel, non-prismatic optical film material and its use for enhanced daylighting harvesting in buildings. This material employs thousands of microscopic reflective surfaces embedded into the bulk of the material and operates by capturing the incident sunlight and projecting it deep into the building interior. Commercial buildings alone consume about 20 percent of all energy used in the United States at an estimated cost of nearly $180 billion. Building interior lighting accounts for around 30% of that cost. By applying the daylight-harvesting optical material to windows of building facades, a significant fraction of that energy consumption can be offset using the natural light captured throughout the day. The project will provide the critical design, testing, and experimental validation needed to transition the technology into the commercial sector. The primary objective of the project is to develop the core light-redirecting material and associated micro-optical fabrication technology that can be subsequently scaled for low-cost mass production. A second objective is to develop, test and demonstrate a prototype daylight-harvesting window film product based on this material.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project will be the development of sensor-embedded "smart" drinkware (i.e., stirrers, straws and cups) to actively alert consumers prior to consumption of a "spiked" beverage, and thus provide a proactive way to prevent drug-facilitated sexual assault.  This sensor technology is based on "smart" molecularly imprinted color-changing nanomaterials that eliminate the need to run tedious sample preparation and analysis procedures using conventional laboratory instrument.  The use of a colorimetric sensor as a cost-effective consumer sensor has far broader applications than just date rape drug detection, including applications where on-the-spot detection could help protect consumers from other harmful chemicals, pathogens, drugs, explosives, nerve agents, allergens, etc. In addition, this project will advance colorimetric sensing technology using structural color into a robust and rapid sensing platform for drug monitoring with high sensitivity, response time, and accuracy.


    This STTR Phase I project proposes to develop a platform technology based on a highly accurate, color-changing sensor that will initially be used to continuously monitor a beverage for date rape drugs, and instantaneously detect these adulterants if they are present. Drug-facilitated sexual assault has become a significant issue, but there is currently no drug-sensing drinkware available on the market. This drug sensor will be implemented using highly selective molecular imprinted polymers as target drug receptors and non-toxic color-changing nanomaterials as signaling reporters. The scope of the research includes the rational design of the color-changing nanomaterial used as a signaling reporter for the target drug binding event, the development of a highly selective molecularly imprinted polymer and its integration with reporters, and the testing of the color-changing sensor under different matrices and conditions to verify its sensitivity and specificity.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve the lives of over 500,000 patients with end stage renal disease receiving thrice-weekly hemodialysis treatments in the US each year.  Hemodialysis requires the blood of a patient to be removed and passed through a filter for cleaning prior to returning it to the patient. Oftentimes patients receive insufficient dialysis treatments because the traditional blood pathways cannot be effectively sustained. This leads to increased infections, hospitalization rates and deaths. In addition to the unnecessary suffering of patients, the cost of maintaining these blood pathways is over $2B annually. This implantable device will improve our technical and scientific understanding of hemodialysis shortcomings and may lead to advancing the knowledge in medical fields related to arterial and venous access.  This innovation will allow enhanced hemodialysis treatments for this vulnerable patient population by maintaining blood pathways and lowering infection rates.

    The proposed project is to create a vascular access device which ensures that end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients have reliable vascular access without the need for an arterialized venous system. AV fistulas and AV grafts often fail to mature and are associated with suboptimal long-term patency rates resulting in a loss of the patient?s life line to dialysis. The objective would be to create a completely subcutaneous device which can be anastomosed to an artery and a separate vein such that the arterial device can obtain a blood flow of at least 400ml/min and the venous device can return the dialyzed blood at a rate of at least 400 ml/min.  The device must allow blood flow through its lumen only when needed and return the native vasculature to its normal flow state after each use. The technical difficulty is how to configure the mechanics of the device and its anastomosis to blood vessels in a manner which allows it to be opened and closed on demand without causing thromboses to form within the native vessels or device. We will be using computational fluid dynamic modeling and an iterative design process to achieve our prototype.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project will be to develop engineered bacteria with the ability to oxidize the copper mineral chalcopyrite and gold.  The majority of copper reserves are in chalcopyrite, which currently requires smelting.  The US copper mining industry, due to regulatory restrictions, has a limited smelting capacity forcing US copper manufacturers to ship copper mineral concentrates overseas for smelting, which incurs additional transportation and processing costs while losing up to 30% of the full value of the metal to the smelters. At over 400,000 tons of copper concentrate exported annually, this amounts to over $600M in lost value.  In gold mining, biooxidation is increasingly used before other gold recovery techniques are utilized, and increased oxidation rates would expand the use and significantly lower the capital and operating costs of this practice.  In addition, enhanced oxidation would accelerate the development of mining waste streams as biotechnology feedstocks.  This project potentially furthers more economical and sustainable biohydrometallurgical techniques throughout the mining industry.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes the demonstration and development of new oxidation activity within bioleaching microbes, expanding the applications of biohydrometallurgy in metal mining. This would permit the application of cheaper, low impact biohydrometallurgical methods for important metal minerals. Currently, biohydrometallurgy is limited by its reliance on ferric iron as the main oxidant. The Intellectual Merit of this proposal stems from the use of hydrogen peroxide, which can enable mineral oxidation conversions and rates that are not obtainable with ferric iron alone. Adding hydrogen peroxide to biohydrometallurgy operations is not feasible or cost effective, however, the genetic engineering of biomining microbes, such as A. ferrooxidans, to produce hydrogen peroxide would be a potentially game changing advance. This innovation will result in the production of biomining microbial cells with an unprecedented ability to dissolve sulfide-rich ores leading to the expansion of biohydrometallurgical approaches in the mining industry.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to enable drones to autonomously fly close to both outdoor and indoor infrastructure and assets, such as bridges, tunnels, buildings and warehouse goods, and to inspect them without relying on human pilots, external markers, and availability and reliability of data from a Global Positioning System (GPS). Many assets, such as bridges and warehouses, require drones to fly in GPS-denied environments making it impossible for existing systems to do localization and perform autonomous flights. The proposed technology will allow for faster, more frequent and thorough, less expensive and safer inspections, enhancing public confidence in the use of transportation assets. The proposed technology will also reduce the number of injuries caused by manual inspections, because of personnel having to access hard-to-reach or dangerous locations, lowering insurance and health care costs. Federal and state resources that would have been spent on inspection and maintenance could then be reallocated to other initiatives. In the case of bridge inspection, the proposed technology will eliminate the need for costly lane and bridge closures. The global opportunity to create savings, enhance safety and reduce externalities in infrastructure and warehouse inspection markets by using autonomous drone technology is substantial.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will involve developing an onboard, autonomous and reliable Advanced Perceptive Navigation system for drones to perform bridge, warehouse and other infrastructure and asset inspection by flying close to assets under challenging conditions including GPS-denied environments. Existing drone technology heavily relies on GPS data and drones can only be safely flown tens, if not hundreds, of meters away from the asset due to lack of precise control by human pilots and lack of positional accuracy of commercial autopilots. Such distances are inadequate for many situations, which require high-resolution imagery. The proposed solution will not rely on a global geographic frame of reference, but instead sense and perceive features of the asset that will allow the drone to navigate and optimally position itself with respect to the asset to collect images. Robust and computationally efficient algorithms will be developed, to be run onboard in real-time, for object detection, feature extraction and reliable tracking of points of interest from cameras and depth sensors mounted on drones. Developed algorithms will be integrated with the actual drone platform, and indoor test flights as well as field testing will be performed.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be to help control nutrient contaminants in soil and water for the benefit of the world?s population, by providing sustainable access to safe drinking water. The estimated national economic cost of nitrogen pollution in drinking water is $19 billion annually, while the cost to freshwater ecosystems is $78 billion per year. Traditional water-quality monitoring practices are based on "grab-samples" that are sent for laboratory analyses that may take days to weeks to be completed.  Similar traditional approaches are found in agriculture where excessive application of nitrate-based fertilizers may result in agricultural runoff that carries pollution to ground and surface water sources. The proposed high-performance, low-cost optical sensor technology will enable deployment of a dense real-time monitoring network in freshwater sources, water treatment facilities, and farms, and will gain a significant foothold in the $6.8B global water quality monitoring equipment market. In the event of natural disasters, integration of the proposed nitrate sensor will be useful in assessment of water quality in local water resources, providing communities with real-time information on water safety.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project focuses on the development of a non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) detector for real-time monitoring of nitrate concentration in water. This effort will combine nitrate-selective ion-exchange membrane technology with today's low-cost infrared (IR) components for the design of a new type of sensor targeting applications in aqueous environment. The proposed technology relies on infrared optical fibers for signal transmission. Currently, the use of commercial real-time optical nitrate sensors, based on ultra-violet (UV) absorption, is limited due to the optical interferences in the UV spectra related to the inorganic and organic substances, and reduced UV transmission caused by turbidity. The proposed proprietary IR technology is designed to overcome these shortcomings through implementation of smart membrane filtering. The instrument will provide high frequency data collection in dynamic aqueous environments with a wide sensitivity range (1 to 100 ppm). This technology can be further expanded for measurement of additional nutrients and contaminants, making it a robust tool for water quality assessment.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to revolutionize the healthcare industry by developing computing solutions for precision medicine.  Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) now produces a large amount of genome data at an affordable cost. Analyzing large volumes of genome data from diverse populations will lead to a better understanding of the causes of various diseases ranging from cancer to rare genetic disorders, and develop better cures. By sequencing a patient's genome, it is possible to more specifically determine his/her condition and devise an individualized treatment plan. And, if every newborn's genome was sequenced, it would allow for proactive identification of disease risks, and early intervention. Understanding viruses and bacteria will help us gain a better understanding of infectious diseases, and thereby enable us to develop better immunization and disease control methods. In addition to health-care, genomics also may help engineer better food crops and attain food security.  This project will develop novel computing hardware solutions that are customized for genomics sequencing software. These computing solutions can help realize an exponential growth in the digital genomics market and bring affordable personalized medicine to all.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to accelerate Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) by building a customized processor for genomics automata.  Over the last decade, the production cost of sequencing has plummeted from ten million dollars to a thousand dollars, and is soon expected to go below a hundred dollars per genome. Advancements in processor performance, however, have not kept pace. It can take several days on a computing cluster to sequence a genome. For genome sequencing to become as affordable as a routine medical test, computing solutions are required that can sequence a genome in minutes, and cost only a few dollars per genome. This project is developing a novel ASIC hardware accelerator for computing finite state automata, which supports approximate string matching, a computational kernel widely used in genomics applications such as sequencing. The design is based on a novel in-memory hardware technology for efficiently implementing state transitions. The goal is the improve efficiency of genomics automata by two orders of magnitude compared to modern processors.

    This SBIR Phase I project will study the development of a digitally configurable shape around which a shoe can be created. The results of this project will enable the mass-customization of shoes so they can precisely fit the feet of the individuals who wear them. Properly fitting shoes are intended to improve the quality of life of customers through reduced pain and improved musculoskeletal health. This development in shoe-making technology is of broad interest to the population of the United States, but particularly important to women, who often suffer from physical deformities and injuries caused by ill-fitting shoes. The proposed innovation relies on mass-customization methods and flexible robotics technology. Its anticipated success will provide additional jobs in the shoe industry and related fields, and improve productivity nationwide through reduced healthcare costs.


    The strong technical innovation in this project will be the adaptation of granular jamming technology for use in programmable shape technology. The driving goal of the proposed project is to develop a last for use in the mass-customization of shoes that is capable of changing shape in response to a digital representation of the customer's foot shape. After changing shape, it will lock into a rigid but smooth form appropriate for use in traditional shoe manufacturing methods. The scope of the research will cover the development of the last in a manner appropriate for use in manufacturing conditions (in terms of both physical and temperature durability) and the creation and implementation of algorithms for transforming foot shape data into an appropriately fitting shoe shape and for transforming a standard shoe pattern onto an arbitrary foot shape. Iterative design practices and just-in-time manufacturing techniques will facilitate the development of this new technology and manufacturing methodology.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project objective is to overcome weaknesses of current composite materials due to delamination and develop composites with more than 100% improvement in interlaminar toughness. The project aims to accelerate the innovation of epoxy/resin nanoadditives for composite materials in order to solve this problem. Composites are expected to be the fastest growing application segment in the global epoxy resin market, with an estimated compounded annual growth rate of ~6% and an expected market value of $14.5 billion by 2024. The key drivers in the market are the end-use industries which include aerospace, automotive, transportation, and coatings. There is a critical need to make these materials safer and more reliable by increasing their low velocity impact resistance, and to increase the adhesion between laminar layers. The product could have an obtainable market volume of $36 million in the US alone by 2021.

    The intellectual merit of this project is in the development of new hybrid nanofillers based on Graphene Oxide (GO) and Polyhedral Oligomeric Silsesquioxane (POSS). These nanofillers can be added to epoxy/vinyl ester/polyester matrices through a "Master Batch" process to enhance the interlaminar fracture toughness of commercial composites. This increase in fracture toughness can be more than 100% at extremely low addition levels (~0.2% by weight of the composite) without any changes in current manufacturing processes. Nanofillers such as carbon nanotubes and nanoclays are difficult to add to composite matrices because of their tendency to agglomerate and result in poor dispersion, apart from major changes in current manufacturing practices. Preliminary experiments have demonstrated that it is possible to develop these hybrid nanofillers based on GO and POSS that can be added to composite matrices with excellent dispersion in composite industry standard solvents. The challenges of dispersion are overcome through hybridization and Master Batching. Characterization of the cured Master Batches as well as measurement of physical properties of sample composites will be carried out to optimize the nanofiller content and the processing parameters.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is a healthier honeybee population to increase food security. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization, annual production must increase by 60% from 2007 to produce enough food for an estimated 9.1 billion people by 2050, which will be impossible without honeybee pollination (Food and Agriculture Organization, 2012). Honeybee populations have declined precipitously for the past 60 years?a total loss of 3 million hives (National Agricultural Statistics Service, 2007). Annual hive losses cost the U.S. economy $2 billion (National Agricultural Statistics Service, 2016; The White House, 2014). This project aims to enhance scientific understanding of the problem by finding practical solutions to hive loss for beekeepers, advancing IoT applications in beekeeping, and automating data analysis for beekeepers. Researchers and experts suspect the declines are due to multiple factors, but research is limited by a lack of technology tracking the hives on a large scale. Researchers' inability to perform analysis on a large, diverse dataset has obstructed their ability to draw conclusions on causes of hive loss and drive innovation on traditional beekeeping methods. 

    This proposed project will advance Internet of Things applications in beekeeping by automating data analysis for beekeepers through algorithm building. Several studies built models to describe actions inside the hive. However, these are built on limited data or are theoretical. Henry et al., 2016 mentioned the need for predictive algorithms to be expanded to larger data sets to reduce hive loss. Data driven beekeeping is in its infancy as an industry, but based on the success in the AgTech space, data monitoring will be a necessary step in solving colony health problems. The project will take a database of over 4,000 hives to improve research models for practical monitoring. This database will be paired with sensor and monitoring data from project hives. Through the project hives the company will confirm the sensor quality for commercialization. The company will create a baseline model of a healthy hive to detect anomalies. These anomalies will be worked into a predictive model to detect problems related to pests and diseases in the hive. The company will look for broad detection of a threatened hive, then drill down into specific problems (like Varroa mites). These finds will be included in monitoring products offered to beekeepers.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes a new, low-cost approach to 3D millimeter wave image sensors enabling non-destructive evaluation in construction, as well as other fields such as robotics, security, and quality control. Millimeter wave imaging uses human-safe, radio frequency signals to make high resolution images of objects that cannot be seen with conventional optical sensors. Because of their long wavelength, millimeter waves pass through many materials that are opaque to visible light, including common construction materials such as drywall, brick, tile, cement, and wood. For example, in the construction market, dramatic cost savings and faster, safer, and more accurate construction work could be achieved using millimeter wave imaging for structural evaluation as well as observing hidden utilities such as wiring and plumbing that should be avoided while drilling, and detecting hazards such as water leaks behind wall surfaces. This project will also provide entrepreneurial opportunity to a new generation of scholars/innovators as the technology matures toward commercial practice.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to advance the state of the art in millimeter wave imaging and enable low-cost, standalone 3D millimeter wave imagers. Prior work in a laboratory environment has demonstrated the promise of millimeter wave imaging for applications such as structural analysis in construction, however commercialization requires an image sensor that is fast, portable, low power, and low cost. This project will enable low cost hardware/software platforms for millimeter wave imaging using commercial chipsets with novel general purpose graphics processing unit (GPGPU)-accelerated image reconstruction algorithms.

    This SBIR Phase I project develops chemical tools and platforms to produce valuable chemical building blocks that can be used to produce synthetically challenging compounds on large scales. These compounds belong to the class of polypropionates which is known for its diverse and powerful biological activities across multiple indications within the pharmaceutical, agrochemical, and veterinary industries. The high impact of the polypropionate class is hampered by the inefficiencies of current chemical processes to fully tackle their complex structures. Importantly, the lack of scalability adds another severe complication to the development process. To fully unlock the potential of this class, improved chemistries with greater efficiencies are required to successfully identify high impact candidates for further development. Moreover, the new tools are excellent substrates for polyketide?{enhanced drug discovery. This project is a prelude to the development of a novel class of compounds against rare and unmet needs in cancer in collaboration with the NCI/NIH. Such cancers pose a huge burden on the healthcare system and the economy in general. Inspired by the NSF mission, this project describes an innovative chemical process that can deliver highly valuable compounds. Such an approach will enable accelerated discoveries across multiple medicinal and agrochemical needs.

    This project aims to provide all sixteen possible stereotetrad building blocks (in the form of chiral lactones) for construction of polypropionates on practical scales. Those chiral building blocks can serve as common precursors for synthesis of polypropionates, as tools for rational design and structure activity relationship (SAR) studies, or as entries for more diverse and complex library of analogs. The chemistry platform used to produce those building blocks is referred to as the Chiral Carbon Catalog (CCC). The CCC platform is a synthetic tool box that allows stereoselective large scale economic synthesis of various complex polypropionate building blocks from simple starting materials. The unified process has been carefully designed to employ highly diastereoselective substrate directed transformations while avoiding expensive and impractical chiral auxiliary overheads or expensive catalysts. The high efficiencies of transformations allow the elimination of tedious and expensive purifications such as column chromatography. The crystalline natures of key intermediates enable facile production on scale and allow the synthetic routes used by the platform to be easily adopted by the industry for large scale production. This ensures adequate supply of those building blocks for development of complex chiral products within several industries (e.g. pharmaceutical and agrochemical fields).

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to reduce the power consumption of display and lighting products by 90%. It will do so by enabling the pervasive use of light emitting diodes (LEDs) in such products. LEDs consume substantially less power than other display/lighting technologies and also offer benefits such as superior picture or lighting quality and longer lifespan. The foremost barrier to the emergence of such products is the difficulty of economically placing large quantities of LEDs onto a product grid. For example, if current-day methods are used to create a full high definition display, its assembly would take about a month and drive its cost far beyond what the market could accept. This project's innovation addresses this problem with a laser-based, ultra-high speed LED placement solution. Beyond this immediate application, it will further the industry's technical capabilities relative to electronics component assembly in general. The commercial potential for chip-based LED display and lighting products is expected to reach about $10 billion within five years. The market for LED placement solutions in support of these products will be about $1 billion in this same time frame.

    The proposed project addresses the above problem by demonstrating an ultra-high speed LED placement method that can reduce the one month assembly time in the example above to just one minute. This solution, unlike others in development, increases the placement rate of LEDs by a factor of 10,000 and includes the ability to pre-screen and replace non-functional LEDs. This project will demonstrate the core aspect of this solution involving the placement of multiple, very small LEDs ("microLEDs") using a single laser pulse diffracted into multiple scanned beams. It will use this solution to demonstrate the extremely fast assembly of a quantum dot-based microLED display. The project will build upon a related, previously demonstrated capability applied to larger, silicon dies. Each aspect of the technology (wafer preparation, single laser beam placement, multi-beam placement) will be individually optimized for the new conditions imposed by the smaller sized, sapphire-based microLEDs. This new, LED-tailored capability will then be used to demonstrate the assembly of a four thousand pixel microLED display in under one second thereby achieving the project's goal of demonstrating a >50M units/hour LED placement rate.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve health and save lives while addressing a market opportunity of over a billion dollars per year. Worldwide particulate matter air pollution is responsible for nearly as many deaths as cancer, and more than malaria and AIDS combined. The goal of the project is an inexpensive, consumer market air pollution sensor that offers performance comparable to laboratory instruments that cost hundreds to thousands of dollars. The proposed technology has important societal benefit as it will help mitigate the negative health effects of air pollution in the environment, home, and workplace. The proposed project contributes to scientific knowledge and understanding by investigating novel particulate matter analysis techniques and enabling a highly-sensitive, portable, and low-cost monitor for studies of air pollution. With the form-factor of a AA-battery, it is the only particulate matter air pollution sensor that can fit in devices like the Amazon Echo or Google Nest. Markets for the sensor include smart homes, smart cities, green buildings, automobile cabin monitoring, air purifiers, industrial hygiene, and others. 

    The proposed project will investigate a novel sensor for monitoring particulate matter air pollution. Existing air pollution monitors are expensive, large, and power hungry. The monitors on the consumer market use optical techniques that provide only a proxy estimate of pollution levels and are unable to detect ultrafine particulates which have diameters smaller than 100 nanometers. These ultrafine particulates pose serious health risks. The sensor of this work employs thermophoretic deposition of airborne particulates from a sample stream onto an acoustic wave resonator, and determines the mass deposited by measuring the frequency shift of a sustaining electronic oscillator circuit. The monitor of this work detects particulates from a few microns in diameter to ultrafine, and provides a true mass concentration measurement of the pollution, which is acknowledged as the industry gold-standard. Key activities of the proposal include the development of innovative techniques to collect and analyze particulates and to improve the sensor stability and lifetime. Anticipated technical results include enhanced monitor longevity, improved level of detection, improved manufacturability, and a significant reduction in power consumption. Coupling the sensor to a cell-phone or other wireless device would enable dense temporal and spatial wireless air quality measurements.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project will be a cost-effective, commercially viable, alternative process for on-site treatment of food waste and energy recovery.  In the U.S., nearly 40% of food is wasted with $165 billion equivalent loss of food plus associated water, energy, chemicals, and labor used in food production.  Disposal of the food waste involves additional costs and causes environmental pollution, e.g. rotting food waste in landfills accounts for a large portion of U.S. methane emissions, a powerful greenhouse gas.  Moreover, food waste streams contain a substantial amount of chemical energy that also is lost by its disposal.  Recovering energy in food waste in the form of biofuel and chemicals, as proposed in this project, will provide efficient management of food waste problem reducing food waste disposal costs while producing useful products.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to develop and demonstrate the performance of a novel, immobilized clostridia cell membrane bioreactor-based continuous process to convert food waste to butanol.  The conventional stirred-tank fermentation reactor-based food waste conversion process exhibits low butanol concentration as well as productivity.  The proposed process will address the technical barriers of the conventional process by immobilizing the clostridia cells on porous media to dramatically increase cell culture density, and, consequently, butanol productivity and conversion efficiency.  In addition, by separating butanol from the reaction media, recycled butanol concentration is minimized in the reactor, which alleviates butanol toxicity.  The membrane fouling issues in biomass separation will be addressed by an "open channel" membrane module design to separate and recycle biomass to the bioreactor.  The energy requirement for recovery of butanol from dilute reactor effluent will be reduced by an order of magnitude over the conventional distillation by using a pervaporation membrane.  The objective of the proposed effort is to demonstrate a steady state continuous integrated process for converting food waste to butanol after optimizing individual components.

    a great demand for in-situ chemical sensor technology with ability to (1) Measure
    with high resolution the environmental footprint of agricultural and urban development,
    and (2) Identify potential safety issues related to drinking water quality. High
    concentrations of nutrients (e.g. nitrate, nitrite, orthophosphate) in surface
    waters are the source of environmental, public health, and economic issues. Active
    monitoring of nutrient concentrations in surface waters such as estuaries, lakes
    and rivers is critical in assessing their health and implementing timely action
    to minimize ecosystem degradation. This SBIR project aims at developing a disruptive
    new type of highly miniaturized autonomous water quality chemical sensor, that
    can be operated remotely and autonomously, has minimal installation and maintenance
    requirements, is capable of performing thousands of measurements directly in-situ,
    in both reagent-based and reagent-less configuration, on a single battery charge.
    Applications that will greatly benefit from such sensors range from scientific
    research, to estimating nutrient loads, establishing discharge limits, predicting
    eutrophication conditions and demonstrating compliance with regulatory reporting
    requirements. Independently, the drinking water industry has its own requirements
    for autonomous chemical sensors for monitoring reservoirs and distribution networks,
    optimizing treatment processes and identifying tank nitrification issues early-on.
    \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to achieve
    the highest level of miniaturization and functionality attempted in a commercial
    water quality sensor. The core innovation of this proposed e-CHEM system is in
    the microfluidic chemical analysis module, combining a novel highly-efficient
    mixing mechanism to homogenize minute volumes of reagent with the fluid sample
    with a microfluidic implementation of dual reagent-based and reagent-less chemical
    measurement capability, the possibility of controlling relevant chemical reactions
    in-situ via precise on-chip temperature management, and finally the potential
    of overcoming the important hurdle of bio-fouling via novel surface nano-engineering.
    The parameters measured will include a selection from: ortho-phosphates, nitrites,
    nitrates, dissolved organic carbon, total and/or free chlorine, free ammonia,
    and pH. The system will include bidirectional wireless telemetry to enable automatic
    alert generation and data transmission to remote servers for visualization, analysis
    and interpretation. Target accuracy and response times are superior to traditional
    measurement techniques due to full process automation, elimination of sample degradation
    and transit times, reduction of human error, and automatic data centralization."

    Research (SBIR) project is to develop specialized cell culture plates that can

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is the development of potentially the first FDA-approved phage therapeutic, non-antibiotic remedy specifically designed for honeybees. This treatment has the potential to become the global gold standard for treating American Foulbrood, a devastating honey bee disease caused by the bacteria Paenibacillus larvae, which threatens 2.7 million beehives in the United States and 92.5 million beehives worldwide. The American foulbrood treatment market opportunity is $500 M, and this technology promises a significant reduction of current unprecedented mortality rates of honeybees, curtailment of antibiotics being used in beehives, which perpetuates antibiotic resistance in the environment, and support for organic agricultural production.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to expand the collection of Paenibacillus larvae bacterial strains for novel phage therapy development, enlarge the library of P. larvae bacteriophages from which an optimized treatment can be created, and test against each other to determine the optimal therapeutic phage combination. The expansion of the P. larvae strain and phages collection is critical because of the high specificity phages have for their hosts. Samples of P. larvae and phage will be collected from the entire United States. These greatly expanded phage and bacteria collections will help to ensure that treatments will be developed to effectively treat any American foulbrood infection.

    This SBIR Phase I project creates an online integrated training program that combines problem solving and app development. Trainees will be able to create mobile apps to address challenges facing their own communities. Mobile apps have become key to addressing many pain points. Currently, skilled developers work with customers to understand problems and create applications to solve problems. Unfortunately, this restricts app creation to those that have access to development resources and understand problem solving techniques. The platform created in this project will democratize access to app development by giving problem solving and app development skills to high school students. Thus, it presents an opportunity to every citizen to create apps that can address their own or their community's challenges. This opportunity can have a transformational impact particularly on underprivileged communities where people have very little access to resources. Mobile app development is also a skill that has the potential for significant income generation opportunity. At the end of the training, students will be certified for their problem solving and app generation skill ability. High school students who have certification to prove their problem solving and App Development skills become highly valued employees in the work force of the future.

    This project creates a drag-and-drop tool that allows anyone to be able to create smartphone applications, as well as an online portal that explains how to use the platform. The app creation tool will allow users to (1) develop a smartphone app for multiple operating systems; (2) live test their apps on their mobile devices; (3) download their completed apps onto their personal devices; and (4) publish their apps to the app store of their choosing. The online learning platform will deliver multimedia content to teach and enable users across the country to be able to build mobile applications on this platform. The world's mobile population is expected to reach 5.7 billion people by 2020, yet only a very small number of these users are expected to be able program these devices. Thus, this project looks to build a tool that lowers the barrier to building mobile smartphone apps via a drag-and-drop interface, as well as educate users on how to use this tool.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to develop a new class of cancer therapeutics that involves the re-directing of the body's pre-existing immune response obtained through previous childhood vaccination to target tumor cells for cancer eradication. Globally, cancer continues to be a top 5 leading cause of death resulting in a high unmet need for novel therapies and treatments. Immune checkpoint inhibitor drugs have emerged as a potent solution with demonstrated clinical benefits. However, such treatments are expensive and toxic, and up to 70% of cancer patients do not respond to such drugs due to the absence of an anti-tumor response. In contrast, the proposed strategy tailors the patient's tumor to become susceptible towards their own pre-existing childhood vaccine immunity. This approach will change treatment outcomes for many cancer patients previously un-targetable by current immuno-therapeutic drugs. This also circumvents the risky and costly R&D challenges in identifying and/or producing potent immune responses against cancer.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a platform technology to mobilize immunity generated from childhood vaccines and re-direct this activity towards tumors to eradicate cancer. This will be done via two development aims.  The first aim will demonstrate the ability of the proposed technology to mobilize existing childhood vaccine responses from mice (with relevant human genetics) vaccinated with childhood vaccines (MMR, HepB, Chickpox vaccines). The second aim will be to test whether cancers with known metastasis challenges, such as ovarian and breast cancer, may be eradicated. Specifically, mice will be vaccinated with an appropriate childhood vaccine, then injected with relevant syngeneic tumors. Once the tumor is established, the proposed therapeutic will be injected to see if it can induce pre-existing immunity developed from the childhood vaccine and redirected towards the tumor. Therapeutic effect will be assessed based on the number of metastases and tumor weight/volume. If successful, this platform will provide both tumor specificity and broad applicability to a wide variety of cancers.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve the care of men with suspected prostate cancer, by providing the benefits of tumor localization within the prostate by state of the art endorectal multiparametric MRI combined with the benefits of precision biopsy using MRI-targeted needle sampling as a single patient-convenient procedure. The current standard approach to prostate cancer, transrectal ultrasound guided systematic biopsy, requires 12 needle samples from standard locations in the prostate with the hope of hitting any cancer that might be present. This option is essentially playing a game of battleships with the prostate, and is, unsurprisingly, inaccurate with high rates of underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis. Many patients require repeated biopsy because of these inaccuracies. By way of contrast, it is inconceivable that breast cancer would be diagnosed by placing twelve needles at standard locations in the breast, yet this has been the longstanding 'state-of-the-art' for prostate cancer. With approximately one million prostate biopsies are performed annually in the U.S., the market and clinical need is large and of major socioeconomic importance.

    The proposed project will preliminarily determine the technical and commercial feasibility of combining an endorectal MRI coil with a transrectal multichannel array of biopsy needle guides into a single device that would provide the ability to perform MRI for diagnosis and targeted needle placement as a single integrated procedure. Such a device could transform the current paradigm for prostate cancer diagnosis, providing greater precision, personalization, and patient convenience. To determine technical feasibility, the project plan is to fabricate and 3D print a proof-of-concept device for initial simulation experiments and selection of the final coil configuration, evaluate imaging performance of the device coil by measuring signal to noise ratio on standard MR images in a human male pelvic phantom and evaluate the fidelity of needle deployment by measurement of linear deviation between actual and intended needle positioning in a phantom in transverse and longitudinal directions. At all stages, continuous design and engineering modifications will be made to ensure satisfactory technical performance.

    and technological development represented by investment in high magnetic field
    laboratories were set out in influential reports of the National Academies of

    to achieve all-optical readout of the atomic spectra, from which information on
    the magnetic field is obtained.  During this project, theoretical atomic spectra
    in strong magnetic fields will be developed, tested and refined.  A vapor-cell
    probe suitable for sensing strong magnetic fields will be designed, fabricated,
    and tested.  Laboratory experiments will be performed to measure the atomic response
    to magnetic fields in the range of 1 Tesla at ppm sensitivity levels.  The method
    will also be tested in time-varying and switching magnetic fields, on timescales
    of <100ms. Miniaturization of probes and read-out units will be initiated, leading

    This STTR Phase I project will undertake the development of iron coordination complexes as alternatives for gadolinium contrast agents which are currently used in clinical MRI diagnostic exams.  New MRI contrast agents are needed to serve the segment of the population who cannot tolerate Gd(III) agents.  This includes patients with kidney disease and those who have frequent MRI scans and may accumulate Gd(III).  The proposed research involves the study of new trivalent iron coordination complexes based on those initially studied in the co-PI?s university laboratory. New iron complexes will be prepared and studied as contrast agents in live mice to improve characteristics of the agents such as clearance from the body.  Fundamental studies of the iron complexes will add to the body of knowledge on the paramagnetic properties of iron.
    For the most promising Fe(III) contrast agents, the synthetic procedures will be adapted for large scale preparation and purity determination.  Iron MRI contrast agents may also be beneficial to society by reducing gadolinium in water supply.  Furthermore, iron as an abundant element is less expensive and more readily available in the USA than is gadolinium. The commercialization of iron MRI contrast agents will create jobs in chemical manufacturing, sales, and in health-related occupations.

    The lead Fe(III) coordination complex on which this project is based produces longitudinal (T1) relaxivity of water protons that rival clinically used Gd(III) complexes at 4.7 Tesla, both under in vitro conditions and also in live mice. Importantly, these complexes contain macrocyclic ligands that stabilize iron in the trivalent state (negative redox potentials versus NHE) and do not produce reactive oxygen species even in the presence of ascorbate as a reductant and peroxide.  The importance of outersphere water and innersphere water interactions will be studied by varying the coordinating pendent groups on the macrocyclic ligand which is bound to Fe(III).   The ancillary group will be varied to increase binding to serum proteins and to modify the clearance route of the contrast agents either through kidneys or through hepatobiliary routes.  The complexes will be optimized for kinetic inertness towards release of iron under biologically relevant conditions.  Toxicity studies in cell culture will be carried out on each of the new complexes. This research will focus on both pilot scale preparation for the study of the Fe(III) complexes in vitro and also on larger scale preparations and HPLC analysis of the most promising new derivatives.  In vivo MRI scans in mice on a 4.7 T scanner will be used to track the distribution and clearance of the iron contrast agents as a function of time.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is a substantial reduction of leakage in high-density polyethylene (HDPE) pipes. HDPE is a type of plastic commonly used for water, oil, and gas distribution pipe systems. Billions of gallons of treated water are lost daily across the US due to leaking pipes, resulting in massive revenue loss, environmental and property damage, and energy waste. Furthermore, millions of metric tons of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, escape every year into the atmosphere through leaking pipes. Most leaks occur at pipe joints and by wirelessly monitoring each joint for leaks, as a part of a smart infrastructure network, major leak reduction can be achieved. The commercial impact of the project is extensive, as smart infrastructure networks are increasingly being implemented and expanded, sensor and wireless communication technology has advanced significantly in recent years, and the rate of piping infrastructure installations, replacements, and repairs are accelerating across the US and globally.

    The proposed project aims to demonstrate a prototype capable of detecting a leak in electrofusion joints and wirelessly communicate the leak to an external network. Such joint monitoring system is highly desirable as pipe leaks can go undetected for an extended period of time. Moreover, once detected, leaks can be difficult and expensive to locate, especially as pipes are commonly buried underground or situated at hard-to-reach or remote locations. The challenge that comes with this  is to provide a reliable local power source for the sensing unit that can be on standby for up to 50 years. A second challenge is to generate a signal, powered by the local power source, that can be transmitted to the surface and notify a leak to an external signal receiver. A water-activated battery combined with a radio-frequency identification (RFID) transmitter will be developed for this purpose. RFID technology is extensively used in a broad range of industries due to its low-cost and good reliability . This technology is, therefore, an excellent candidate for providing an affordable joint leak detection system.

    This SBIR Phase I project aims to further the development a novel nanoparticle-based synthetic platelet technology for the treatment of internal, non-compressible hemorrhage after traumatic injury. Trauma is the leading killer of people aged 1-46, and uncontrollable hemorrhage after injury is the cause of 35% of pre-hospital trauma deaths and 90% of military combat casualties. This is because there are currently no pre-hospital treatment options for internal, non-compressible hemorrhage. If the patient reaches a medical treatment facility in time, the current standard of care is transfusion with blood products, including platelets. However, natural platelet products suffer from shortage in supply (due to donor shortage), difficulty in portability, high risk of bacterial contamination, very short shelf life (3-5 days), requirement of blood typing and cross matching, and multiple biologic side effects (e.g. immune response). Therefore, there exists a significant clinical need for a synthetic platelet surrogate that can address the above limitations and can be administered at point-of-injury or during en route care to stop the bleeding earlier and potentially save lives. Beyond the potential clinical and commercial impact, the proposed research will also provide multi-disciplinary educational and research opportunities in major STEM areas at undergraduate level to create future scientists and engineers.

    A synthetic platelet technology has been developed that can simulate the hemostatic mechanisms and capabilities of natural platelets while allowing large-scale manufacturing, sterilization, long shelf-life and portability. The technology consists of a platelet-mimetic lipid-based nanoparticle, heteromultivalently surface-decorated with three types of small synthetic peptide ligands that render cooperative mechanisms of binding to von Willebrand Factor (vWF) and collagen (platelet-mimetic injury site-selective adhesion mechanisms) and binding to stimulated form of GPIIb-IIIa on active platelets (platelet-mimetic injury site-directed aggregation mechanism). This patented design is unique in that it is currently the only design that combines these adhesion and aggregation properties of natural platelets on a single synthetic platform. Preliminary studies have established the platelet-mimetic functional mechanisms in vitro as well as its significant hemostatic therapy capability in vivo in small (mouse) and large (pig) animal models of hemorrhage in both prophylactic and emergency administration frameworks. Building on these promising results, this project aims to conduct translationally-directed studies to address technical hurdles associated with manufacturing the synthetic platelets with batch-to-batch consistency and long shelf life (>1 year) at a range of storage conditions (widely varying temperatures, altitudes, etc), which would be highly relevant in austere civilian and military applications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project directly addresses the estimated $3.2 billion healthcare burden that develops from iatrogenic ureteral injuries that occur across the three million abdominal and pelvic surgeries being performed annually in the United States. Allotrope Medical creates innovative surgical solutions to improve patient outcomes and reduce procedure costs, directly addressing this situation.  Allotrope?s devices improve anatomical structure location and tissue identification thereby reducing the potential for injury while enhancing a surgeon?s confidence for reduced procedure time. Using smooth muscle stimulation, Allotrope?s StimSite is a sterile single-use, battery powered device that safely and reliably identifies the ureter location to avoid injury during these abdominal and pelvic surgical procedures. The ureter naturally contracts while draining urine from the kidneys into the bladder.  This smooth muscle structure is at risk of injury during dissection and pinching, the current standard surgical method, to mechanically elicit this contraction and thereby locating the ureter during surgery.  Allotrope has demonstrated StimSite?s ability to elicit the same contraction without surgical dissection, thereby diminishing the injury risk while also significantly reducing the surgical procedure time.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR Phase I project will advance the smooth muscle electrical stimulation technology used in StimSite. The project will improve product development and clinical understanding of the design's operating limits while increasing the product's clinical utility through better integration with the laparoscope's imaging system to display a stable indication of the ureter position.  This project encompasses three objectives:  First, using an instrumented breadboard device, the proprietary electrical pulse waveform will be studied characterizing how varying the waveform parameters affect tissue contraction responses.  Second, the performance of the preferred waveform will be evaluated in a porcine model to confirm in-vivo performance of a stand-alone configuration. Third, available image processing software will be evaluated to track and trace the ureter contraction and retain a road-map of the ureter position displayed on the monitor after the ureter has relaxed and is no longer directly visualized.  These three objectives will substantially advance Allotrope's smooth muscle electrical stimulation technology platform for the current device use and targeted future applications in esophageal, stomach and bowel tissue identification, etc.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the enabling the expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) through new functions and applications requiring greater wires-free power than available by battery. IoT is an ever-widening array of everyday objects interconnected via the Internet and transforming the way we live and work. "Smart devices" inter-networking in homes, businesses, vehicles, public spaces and elsewhere are an essential driver of the big data revolution, enabling innumerable societal benefits such as improved efficiencies, assure safety, and increase productivity. The growth of IoT devices has been enabled by the miniaturization, modularization, and cost reduction of common chipsets as well as increased intelligence in low-power consumption. IoT products that utilize existing wired power - e.g. smart lights, TVs, speakers, thermostats, security cameras, personal digital assistants, etc. - have dominated the market. Increasingly, however, stand-alone battery-powered IoT devices are gaining traction; but while battery technology is improving, the cost, complexity and downtime of battery replacement and/or recharging are major constraints. This project aims to develop a new type of indoor light harvesting technology capable of efficiently converting ambient indoor light into the electrical energy needed to power wire-free IoT products. 

    The proposed project aims to demonstrate and develop perovskite PV technology with the efficiency, uniformity, and durability needed for high-impact indoor IoT applications. Visible light is the most ubiquitous ambient power source available in places where humans live, work and gather, but existing light harvesting methods - e.g. crystalline and amorphous silicon PV cells - do not efficiently convert typical indoor light to electricity. For example, state-of-the-art amorphous silicon cells give only 3.6-7% efficiency under typical indoor lighting conditions. In order to enable new IoT products, a photovoltaic material that operates above 30% efficiency under a range of indoor lighting conditions is needed to unlock new levels of power available for sensors and communications that batteries may not easily supply. This project will demonstrate cell designs, film deposition and processing techniques needed to fabricate high-efficiency perovskite PV and to scale perovskite PV from university laboratory sizes to commercial IoT product sizes.

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase I project will develop a hand-held, point-of-care,
    sensing strip and instrument for immediate identification of which bacterial species
    are causing a urinary tract infection (UTI) in a companion animal. \nThis technology
    will allow veterinarians to judiciously prescribe antibiotics for an animal during
    the initial examination. In the United States alone, there are nearly 1.5 million
    veterinary visits annually for UTIs in dogs and cats. The average time to initial
    UTI test results is 48 hours, during which time the animal is generally consuming
    antibiotics. Less than half of urine cultures show any bacterial growth, indicating
    that the majority of antibiotic prescriptions were unnecessary. Further, it is
    important to identify which bacterial species are causing the UTI, so that the
    proper antibiotic can be administered. Prudent use of antibiotics will control
    the spread of infection and the emergence of antibiotic resistance, thus resulting
    in healthier animals and reducing the need for new antibiotic drug development.
    This project will help translate the initial research and discoveries that were
    funded previously by the National Science Foundation. The underlying principle
    for this technology is that each bacterial species produces and excretes its own
    unique set of chemicals that are used to coordinate intercellular activities,
    analogous to pheromones produced by animals. It is possible to identify what bacterial
    cells are present in a sample by detecting these chemicals. There are much greater
    quantities of the chemicals in the sample than bacterial cells, making this approach
    more sensitive and easier to implement than other technologies.\n\nThe proposed
    research will result in the creation of a label-free, aptamer-based, electrochemical
    sensing platform for the detection and identification of the four most common
    Gram-negative bacterial pathogens causing UTIs in companion animals, within two
    minutes of sample collection. The novelty of the approach is to measure unique
    quorum sensing molecules (QSMs) that are secreted by the bacteria. These QSMs
    are produced by all bacterial cells continuously at a rate of approximately 10,000
    molecules per hour, thereby improving the limit of detection by four orders of
    magnitude. An array of electrodes, modified with novel aptamers and functionalized
    with electro-active molecules, will be used to detect the QSMs, acting as biomarkers,
    produced by each bacterial species. Combining optimized aptamer molecules with
    electrochemical sensing and a proprietary signal processing algorithm allows for
    unprecedented limits of detection, sensitivity, and specificity. The technology
    will work directly in complex fluids without any reagent addition or separation
    steps."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to improve the way educators and therapists teach social skills to children who are on the autism spectrum (as well as those affected by other social skills disorders) and deliver cost efficiencies that could expand access to such support across diverse socioeconomic classes and geographical regions. These advances have potential to produce meaningful quality-of-life improvements for these children in areas such as employability, educational attainment, and personal relationships. Given that there are ~900K children on the spectrum in the US alone, and that the rate of diagnosis has been rising in recent years, the technology has significant potential for impact. It also has significant commercial potential: the US special education and therapy market is estimated at over 8 billion dollars, and feedback from therapists and educators has indicated significant commercial demand for a product like this. In addition, by pushing the frontiers of video game-based training by incorporating real-time eye tracking data, the proposed project will expand scientific and technological understanding of how video games can be used to shape human behavior.


    The proposed project involves furthering the development and evaluation of a video game designed to help children on the autism spectrum improve their social skills?a significant and growing need. Key development activities include (1) adding multiple types of gaze-controlled social skill training exercises, namely those targeting emotion recognition and joint attention; (2) incorporating a low-cost, consumer-grade eye tracker; (3) building an automated feedback system to ensure proper player positioning relative to the eye tracker; and (4) refining adaptive algorithms to personalize game difficulty and maximize engagement. These features will be designed and implemented by a diverse team with expertise in video game development, autism research, and technology commercialization. Evaluation will consist of tracking performance against quantitatively measurable success metrics related to game playability and engagement via human subject research across 10 participants (50 gameplay sessions). The expected result is a video game that addresses multiple social skill deficits, engages the target demographic, and can be deployed by therapists, educators, and parents in a cost-effective manner.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to achieve non-contact continuous blood pressure monitoring and address a critical need for personalized medicine for hypertension. For the first time, hypertensive individuals will have access to a comfortable, non-contact, continuous blood pressure monitoring device that allows for seamless blood pressure measurement without disturbing the user in any way. With 1 out of every 3 adults in the United States living with hypertension, The proposed innovation will meet an important need to monitor blood pressure continuously and noninvasively, thereby providing new insight into how one's blood pressure responds to medication, exercise, diet, and their actions. Longer term, the data collected by the team will yield unprecedented insight into short and long-term blood pressure rhythms and has the potential to revolutionize personalized medicine for hypertension. This technology is expected to empower people with the feedback that they need to understand what works for them as an individual to maintain their health.


    The proposed project will lay the ground work for the development of a continuous-wear blood pressure monitoring device suitable for everyday use. Through an RF sensor that can detect arterial movement, the proposed technology can measure cardiovascular parameters for every heartbeat. To date, a prototype sensor has shown significant promise at providing accurate blood pressure measurements in a small sample. Beyond blood pressure information, the fundamental capability of the proposed technology is to measure arterial stiffness, a critical indicator of cardiovascular health. With the support of this NSF grant, the team is expected to develop its technology and ready it for commercialization. The goal for this project is to: (1) eliminate first-surface reflections and micro-motion artifacts related to RF sensing; (2) refine blood pressure algorithms and compare measurements against gold standard BP measurements in healthy, hypotensive, and hypertensive populations. The proposed technology could become an important scientific tool to aid the advancement of cardiovascular research, enabling researchers and clinicians alike to gain further understanding of cardiovascular-related health parameter.

- abstractText: "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is aimed
    at developing a superior platform for the preparation of samples for cryogenic

    and structures of liquid-based samples with nanometer resolution, which provides
    crucial insight for the development of materials in the pharmaceutical, chemicals

    time required for blotting limits temporal resolution for studies of dynamic processes.
    A proprietary blotless sample thinning strategy reduces shear induced on the sample,
    and improves temporal resolution of sample preparation, by orders of magnitude.
    The integration of an innovative process with these advantages into a commercial

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is that it will serve as a one-stop power conversion solution across the power conversion industries. The proposed Power Converter can convert power directly from AC-DC, DC-DC, DC-AC and AC-AC in a single stage without an interim AC or DC link. The said power converter can take fixed frequency, variable frequency or DC voltage as input and can deliver another fixed frequency, variable frequency or DC voltage at the output. The voltage can be stepped up or down and the power can flow back and forth in the said power converter. Having all the power conversion features in one hardware can serve almost all power conversion applications such as aircraft/spacecraft/ship, hybrid/electrical vehicle, renewable energy, automation industry and almost all other power conversion needs by a mere change of software. Such technology has a potential to become a mass-produced commodity and in effect the cost of the power converter can be dramatically reduced across all industries, Market research organization has estimated that by 2020, the power converter market will be valued at $65 billion. Therefore, the commercial impact of this one stop power converter solution will be significant.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will introduce a multifunctional power converter with single stage power conversion. By employing bi-directional 4-quadrant wide band gap switch, intelligent filters at input and output, advanced pulse width modulation and commutation scheme a more efficient, robust, smaller foot print, low-weight power converter will be realized which will convert power from input to output much faster with reduced loss and at the same time it will not need any bulky DC or AC link in between. By operating less number of semiconductor switches at a given time the loss and size of the power converter will be reduced. By having intelligent filter, high power quality at the input and output will be achieved. The multifunctional use of this power converter will cut down the number of on board power converters in aircraft/spacecraft/ship in a system level which will provide multi-fold benefit in terms of fuel economy. By having less loss, the power consumption will be reduced and by having smaller size and weight the payload will be less, which will improve the fuel economy. By reducing number of on board power converters the on-board weight will be reduced further. Therefore, overall fuel economy will be significantly improved.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to drive the next generation of advanced computing power and performance, by manufacturing integrated circuits, the fundamental units of electronic systems, at length scales of 7 nm and smaller. Today?s central processing units (CPUs) each contain 7.2 Bn chips and over 1.2 sextillion chips are manufactured per year to meet computing demands. Next generation technology is expected to enable artificial intelligence and machine learning through both conventional computing and potentially neuromorphic paradigms, bringing to reality transformative applications such as self-driving cars and smart buildings. As Moore?s law continues to set the pace of technological advancement, chipmakers will deploy new EUV (Extreme Ultraviolet) lithography tools, using light of 13.5 nm to pattern integrated circuits or chip architecture into silicon wafers, for the next three generations of technology. Chipmakers strive to bring about the readiness of EUV technology in 2019. The global demand for next generation electronics is forever increasing as the population grows above 7 Bn. However, the global supply of electronics constantly faces challenges to reduce costs and deliver technology beyond Moore?s Law.

    The proposed project addresses the challenges related to high volume manufacturing at the 7 nm node for lithography tools and its components. For example, an EUV photomask, a high commodity component, patterns and replicates integrated circuit design into silicon wafers. Current EUV photomasks have a sub-optimal manufacturing yield of ~60% and suffer from defectivity which arises during fabrication of its architecture. During operational use the photomask sustains damage from the debris generated by the EUV plasma light source that implants in the mask and inevitably replicates in the wafer, destroying the integrated chip pattern. In high volume manufacturing, these issues manifest in the wafer yield, the reusability of a mask, and drive the need for high cost real-time inspection and metrology. A new EUV photomask which promises greater robustness to defects, a higher manufacturing yield, more reusability of masks in operations and a longer lifetime is presented. The goals of the project are to evaluate new integrated architecture for the EUV mask design, develop a higher yield fabrication process and characterize the EUV performance. More robust photomasks reduce the capital outlay required for in-situ metrology and inspection and ultimately bring down the cost of next generation electronics.

    This SBIR Phase I project seeks to transform treatment regimens for individuals suffering from malaria infections. Malaria, particularly caused by Plasmodium vivax (P. vivax) and Plasmodium ovale (P. ovale) remain a potential cause of morbidity and mortality amongst the 2.85 billion people living at risk of infection. The only drug currently available for treatment therapy for P. vivax and P. ovale is primaquine, which can cause life-threatening anemia in individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. Clinicians often do not prescribe primaquine due to the high prevalence (8%) of individuals who are born with G6PD deficiency. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Program for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH) are urgently searching for a reliable assay for the diagnosis of G6PD deficiency to effectively treat patients and aid in the eradication of P. vivax and P. ovale malaria. This novel assay proposed will quantify G6PD and hemoglobin (Hgb) concentration simultaneously from a finger stick sample. This system comprises a single test strip coupled with a reflectance-based meter and cell phone application with Blue Tooth connectivity to incorporate a patient?s I.D., test results, global tracking, and history of treatment. It is projected that this point-of-care assay will be used to screen >23 million people for G6PD within 5 years of launch and generate over $27.5 million in compounded revenue. In the long term, the novel assay will create a universal point-of-care platform that can be utilized for other diseases or conditions that affect patients in the Unites States for which point-of-care assays are not currently available.

    The proposed novel platform will quantify both Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) and hemoglobin (Hgb) concentrations simultaneously from a single finger stick sample using a point-of-care (POC) reflectance-based meter. There is currently no such device on the market, which is urgently needed to screen patients being treated for P. vivax and P. ovale malaria. A significant portion (8%) of the world population is G6PD deficient, which places these individuals at risk for life-threatening anemia after treatment with current therapeutics such as primaquine against malaria. The POC assay utilizes a novel lysis and reagent layer membrane platform to enable a reflectance-based meter to measure non-over lapping wavelengths to quantify G6PD and Hgb concentrations. In this proposal, a functional prototype reflectance-based meter and data collection software will be constructed and compared to readings obtained using the current ?gold standard? Konica Minolta spectrophotometer. Secondly, the POC assay will be validated through performance testing using a G6PD-deficient whole blood specimen bank provided by the Program for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH). Concordance of the data obtained from 20 samples for the proposed assay will be compared to the World Health Organization?s (WHO) approved spectrophotometric method for measuring G6PD and an FDA approved method for measuring Hgb. Success will be indicated by an R2 > 0.95, which demonstrates linear equivalency, as well as a demonstration that 90% of the data points fall within 2 sigma of each value. A POC assay that can simultaneously screen patients for both G6PD deficiency and Hgb levels will allow clinicians to treat patients with P. vivax and P. ovale malaria infections effectively and aid in the eradication of malaria.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to help identify people that have paroxysmal or asymptomatic cardiac arrhythmias before they become dangerous. Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia, and the prevalence of AF increases with age. AF has a profound impact on longevity and quality of life. Patients typically develop paroxysmal, short-lived episodes of the arrhythmia and are frequently asymptomatic. This often leads to delays in diagnosis of AF until later stages when the arrhythmia is more persistent. Even short episodes of paroxysmal AF are associated with increased risk for stroke, heart failure, hospitalization, and death. The population with undiagnosed AF is substantial and studies have shown that continuous ECG monitoring for more than 3 years is required to achieve close to 100% AF detection. Current 30-day monitors detect 5% of paroxysmal and asymptomatic cases, since events must occur while the monitor is being worn. An armband-based approach offers a way to overcome the current restrictions in chest based monitors and bridges the gap between short-duration 30-day monitors and long-term implanted monitors.


    The proposed project uses an armband-based device to capture electrocardiogram (ECG) and electromyogram (EMG) signals on the upper arm using a waterproof and wireless device. The sensors are made from a composite material that can operate both wet and dry and does not require adhesives or hydrogels to capture all aspects of the waveforms. The challenge with the upper arm is that the ECG signals have less magnitude then over-the-heart and it is necessary to remove motion / noise artifacts as well as EMG signals to create a clean ECG signal. The research is focused on embedding algorithms into the device and testing and refining them for removing motion and noise artifacts that are captured by an accelerometer and to remove EMG signals. After a clean signal is established, proven algorithms for classification of the arrhythmias can be run embedded in the device.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project achieves a widespread earthquake sensor network in the earthquake-prone regions. With this wide prevalence of the sensor network, this smart, real-time earthquake detection system can detect an earthquake within a second near an epicenter and notify the other users away from the epicenter before the shakings arrive, effectively creating an earthquake early warning system for society. This same infrastructure of the smart earthquake monitoring system can be transformed to detect other natural hazards such as landslides, volcano eruptions, mine explosions, generating larger social and economic benefits. With this technology, instead of some sparse seismic recordings that we have currently, we can collect dense earthquake data from tens of thousands of locations in cities, providing a block-by-block risk-assessment of earthquake hazards in cities. This dense data promises several orders of magnitude improvement in the current earthquake hazard maps and helps the first responders, catastrophic modelers, primary insurance and reinsurance companies, city planners, and building owners to better assess the earthquake hazard risks. The granular level of the risk maps has the potential to increase the awareness of earthquake hazard risk in society.

    The proposed project achieves a dense and hybrid seismic network using smartphones, tablets, and stationary IoT devices. A potential outcome of this project is a next-generation Earthquake Early Warning System with a sub-second response that repurposes smartphones, tablets, and other sensors of a large IoT ecosystem for the earthquake sensor network. To achieve the performance under a second, a new earthquake early warning system that scales the massive data streaming from multiple sources, enables sensor and server communication in the fraction of a second, finally builds a new push notification framework to alert hundreds of thousands in less than a second.

- abstractText: "Much as a river current carries a pebble, fluid flows can carry particulates
    such as nanoparticles and microcapsules. While mechanical pumps are conventionally
    used to drive fluid flow, chemical \"pumps\" can also propel fluid by using chemical
    reaction networks to create gradients in chemical concentrations and fluid densities.
    Researchers in the NSF Center for Chemo-Mechanical Assembly (CCMA) are creating
    new transformative tools to enable unprecedented control over fluid flow and particle
    organization in confined environments. These precisely controlled fluid flows
    enable the design of self-powered, self-sustaining systems that organize particles
    and are capable of performing complex functions such as an autonomous nanoparticle
    system that detects a chemical source and collectively delivers a response chemical
    to it resulting in a vital analysis or creation of a novel structure. The CCMA
    team includes expertise in catalysis, synthetic chemistry, physical chemistry,
    fluid flow, and modeling. In addition to providing the chemistry community with
    new chemical reaction network tools, CCMA is also contributing to science and
    technology workforce development by training students in multidisciplinary experimental
    and modeling techniques. Through its industry affiliates program, CCMA is engaging
    industry in student training and technology transfer. Concurrent with the research,
    the team is launching a vigorous program of education and outreach to the public.
    This includes expanding undergraduate and graduate research opportunities for
    underrepresented groups in research-based careers. The team is also participating
    in several large-scale public outreach programs including public lectures, designing
    hands-on traveling exhibits, and teaming with museums and science centers. \n\nThrough
    collaborative research that combines innovative modeling and experimental studies,
    the NSF CCI Phase I: Center for Chemo-Mechanical Assembly (CCMA) is harnessing
    catalytic chemical reactions to introduce spatiotemporal chemical gradients that
    drive the flow of a surrounding fluid. This flow, in turn, enables the manipulation
    of the collective behavior of suspended particles to drive new modes of dynamic
    self-organization. The Center is developing novel approaches to cause directed
    transport of nano- and micron-scale materials, control particle organization in
    confined chambers, and establish new chemical routes for regulating non-equilibrium
    structure formation from particles in solution. These studies are providing the
    chemistry community with fundamentally new tools and knowledge, including new
    chemistries for the creation of catalytic cascades; determination of design rules
    for chemical feedback loops; demonstration of new modes of out-of-equilibrium
    assembly; and progress toward new understanding of the nonlinear behavior and
    auto-amplification emerging from these systems. Potential applications include
    the creation of standalone microfluidic devices that autonomously perform multi-stage
    chemical reactions and assays for portable biomedical applications; automated
    materials assembly in harsh environments; and small-scale factories that can operate
    autonomously to build microscale components for use in fine instrumentation and
    robotic systems, and, in parallel, to screen for optimal reaction parameters yielding
    micro-machines with specified properties. To generate excitement and public appreciation
    about this emerging area of chemistry, the CCMA team is participating in several
    large-scale public outreach programs at the participating institutions, including
    public lectures, hands-on traveling exhibits, and museum and science center projects."

    Transfer (STTR) Phase I project lies in treating clinical and subclinical inattention
    within a few minutes, by simply listening to algorithmically-generated music.
    Failures of attention have dramatic clinical and non-clinical ramifications. In
    the non-clinical side, nearly 90% of people attest to wasting time in the workplace,
    and this reduced efficiency has an estimated $1 T economic impact in the US alone.
    At the clinical level, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), the best-characterized
    attentional deficit, affects over 8M children in the US, with the leading solution
    being a near-epidemic growth of prescriptions stimulants. However, over 4 M American
    adults do not meet all the criteria to be diagnosed with ADHD (and therefore cannot
    be prescribed medication), and have no convenient alternatives for treatment.
    Brain.fm is a non-invasive auditory stimulation platform designed to treat inattention.
    It generates music designed specifically to stimulate attentional networks in
    our brain by exploiting the latest neuroscience concepts of how neurons entrain
    to stimulus rhythms. Our objective is for Brain.fm to become a validated, non-invasive
    therapeutic tool for Attention to help everyone who suffers from mind wandering,
    regardless of whether they meet diagnostic criteria for ADHD. \n\nThe proposed
    project is aimed at experimentally demonstrating generalizable changes in attention
    through auditory stimulation. For decades, neuroscientists have observed wave-like
    activity in the brain and related them to attentional states. The ability to change
    attentional states, via noninvasive brain stimulation, would be greatly desirable
    for everyday functioning as well as crucial for understanding how brain waves
    relate to behavior. The proposed project tests a novel auditory neuroscience-informed
    platform solution for delivering noninvasive brain stimulation through music.
    In addition to establishing a revolutionary method to enhance attention noninvasively
    by tuning brain waves through comprehensive behavioral and fMRI studies, we test
    the efficacy of this method to treat inattention, especially in adults with Attention
    Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Key outcomes of this project are: 1) non
    clinical (but Institutional Review Board-approved) studies that determine how
    this auditory therapy impacts attention on an adult ADHD prone population, 2)
    a deeper understanding of the neurophysiological mechanisms of attention and neuronal
    entrainment, and 3)optimization of our product by testing different versions of
    our algorithmically generated music on our existing customer base. Results are
    expected to show how purpose-built acoustic stimulation can support the neuronal
    oscillations underlying sustained attention, thus boosting productivity and well-being."

    with the grand challenge of developing teaching methods that optimize learning
    given the diversity of individual preferences and the complexity of each human
    brain. Because there is a great variability in stroke-induced lesions that result
    in marked differences in impairment and responsiveness to motor therapy, there
    is even a greater need to personalize motor training in post-stroke patients.
    The commercial impact of the personalized e-rehabilitation system, which will
    be developed and tested, derives from its value for patients, clinics, and insurers.
    For patients, the system will provide personalized training, and, because it will
    encapsulate research-based principles for effective and efficient neurorehabilitation
    of the upper extremity, it will largely improve patients' outcomes. For clinics,
    the system will increase revenues by increasing the number of visits per patient
    due to better outcomes and compliance, as well as the number of patients trained
    at once in clinic gyms. For insurers, the system will generate reports showing
    therapy effectiveness and, thus, validate reimbursements. \n\nThis Small Business
    Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is improving functions of the upper
    extremities following neurological disorders that affect the motor system, in
    particular stroke, but also Parkinson's disease and traumatic brain injury. Because
    therapists treating patients with these disorders only have the time to deliver
    about a 1/10th of the necessary dose of motor training in the clinic, patients
    are requested to perform most of the training at home. A novel augmented reality
    training system will be developed and tested. The system will automatically deliver
    high doses of functional tasks via presentations of virtual targets or objects
    in the real world. Using state-of-the-art motion sensing technology, the system
    will accurately and precisely measure upper body movements, including hand opening
    and closing. Based on these measurements, it will maximize recovery by providing
    adaptive training. It will maximize patient engagement and motivation by providing
    real-time and summary feedback for task success and improvements."

    quickly.  One major potential societal benefit will be directly related to visually

    algebra and calculus, and other visual disciplines.  Tactile Analogics? devices
    are intended to help them to understand such concepts by representing shapes/

    Furthermore, the commercial success will be in producing and selling such devices

    and print.  Tactile Analogics? devices will offer a rapid fast-refreshing speed
    of up to 30 times per second, allowing the creation of frames according to the
    image that they are representing.  This solution will enable blind to not depend
    on pinned paper to understand images or shapes. In general, this is a haptic way
    to retrieve information and technically not limited to blind people.  The opportunity

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes the development and demonstration of a prototype position sensor that will help convert hydraulic and pneumatic actuators into ?smart? devices.  The position sensor will enable built-in self-diagnostics, precise feedback control, energy efficient operation, faster industrial manufacturing and material handling processes, and safer operations on mobile vehicles that take locations of obstacles and danger zones automatically into account during motion. The value proposition of the new sensor comes from its lower cost, ease of installation, and its non-contacting operation.  This project will help a start-up company demonstrate the performance of its sensor on multiple actuator products provided by large industrial and off-road mobile companies.  This is expected to result in establishing the viability of the sensor, customer orders for the sensor, and growth in company revenues. The technology area addressed by the research in this project is smart sensors and the targeted market sector is industrial machines and off-road agriculture and construction vehicles.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a prototype position sensor that is production-ready and ready for field testing in real-world industrial and mobile vehicle applications.  The sensor utilizes a large-distance magnetic field model, redundant magnetic sensors on a single sensor board and adaptive estimation algorithms to provide a novel position sensor that is small, non-intrusive, non-contacting, easy to install and lower cost compared to other position sensors on the market.  The innovations in the sensor technology being developed include the use of a nonlinear estimation algorithm that avoids differentiation of complex nonlinear functions, provides more accuracy and is computationally efficient for implementation on a microprocessor.  The sensor also includes an auto-calibration algorithm that corrects for sensor location and orientation errors so as to ensure accurate performance with changing cylinders.  The research project will demonstrate the performance of the sensor prototype in the lab on multiple actuators provided by collaborating large industrial and off-road vehicle companies.

    This SBIR Phase I project will develop the necessary technology and manufacturing workflows to provide medical professionals with extremely realistic physical models of tissues and organs. The models will be manufactured rapidly (within a few hours), inexpensively, and on-demand. They will be patient-specific based on the patient?s CT and MRI scan data.  This will have profound implications on the planning of complex medical procedures such as tumor removal and will enable medical professionals and their teams to practice patient-specific surgical scenarios. This will improve surgical outcome, generate efficiencies in the operating room and decrease medical errors which, by some accounts, are the third largest cause of death in the United States. The ability to 3D print realistic human organ models will also provide medical students with a way to practice medical procedures with a wide degree of diversity. This will accelerate the learning rate and expand the breadth of training experiences.  Similarly, the models will provide a way for medical professionals to practice rare, high-risk procedures on-demand. The proposed 3D models will become a central part of the medical simulation toolbox and will enable a new generation of surgical planning and education.

    The ability to manufacture extremely realistic physical models rapidly, inexpensively, and on-demand relies on a novel multimaterial additive manufacturing process with a closed-feedback loop enabled by machine vision. This new process manufactures objects layer by layer, each layer made from a discrete set of elements, where each element is built from one material from a pallette of materials. The use of the closed-feedback loop system allows incorporating both liquids and solids with a wide range of mechanical and appearance properties. The development of a material palette that is necessary to mimic properties of real tissues will be a crucial part of the project. This material palette will be expanded by spatially combining base materials into composite structures. The second main thrust of the project relies on a software design workflow that translates geometric and material specifications describing a simulation model (e.g., an organ or a tissue) into multimaterial volumetric data. The volumetric data will be used as input to the multimaterial printing platform. The new design workflow requires development of modeling approaches that go beyond traditional, boundary-based CAD representations.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be to innovate a novel patient tracking system, which will improve robotic surgery usability in an intra-operative environment. Robotic surgery is becoming ubiquitous across various medical procedures, and data continues to show improved clinical results. However, usability challenges impede broader adoption. This project will combine multiple tracking modalities, including mechanical and optical tracking, to create a hybrid tracking technology that allows for the advantages of each modality. This will optimize patient range of motion while minimizing line-of-sight challenges. This patient tracking technology can be used in conjunction with an existing robotic surgery system for dental implant procedures, which comprise a significant market opportunity. Dental implants are the standard of care for tooth replacement, and the dental implant market in the US is over $1 billion and growing nearly 8% per year with more than 14 million implants being placed annually worldwide. This technique can be used not only to revolutionize dental implant surgery, where the system is currently applied, but also to potentially create opportunities in other cranial procedures, which are otherwise burdened by invasive, cumbersome tracking technologies that impede intra-operative usability.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate the feasibility of the first hybrid patient tracking device that combines mechanical and optical tracking methods. Optical tracking systems require that cameras have direct line-of-sight to several tracked markers in the surgical field, which poses a significant challenge to the surgeon and assistants that have to carefully avoid blocking the camera's field-of-view. Mechanical tracking systems limit a patient's range of motion and can be bulky. The success of this project will lead to the development of a robotic surgery system for dental implant procedures that encompasses: 1) pre-operative CT-based planning software, 2) a visual guidance system that provides on-screen graphics like a GPS system, 3) a hybrid optical and mechanical tracking system that monitors the patient position, and 4) a robot arm that physically grasps the drill at the same time as the surgeon in order to provide haptic feedback, constraining the surgeon to match the planned osteotomy. This system enables minimally invasive, flapless surgery that is shown to result in less pain for the patient and faster surgery. It is designed to be easy to use and seamlessly integrate into the surgeon's workflow.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the practical deployment of a computer-vision based yield estimation system in fruit orchards.  This will provide fruit farmers with a useful tool in planning their harvest and sales, as well as in managing the long-term health of their plants.  This will potentially reduce the inherent risk in fruit growing, thereby improving the affordability and availability of fresh fruit in the US.  Better certainty may particularly help small growers, because they have less existing capability to manage risk.  Furthermore, by allowing adoption of precision agriculture techniques techniques to high value crops, this project may help save water and contribute to reduction of runoff pollution from fertilizer and chemicals.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the problem of vision-based fruit detection and mapping of fruit, for purposes of yield mapping.  The research objectives are to improve the commercial usability and robustness of existing yield-mapping approaches, so that they can be applied in production fruit orchards.  The anticipated technical results of this project include demonstration of useful yield mapping of apples, in a variety of real world production orchard environments, in a variety of weather and lighting conditions.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be achieved through shifting the paradigm of waterway maintenance into a more regular occurrence, giving way to reduced pollutant levels in waterways, since they will be promptly removed instead of allowing them to accumulate toxins, and increase property values, utilization, and income within the marina industry. Additionally, embedded sensor intelligence and continuous waterway monitoring will grant the community and dredging regulatory agencies increased visibility and understanding of the health of the marine life in the waterway and allow them to more closely monitor environmental violations. With widespread adoption and further development, the innovation could potentially have far-reaching benefits in assisting with water and energy security by keeping inlet canals and reservoirs that comprise our society?s infrastructure clean and running at peak efficiency.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will aim to design, develop, and test an intelligent suction tip for use in year-round sediment removal in waterways. Current sediment removal technologies are destructive to marine ecosystems and costly to employ. As such, this project aims to develop an intelligent suction tip for marine life avoidance during robotic sediment removal in waterways. The project activities include the design and rapid prototyping of a suction tip filter that prevents fish entrainment, design and implementation of water quality sensors for environmental niche modeling, in-house saltwater testing, and marine representative freshwater testing.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is establishment of sustainable, cost-effective technology to mitigate local volatile organic chemicals (VOCs) and other indoor air pollutants by using photocatalysts to effectively destroy them at their point of generation. VOC exposure is pervasive in many commercial environments, including nail salons, where employees work with materials that emit VOCs which can pose health risk without adequate protection. The proposed innovation addresses key gaps limiting the successful application of photocatalysts to these environments, specifically the need to eliminate by-products that may form during VOC destruction and the use of visible light-emitting diodes (LEDs) as alternatives to the harmful ultraviolet (UV) lights currently employed for photocatalysis. Novel photocatalytic materials will be applied to achieve safe, facile implementation at the point of exposure in commercial activities where employees are directly impacted. An improved understanding of the activity of innovative photocatalysts in the visible light range will enhance the overall understanding of photocatalytic materials. The technology will also form the core foundation of high performance and attractive residential products, which will improve indoor air quality in homes. Together, these applications hold the promise to broadly impact society by providing improved health for millions of people.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to improve indoor air quality by developing a technology platform to enable efficient and effective point-of-use VOC removal in commercial, residential, and select industrial environments. Photocatalysts are widely known as effective chemical scrubbers and disinfectants. When exposed to UV light, the surfaces become chemically active via formation of reactive oxygen species. This surface chemistry has been proven effective to decompose toxic VOCs and to kill spores, bacteria, and viruses. Because it is harmful to humans, the use of UV light to activate the photocatalyst greatly limits implementation of this technology. Additionally, ineffective photocatalyst designs can result in incomplete decomposition of the VOCs. The goal of the current research is to develop a visible-LED-activated photocatalyst engineered to completely convert target VOCs to carbon dioxide and water. The improvements to the photocatalyst design will enable its implementation in luminaires that are easily integrated into the work environment at the point of VOC generation. The decomposition of VOCs at concentrations typically found in commercial and home environments will be explored using the developed photocatalyst, with particular attention given to the mitigation of by-products and the enhancement of photocatalyst lifetime.

    alternative to Diesel engines for use in heavy-duty applications such as on-road
    transportation, off-road farm equipment, and stationary power generation. Currently,
    Diesel engines are used in all of these applications because they are robust and
    powerful. Unfortunately, they also produce significant smog, soot, and greenhouse
    gases that are damaging to individuals and the environment. In contrast, the engines
    developed under this project will have cleaner exhaust while producing more power
    at increased efficiency, all while utilizing inexpensive alternative fuels. Since
    Diesel-fueled engines move 70% of the world's goods, and produce 30% of distributed
    power around the globe, these engines are inextricably linked to quality of life,
    and transformational improvements in their operation can have a large, broad,
    positive impact on society. This project's new engines will continue to provide
    essential services, but in a way that reduces operating costs (creating savings
    that can be passed on to consumers) and emissions (further saving consumers money,
    and improving air quality in heavily-trafficked regions). These engines will fulfill
    a critical market need for clean, powerful engine solutions, and can be integrated
    into existing American-made engine product lines, increasing manufacturing revenue,
    stimulating job creation, and ensuring that the United States will remain a global
    leader heavy-duty engine production.\n\n \nThis project will focus on enabling
    these clean, powerful engines by developing a novel, high-temperature combustion
    system that allows traditional engines to be adapted to burn alternative fuels
    in an efficient and soot-free manner. This requires integration of a unique combination
    of technologies, joined in a way that provides benefits far greater than those
    that can be achieved with the individual components in isolation. Removing any
    piece from this specific combination drastically reduces performance. Because
    each component plays a critical role, this project has high risk (as each subsystem
    must function properly), but its sophistication also presents a high barrier to
    similar efforts (since incorrect use of any component yields significantly worse
    results). This project will build on previous proof-of-concept data that verified
    the feasibility of this concept, and will focus on the development of key engine
    subsystems, seeking to mitigate risk enough that investment from the private sector
    is possible. At the end of the project, the subsystems will be integrated into
    a stationary power generator as a retrofit to an existing Diesel engine, adapting
    it for alternative fuel use. This would serve as a prototype platform for the
    technology?illustrating its increased efficiency and power, along with reduced
    emissions?and demonstrating the value of the technology to market incumbents,
    hopefully spurring a licensing arrangement for engine production."

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of a much-needed novel prosthetic
    valve that will provide a potential treatment option for the millions of U.S.
    patients suffering from chronic venous insufficiency (CVI). As people age, valves
    in the veins of their legs begin to function poorly. This allows blood to build

- abstractText: "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project seeks development
    of a novel dosimeter for 2-D mapping of radiation dose in real-time at sub-millimeter
    spatial resolution. The high spatial resolution of the dosimeter is essential
    in supporting stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and stereotactic body radiation
    therapy (SBRT) treatments. These rapidly emerging modalities deliver precise doses
    of radiation to small, well defined treatment sites while minimizing exposure
    of critical neighboring anatomy. With the annual number of SRS/SBRT treatments
    approaching 1,000,000 and growing 5-10% annually there is a market need for a
    dosimeter with sub-millimeter resolution and the capability of measuring in real-time.
    The routine pre-treatment verification of each patient therapy plan becomes a
    target application. The value of the market for the dosimeter alone exceeds $10
    million annually. The value is amplified through enablement of the safe and efficacious
    delivery of SRS and SBRT treatments.  Use of these modalities greatly impacts
    the efficiency of radiotherapy by substantially reducing the number of individual
    sessions in a course of treatment. The net result is lower cost for the treatment
    course, an increase in the number of patients/year for each linear accelerator
    equipment unit and a large reported improvement in patient outcomes.      \n\nThe
    intellectual merit of this project lies in combining and adapting key elements
    of two well-established commercial technologies, piezoelectric polymers and radiochromic
    film, to produce a hybrid dosimeter. This dosimeter preserves the high spatial
    resolution of radiochromic film while improving its usability by making the changes
    caused by radiation exposure to become detectable by electronic means in real-time.
    During use, the flexible, single-use piezoelectric array dosimeter (PARD) fits
    into a re-usable data acquisition electronics module that transmits a map of measured
    doses to a Medical Physicist outside the radiation cell. Radiochromic film, the
    only current dosimeter with sub-millimeter spatial resolution, is inconvenient
    owing to the long delay between exposure and measurement as well as the extra
    time and effort in facilitating the measurements. This drawback adversely impacts
    its usefulness in the day-to-day verification of patient treatment plans. The
    hybrid PARD product provides a dense, flexible array (0.1 mm spacing) of detectors
    with the unique ability for dose measurement at sub-millimeter resolution in real
    time. This overcomes key drawbacks of existing electronic array devices which
    are incapable of spatial resolution below 5 mm and unsuitable for the small radiation
    fields associated with SRs and SBRT treatments."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the development and validation of technologies that enable electric energy systems to operate reliably and affordably with very large amounts of renewable energy. Clean, reliable and affordable electricity is vital to modern society.  However the variability of wind and solar generation can lead to catastrophic grid reliability problems if real-time demand does not match the supply.  This project will develop and demonstrate a system to manage distributed (e.g., rooftop) solar photovoltaic systems operating with and without local electrical energy storage (i.e., batteries) in a way that extracts the most value for the customer, while simultaneously improving the reliability of the electricity infrastructure.  The project will leverage algorithms inspired by those used by millions of devices to send data over the Internet.  Like Internet data, energy will be delivered in discrete energy packets. These packets are coordinated independently, anonymously, and fairly to simultaneously solve real-world grid problems and provide value to end-users. The result of this project will be an integrated software-as-a-service and hardware solution in which customers gain incentives for participating and electricity industry members realize savings by reducing infrastructure needs, such as additional fossil fuel generation.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will enable the decentralized, randomized, and bottom-up coordination of two- and four-quadrant power-electronic inverters attached to solar photovoltaic and electric battery storage systems. In contrast to competing, centralized, top-down scheduling approaches, the proposed technology enables inverters to regulate both active and reactive power output according to an automaton that undergoes probabilistic state-transitions based on both real-time local measurements and communication with an aggregator. By incorporating local measurements, the method ensures that the energy needs of the end-use consumer are met while providing flexibility to a load aggregator or electric utility. This flexibility will enable distribution utilities to manage feeder power flows, losses, and voltage constraints. The probabilistic nature of the coordination prevents harmful synchronization effects, such as oscillations, while maintaining privacy of end-consumers through anonymous interactions akin to how data packets are routed on the Internet. Upon completion of the project, a commercially viable, human-friendly software-as-a-service (SaaS) technology will be demonstrated that implements this decentralized approach to coordinate distributed inverters in a manner that is compatible with modern grid operations.

    fast, smart, and more powerful in terms of imaging and probing local mechanics.
    \ The company has a track record of commercializing AFM controllers that are compatible
    with most all types of scanners, commercial and home-constructed.  Current AFM

    In addition, new AFM users are also anticipated especially in the areas of nanomaterials,

    resolution in conjunction with fast speed shall result in immediate advances in
    the fields of material development, surface coating, nanomaterial and nanodevice
    inspection and quality control, nanolithography, and tissue engineering.  Based

    be achieved by implementing a novel reconfigurable processor optimized for AFM
    into a unique hybrid, low-noise controller architecture, which is highly versatile

    different vendors.  In addition, the automatic feature finding and tracking functions
    will be accomplished using artificial intelligence directly in hardware and a
    novel scan pattern, completely different from current ?trace-retrace? scanning
    trajectory in current AFM.  These new and ?smart? approaches further speed up
    scanning and tracking speed.  Finally, the AFM will be able to produce nanomechanical
    images with high speed and accuracy using multifrequency spectroscopy. This concept
    has been proposed, and individual aspects have been demonstrated in isolation

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will be to significantly increase recovery efficiency and decrease ecological footprint. The ecological footprint is decreased by reducing the amount of water required to produce oil and gas from many low permeability U.S. unconventional plays. Further, it will provide access to the vast reserves of potential oil and gas (estimated at greater than 2 trillion barrels) stored as immature organic material helping to enhance energy independence for the US. The new methods will enhance production of oil and gas from a controllable volume surrounding development wells.  The proposed methods will replace the rapid declines in well productivity of fracked wells, and the accompanying typically less than 10% recovery of hydrocarbons in place, by a strategy which will construct multi-year oil and gas "factories" which will have continuous, predictable, twenty year production lifetimes. Increased recovery factors through increased efficiency will enhance the value of existing plays and provide a step-change in sustainable energy production while lowering environmental impact through reducing surface disruption and minimizing water use and disposal.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop the models necessary to simulate
    the Radio Frequency (RF) waterless stimulation process, and to provide laboratory and numerical data to support that model. A self-consistent model of the RF system and its downhole environment, is required to define the conditions for which RF stimulation makes economic sense, and to optimize system design for a given target play. Project objectives are to 1) demonstrate design of a RF system which mitigates the previous problems found with RF heating, 2) test in the laboratory the effects of RF heating on reservoir rock subject to realistic in situ conditions to understand the resultant crack field and accompanying permeability enhancement, including the impact of RF heating on immature kerogen, 3) model the resulting stress and fracture fields with sufficient fidelity to make predictions for oil and gas recovery, and 4) use this information to form a self consistent model of the process so that various shale plays can be evaluated. A commercial multiphysics numerical modeling approach will be used to simulate the physical processes that occur including feedback to account for temperature increases and the impacts of in situ stress and structural complexity.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project relates to the management of clotting
    and bleeding which is a major clinical challenge that costs > $100B healthcare system burden. In
    the United States, it affects more than ten million patients of major surgery, trauma,
    cardiovascular disease, stroke and cancers. The underlying biology is a complex orchestration of
    protein and cellular pathways that react in the context of blood flow. Proven diagnostic tools that
    capture this complexity, and also meet the constraints of diverse challenges do not exist. This
    project intends to create a novel modular hemostasis test platform using proprietary microsystem
    modules deployed in configurable cartridges tailored to meet clinical requirements. Initially a
    3D microelectrode based platelet function test module will be developed and optimized with
    potential for best in class performance following multi-scale optimization of the dynamic,
    physical diagnostic environment.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop a simple, low
    cost platelet function assay (PFA) with the objective of delivering best in class performance via
    multiscale optimization of the local biophysical diagnostic environment. Multiplate Electrode
    Aggregometry (MEA), a macroscale impedance-based device has already shown promise, yet
    remains cumbersome and has suboptimal classification accuracy between patient subsets. In
    MEA tests, as with most PFAs, the role of local fluid shear and macro/microscale physical
    environment remains largely neglected despite their well-recognized role in platelet response.
    Preliminary work suggests untapped potential in controlling and modifying PFA performance.
    By optimizing these signals with respect to clinical end points and subpopulation differentiation,
    this shear-based micro-platelet function test modules stand to revolutionize platelet function
    testing for the broadest possible benefits.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to create a personalized, precision-based practice paradigm for surgery that improves surgical outcomes and reduces the cost of healthcare. This paradigm utilizes individual patient characteristics with machine-learning algorithms to accurately predict the risk of post-surgical complications. Additionally, it offers the possibility of enacting impactful interventions among high-risk patients, while reducing unnecessary therapies among low-risk patients, thereby improving surgical outcomes, maximizing the efficiency of healthcare, and minimizing cost. In a value-based care model, this paradigm aligns the goals of health systems, surgeons, and patients.

    The proposed project combines individual patient data with machine-learning algorithms to effectively predict surgical complication risk and improve surgical clinical outcomes. Currently, 13% of 50 million surgical procedures performed in the United States annually result in a surgical complication, half which are potentially avoidable. A primary cause of avoidable complications include significant variable in risk assessment and standardized preventative practice. Therefore, the principal objective of this proposal is to develop machine-learning predictive models of various surgical complications (wound, cardiac, respiratory, renal, etc.), which provides an objective risk assessment for surgeons. Additionally, this risk assessment platform will allow stratification of patients into high- vs. low-risk categories and link patients with risk-appropriate preventative interventions at the point-of-care.

- abstractText: "This NSF SBIR Phase I project takes a unique holistic approach to
    both tumor imaging and cancer drug delivery.  This approach harnesses cancer cell
    proteins already in the body to allow selective delivery of tumor imaging agents
    or cancer-killing drugs to, and into, cancer cells.  By choosing cancer-specific
    targeting proteins, the drugs will be transported primarily into cancer cells
    and undesirable off-target enrichment will be diminished.  The goal is to mitigate
    drug uptake in non-cancerous fast-growing cells like; heart cells, bone marrow,
    skin or hair follicles.  Treated patients will benefit from improved effectiveness
    of their cancer therapies.  Such selective delivery should permit lower dosages
    of drug to be administered while also lowering the risks of unwanted, problematic
    side-effects. This cost-effective approach is well supported by the NSF?s core
    mission for the technical development of innovative drug delivery systems. \n\nIt
    remains challenging to provide sensitive tumor diagnosis and near-simultaneous
    assessments of response to cancer treatments in treated individuals.  Of all the
    standard monitoring modalities, radiographic examination has been the most widely
    used to measure treatment response.  However, some studies suggest up to 10-40%
    of cancers may not be measurable by currently available technologies.  Various
    delivery approaches have been used to take advantage of endogenous molecules to
    transport imaging agents or drugs with increased specificity into cancer cells.
    \ Most of these approaches utilize macromolecular ligands or cell surface receptor
    binding approaches.  This proposal takes a mechanistically innovative small-molecule
    approach.  By harnessing the activities of endogenous inflammatory proteins produced
    in abundance by cancer cells and by cells within the tumor micro-environment,
    small molecule cancer drugs can be transported with efficiency to the site of
    their intended effect.  Selective and accurate placement of a chemically-related
    diagnostic agent into cancer cells should allow a cost-effective, more personalized
    and exceedingly sensitive view of treatment response."

    Transfer (STTR) project will be the development of a novel method for synthetic
    oligodeoxynucleotide purification. Currently, most oligodeoxynucleotides are purified
    using chromatography. The techniques are expensive or difficult to scale up, and
    unsuitable for parallel purification of multiple different samples. The proposed
    technology is easy to scale up for large-scale purification and suitable for parallel
    purification. Several areas that require synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides will
    benefit from the technology including oligodeoxynucleotide therapeutics and oligodeoxynucleotides
    used in genome assembly for synthetic biology applications. For therapeutic manufacturing,
    the proposed technology is expected to bring down the cost of production. For
    synthetic biology, the bottleneck is in the area is de novo construction of genomes,
    which requires large numbers of synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides. Parallel purification
    using the proposed technology will make these materials more affordable. In addition,
    the proposed technology can be readily extended to purify other biooligomers including
    peptides and oligosaccharides. This extension will have a high impact in areas
    such as biomedical research. \n\nThis STTR Phase I project proposes to method
    for synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide purification based on the \"catching by polymerization\"
    concept for the purification of synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides. Currently, most
    synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides are purified using chromatography methods, which
    rely on the rate of speed difference at which product and impurities travel in
    a solid matrix when eluted with solvents for separation. Drawbacks include expensive
    instrumentation, intensive labor, use of large volumes of harmful solvents and
    inability to purify long sequences. This method is expensive to scale up and unsuitable
    for parallel purification. This project aims to commercialize the catching full-length
    sequence by polymerization oligodeoxynucleotide purification technology to solve
    these problems. The method works by selectively tagging a polymerizable group
    to the oligodeoxynucleotide product, polymerizing it into an insoluble polymer,
    washing away all impurities and then cleaving the product from the polymer. Because
    the principle on which the product is separated from impurities is drastically
    different from that of chromatography methods, the proposed technique has many
    advantages, which include no need for expensive instrumentation, simple-to-use,
    low waste to product ratio, and suitability for purification of long sequences.
    Additionally, the new technique is readily scalable for large-scale purification,
    and can be easily adopted for parallel purification."

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology
    Transfer (STTR) project is to develop an engineered nonmodel yeast platform for
    the economical and sustainable production of natural aroma compounds. High quality
    aroma compounds have a variety of applications, ranging from flavor and fragrance
    to cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. With the strong consumer demand for more natural
    alternatives to chemically synthesized ingredients in both food and personal care
    items, the production of these ingredients by fermentation will add a renewable
    source to the supply chain and will reduce demand on botanical sources. This work
    will advance methodologies and knowledge for creating novel microbial cell factories
    via 13C-metabolite tracing, metabolic flux analysis, fermentation optimization,
    and kinetic modeling. The lessons from this research will offer general guidelines
    for overcoming biosynthesis hurdles and optimizing bioprocess operations, and
    will facilitate the development of transferable technologies for inexpensive production
    of diverse natural products that are broadly used for human health and wellness.
    \ \n \nThis STTR Phase I project proposes to integrate synthetic biology and bioprocess
    engineering to optimize the microbial strain for the de novo production of natural
    aroma compounds. Because plants carry aroma compounds in extremely low amounts,
    commercial extracts from plants are not economically viable. To overcome these
    challenges, this project will develop a novel fermentation process for production
    of these compounds with high product specificity and yields. Specifically, a nonmodel
    yeast strain will be engineered via PUSH (increase the supply of the precursor
    acetyl-CoA), PULL (overexpress key biosynthetic pathway genes), POWER (enhance
    ATP and NADPH generation) strategies. Further, 13C-metabolic flux analysis will
    be used to rigorously measure in vivo enzyme functions, to delineate acetyl-CoA
    supply/consumption pathways, and to identify metabolic burdens or bottleneck factors.
    Meanwhile, novel simultaneous fermentation and product recovery will be built
    to improve productivity. The fluxome information and fermentation kinetics will
    offer guidelines for rational genetic modifications and bioprocess optimizations.
    Ultimately, this environmentally friendly process would provide a new, reliable

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to provide a new class of biorational chemicals (based on chemical communicants from plant symbiotic fungi) that provide season-long improvements in plant productivity including enhanced root growth, resistance to a variety of stresses including drought, and increases in plant yield. This system will be developed for delivery as a seed treatment or as an augmented fertilizer. The novel products will be sold to famers through already-developed delivery systems primarily through agricultural distributors and seed companies. They are expected to increase plant root development, crop yields and tolerance/resistance to drought and other adverse conditions. The products can be used equally well by large and sophisticated farmers and seed companies, including those using advanced plant genetic traits, but is also adaptable to smaller growers since the input costs to users will be less than competitive technologies for especially coping with adverse environmental stresses. These tools and advances will assist is overcoming the adverse effects of climate change and provide technologies to maximize scarce water resources.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to formulate the active chemicals to provide user-friendly products for delivery in suitable agricultural systems including seed treatments and augmented fertilizers, and to evaluate prototype products on their advantages in the greenhouse, pilot scale and field trial systems. The field trials will be conducted under conditions of drought stress and will permit measurement of water use efficiency of conventional and advanced drought tolerant corn hybrids in the presence and absence of the new products, and will provide a means to determine the mechanism by which the active chemicals provide improvements in plant performance. This third goal is essential since the chemicals as applied are present only during seed germination, but enhance plant performance throughout the season. The formulations are based on novel systems that will sequester volatile active chemicals but release them only when seeds are germinating. The plant performance characteristics that will be measured include enhanced root development throughout the season, enhanced yield parameters under water limiting conditions, and measure water use efficiency.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to make the solar industry even more sustainable by reducting long term potential environmental impact. With the rapid deployment of solar modules, recycling of end-of-life modules will become a necessity in 15 years. The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) estimates that end-of-life modules will appear in large quantities by the early 2030's and by 2050 they will total 78 million tonnes. Today most end-of-life modules end up in landfills. More importantly, this project will develop a technology to enable a profitable recycling business without any government support, financial and/or legislative. IRENA predicts a new industry worth $15 billion by 2050 from recycling 78 million tonnes of modules. By recovering all the valuable components in modules, our technology has the potential to generate $60 billion in revenue from 78 million tonnes of modules.

    The proposed project develops sustainable recycling processes and related equipment for silicon solar cells and modules. The focus of the project is to recover all the valuable, toxic, and bulky components in cells and modules including solar-grade silicon, silver, lead, copper, tin, aluminum, and glass. It will be demonstrated that the recovered silicon meets the specifications of solar-grade silicon and the recovered metals are over 99% pure. The target for solar-grade silicon recovery is 85% and the target for metal recovery, especially silver, is over 90%. The chemicals for recycling will be carefully chosen so their wastes neutralize each other for a minimal environmental impact.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will investigate novel
    approaches for biopolymer materials that uniquely enable oxygen incorporation into hydrogel
    dressings to improve and accelerate chronic wound healing. The proposed work differs drastically
    from other research programs and commercial efforts to use oxygen in chronic wound healing as
    it is the first to combine oxygen, a moist and clean healing environment, and antimicrobial
    properties into one cost-effective and easy-to-use product. Current commercial oxygen-delivery
    therapies for wound care, e.g., hyperbaric oxygen chambers and topical oxygen devices, are
    intermittent, inconvenient to use, and require access to expensive specialized equipment.
    Successfully introducing oxygenating wound dressings to the market will allow addressing the
    serious and pervasive burden on healthcare facilities and the exorbitant costs associated with
    chronic wound care. In the USA alone, diabetic chronic wounds cause direct healthcare-related
    costs of $1.5 billion and total direct and indirect costs of $20 billion.
    The proposed research incorporates proprietary patent-pending biopolymer materials and
    processing methods to create oxygenating hydrogels that can be made into wound dressings.
    The dressings have the unique potential to provide uniform and tunable oxygenation to heal
    chronic wounds. Dressing embodiments, syntheses, and manufacturing techniques will be
    explored to improve product performance and characteristics, reduce costs, and demonstrate
    commercial feasibility and viability of the production process. Thus, knowledge of biomaterials for
    wound care will be significantly advanced by the proposed research. Prototype wound dressings
    will be characterized and tested based on customer requirements.

    This SBIR Phase I project aims to bring the industrial advanced manufacturing method of abrasive waterjet cutting to individual consumers by fully redesigning the core components of the machine to meet the budgetary needs of a consumer.  This project parallels the current movement of scaling down advance manufacturing techniques such as laser cutting and 3D printing to the growing desktop fabrication market.  Unfortunately, the desktop digital fabrication tools currently available to consumer market are restricted to producing goods in only soft materials like plastics, and wood.  The biggest advantage of abrasive waterjet cutting is its cutting ability in a wide range of materials including plastics, metals, stone, ceramics, glass, and composites.  With this technology finally accessible to a wider audience, everyone from the middle school robotocist, to a creative entrepreneur, to the makerspaces, to artisans, to small businesses will be able to digitally create physical designs in the full gambit of sheet materials that are currently available.


    Current commercial waterjet designs operate in a high pressure region that makes components prohibitively expensive for the consumer market.  To make the technology viable for the masses it must be adapted to a lower pressure space to leverage the necessary component cost savings across the machine.  This starts by creating a new performance model for low-pressure abrasive waterjet cutting through the design and execution of a test matrix that will determine how cutting performance is affected by various waterjet parameters (water pressure, water flow rate, abrasive flow rate, etc.).  With this understanding, the heart of the system, the hydraulic pump, will be adapted and customized from a pump construction that is not currently used for waterjet cutting. Lastly, this effort concludes with a ground-up redesign of the waterjet?s Cutting Head (the assembly that ejects the high velocity mixture of water and abrasive) utilizing low-cost materials, manufacturing processes and a unique geometry optimized for low-pressure cutting.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to address the massive unmet need of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) which affects over 12 million Americans and results in over 65,000 amputations each year. This project will provide the proof of concept for a novel drug delivery technique that will improve the durability of procedures to restore blood flow in PAD patients. The result technology will help reduce the burden of disease while reducing the significant societal and health system costs caused by amputations.

    The proposed project will address the challenge of providing controlled drug dose to arteries of varying diameter and length. Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) patients have atherosclerotic lesions that are long and diffuse, requiring treatment to multiple sites with different vessel diameters and lengths. Existing drug delivery platforms require the use of multiple, expensive devices to treat these patients. This project will demonstrate that a single ultrasound-enhanced drug delivery catheter can provide drug delivery to different artery diameters and lengths, providing significant potential cost and time savings during endovascular procedures. In order apply the desired drug dose to arteries of varying size, real time imaging feedback will be used to adjust the treatment settings to compensate for changes in size. To achieve this goal, ex vivo swine arteries of different sizes will be treated under physiological flow conditions while varying the treatment parameters in order to determine the effect of vessel size on delivered drug dose. From this project, algorithms that can control drug dose to match varying artery diameter will be developed for future in vivo animal model studies.

    for learning and memory. While music has long been recognized for its mnemonic
    properties (e.g., the ABC song, the 50 states song, etc.) and is widely used as
    a memory aid in the context of early childhood learning, music-based educational
    products for the broader K-12 market are rare. Music is unique in its ability
    to engage learners, make learning enjoyable, and transfer information into memory
    more readily. Yet, music is predominantly experienced as an entertainment medium.
    The goal of this research is to position music as a credible pedagogical tool
    by scientifically crafting songs that support the learning of critical academic
    skills and concepts - offering today's learners a relevant, effective and efficient
    medium for boosting learning outcomes. \n\n\nThe technical innovation proposed
    is a scientific framework for mnemonically optimized music and songs. This research
    features two distinctive innovations: 1) isolation and identification of the mnemonic
    drivers of songs, and 2) operationalization of these drivers as parameters for
    the creation of songs optimized for learning. Methods employed include computational
    and statistical modeling, expert input, and behavioral measurement. The potential
    impact of this research addresses a pressing academic need -- how to teach students
    using pedagogy that is relevant, engaging and scientifically sound. If proven
    feasible, this research will fuel creation of a unique musical form designed specifically
    to enhance memory and learning, with application to K-12 learning and beyond.\n\nThis

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase 1 project includes: accelerating the pace of healthcare improvement by making information on high-need/high-cost patients instantly accessible and individually tailored to health care providers; transforming health intervention databases into active and dynamic learning communities about caring for high-need/high-cost patients; reducing the burden on safety net providers to sort and sift through dozens of information sources about delivering care to high-need/high-cost patients. Health Information Networking Tool (HINT) will be a unique combination of customized algorithms that will fill in critical gaps in knowledge, especially around health disparities, the social determinants of health and underserved conditions; boost opportunities for safety net providers to connect with peers to engage in collaborative problem-solving; reduce duplication and repetition of errors and failed interventions across safety net healthcare organizations; increase public recognition for safety net institutions that develop promising interventions; and enable technical advancements in machine learning to suggest models of care for high-need/high-cost patients. The commercial impact for HINT includes: reducing the cost and improving the quality of care delivered to high-need/high cost populations; and creating opportunities for safety net institutions and providers to market their expertise on caring for complex, underserved patients.

    The proposed project was conceived on the belief that ingenious solutions in caring for society's most vulnerable populations occur daily across the safety net health system; that HINT will accelerate innovation by bringing an unprecedented resource to disseminate voluminous and constantly changing healthcare information; that the proposed information network will reduce the fragmentation of information and duplication in errors and failed interventions that currently occur; and finally that unlocking and disseminating innovations and advice from peers - in similar institutions and caring for similar patients - will accelerate successful practices to improve the health of high-need/high-cost patients. HINT proposes to develop unique crawling, clustering, text mining, collaborative filtering, bipartite matching, and ranking algorithms. The team will integrate the six algorithms into a customized social content management system, and address challenges around design and functionality.

    Research Phase 1 project is the possibility of inexpensive clean water generation
    from sea and brackish water.  With rapidly increasing world population, portable
    water will be one of the most important technological challenges of this century.
    There is no unique ?one size fits all? approach to desalination. Many factors
    such as salt concentration, the presence of specific ions, energy cost, pretreatment
    requirements and capital investments are important considerations in selecting
    the desalination technology to be implemented. The carbon nanotube enhanced membrane
    distillation proposed here is a relatively low temperature process where industrial
    waste heat and solar heating can be used for desalination. Small water heaters
    such as the natural gas heaters used in homes can be used to generate high quality
    drinking water along with what is needed for domestic consumption. Another major
    application of this technology is in oil and gas drilling. Hydraulic fracturing
    or fracking is a water-intensive process. A typical frack well uses several million
    gallons of water over its lifetime and generates a highly saline ?produced water?.
    \  With its ability to handle high salt concentrations, the proposed approach
    is a viable alternative for treating this waste.  \n\nThe technical objectives
    in this project are to utilize carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to create breakthrough
    membrane properties for desalination via membrane distillation (MD). In MD, a
    hydrophobic porous membrane separates a hot salt water feed and a cold permeate
    stream.  As the heated brine passes on the membrane and is partially transformed
    to water vapor. The hydrophobicity of the membrane prevents the aqueous solution
    from entering the pores. However, freed from hydrogen bonding the water vapor
    passes through and is condensed on the permeate side of the membrane. The novel
    membranes referred to as carbon nanotube immobilized membranes (CNIM) will be
    developed by immobilizing CNTs into membrane pores where they will serve as molecular
    transporters and sorbents, thus providing additional pathways for water vapor
    transport. The other major advantage of CNIM is that it is less prone to fouling
    than conventional membranes. Key innovations of the proposal include the functionalization
    of CNTs for maximization of water vapor transport while minimizing fouling.  Additional
    objectives include the study of fouling behavior of some commercially important
    water samples such as sea water, power plant effluents and produced water. Finally,
    a process optimization tool will be developed to optimize CNIM-MD design."

    The NSF Center for Nanothread Chemistry pioneers a new form of carbon molecule, formed when arrays of small molecules transform under pressure into arrays of long thread-like molecules in a diamond-like geometry. These remarkable reactions totally reorganize every atom within the starting molecules to produce highly ordered parallel arrays of nanothreads. The team of researchers in the Center for Nanothread Chemistry aims to produce whole new families of nanothreads with diverse chemical compositions, structures, and properties. These materials can currently be made only in very small amounts, and a key goal of the Center is to learn how make larger quantities that will enable further fundamental science and technology impacts. This "flexible diamond" material may be broadly useful in application areas such as high strength composites, energy storage, and catalysis. These new nanomaterials also provide a rich venue for public outreach and the training of a diverse next generation of emerging science professionals.

    The NSF Center for Nanothread Chemistry defines the chemistry generating a new class of organic molecules defined by pervasive covalent bond connectivity in multiple dimensions.  Nanothreads, the first such example, are highly extended one-dimensional molecules with cage-like bonding, akin to the thinnest possible threads of diamond and capped by circumferential hydrogen. Nanothreads are synthesized by an innovative mechanochemical technique in which molecules with multiple unsaturated functions react under stress applied at carefully controlled rates. This strategy overcomes the traditional requirement for topochemical commensuration between the reactant and product and thus allows for many more molecular crystals to react into well-defined structures. The Center team is developing an actionable understanding of the reaction mechanism and enabling the design of new threads with desired arrangements of both interior heteroatoms and exterior functional groups. Post-synthesis modification allows for versatile incorporation of new groups of diverse function and also allows for additional structural elaboration. The unique architecture and properties of nanothreads provide opportunities for commercialization. The interplay of theory, synthesis and characterization provides rich training opportunities for diverse groups of students and researchers.

    Synthetic polymers and plastics make up a $100 billion industry and impact almost every aspect of daily life: from transportation to consumer products to health care.  These materials are made up of long, individual polymer molecules that are connected in a network that forms the bulk material.  In recent years, chemists have learned how to produce remarkable properties in the individual polymer molecules and control the connections between them.  The Center for the Chemistry of Molecularly Optimized Networks (MONET) is developing the knowledge and methods to translate the remarkable properties now available at the molecular level to new properties of polymer networks.  It fuels innovation in formulation and manufacturing, potentially leading to the development of tough, longer-lived materials that reduce waste while being perfectly tailored to their use.  The broader impacts of the Center include interdisciplinary technical training for young scientists across emerging areas of polymer chemistry, and communication and entrepreneurship experiences that position Center trainees for future careers. Finally, the Center partners with community colleges to increase public awareness of the societal impact of science innovation while simultaneously encouraging broader participation in the sciences by communicating the range of career opportunities available to the diverse community college population.

    The scope of MONET comprises quantitative structure-activity relationships that relate polymer network toughness to the toughness of individual network strands, the molecular architecture of the network, and the mechanism and spatial organization of dynamic strand exchange reactions. These objectives are pursued through a unique combination of methods, including precision polymer synthesis, single molecule spectroscopy, coordination chemistry, photochemical switching, and the development and application of new theoretical models and methods. In addition, a prototype database and digital notation for polymer entry (GIGA - the Global Index of Gel Attributes) is being established. The combined gains in fundamental knowledge, technical capability, and informatics strategy address a major chemical knowledge gap. MONET addresses the role of precisely controlled polymer chain length, the molecular mechanical response of a polymer chain, and the mechanisms by which polymer strands exchange in dynamic networks, as well as the influence of molecular scale network defects on each. The knowledge gained informs strategies to bring remarkable properties to polymer networks, by treating them as complex but understandable chemical systems that can be harnessed to produce currently inaccessible collective properties. Key broader impacts of this award include the development of a polymer network database, technical training and professional development for developing scientists, and science communication to diverse audiences.

    of monomers is a current challenge in chemistry. Proteins are natural polymers,
    and are specific sequences of amino acids put together easily and efficiently

    a bio-inspired approach making a sequence of synthetic polymers by re-engineering
    the cell's systems.  In this case, the cell becomes a new translational machine
    that synthesizes new chemical polymers of specific sequence and length. NSF C-GEM
    establishes a new, transformative field of chemistry and fosters innovation at
    the chemistry-biology-materials frontier. The applications of the new materials
    with novel properties range from information storage to anti-counterfeiting and
    drug delivery, from environmental remediation to drug discovery. NSF C-GEM engages
    scientists and non-scientists in a variety of research and educational activities,
    including improved communication to the public. These education and participation
    programs integrate research with training to establish a diverse chemical workforce.
    NSF C-GEM presents a new online platform and data management system, GEM-Net,
    to promote data sharing within and outside the research team. NSF C-GEM is also
    developing an online video game that allows citizen scientists to participate
    in the research process and track results. \n\nThe NSF Center for Genomically
    Encoded Materials, NSF C-GEM, is focused on the challenge of preparing polymers
    whose monomers and dispersity are defined with protein-like control. Sequence-defined
    polymers possess extraordinary potential for information storage, anti-counterfeiting,
    drug delivery, environmental remediation, and even drug discovery, but strategies
    to prepare them are barely in their infancy. NSF C-GEM's approach synthesizes
    sequence-defined chemical polymers by repurposing the E. coli translational apparatus.
    The translation machinery, which normally promotes bond formation between alpha-amino
    acids, now promotes bond-forming reactions between monomers that are the building
    blocks for aramids, polyolefins, polyurethanes, and other polymers. The approach
    demands orthogonal enzymes that acylate orthogonal tRNAs with each monomer, efficiently
    and in vivo; orthogonal ribosomes that accept these tRNAs as substrates and elongate
    the products; genomically-recoded organisms with multiple open codons to enable
    mRNA-templated synthesis of sequence-defined polymers; and high-resolution structural
    data to deepen understanding and inform design. The project develops the multi-disciplinary
    tools and technologies that demonstrate the proof of concept of the approach and
    establish practical methodologies to this aim. NSF C-GEM fosters innovation at
    the chemistry-biology-materials frontier, and engages scientists and non-scientists
    in research and educational activities. A diverse set of education and participation
    programs integrates research with training, establishes a diverse chemical workforce,

    in the field since these processes are central to many chemical applications,
    including the development of new light-harvesting materials (for renewable energy)
    and improved bio-medical imaging techniques. Broader impacts also result from
    the development of new theory tools, graduate student training at the interface
    of theory and experiment, early research opportunities for undergraduates from
    diverse backgrounds, and the use of visualization devices to convey the complexities

    Design of Quantum Processes is focused on developing fully-predictive theoretical
    methods for atomistic quantum mechanical molecular dynamics for the rational theory-aided-design
    of molecules and materials. Strong ties to experimentalists ensure that the methods
    are well validated. Specific collaborative projects include: (1) tailoring transport
    and reactivity of proton defects in complicated environments such as metal organic
    frameworks (MOFs) and interfaces, (2) understanding and manipulating excitation
    energy transport in natural photosynthetic systems, and (3) elucidating and controlling
    the factors governing fluorescence vs. photoisomerization in fluorescent proteins.
    The central theoretical framework is ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD), including
    localized and periodic basis sets, ground and excited-state simulations, and efficient
    dynamics techniques including non-adiabatic and other quantum mechanical effects
    for large spatial and temporal scales. Broader impacts from the research activities

    This project entails the build out of the simulation engine for a touch-based, mobile game designed to intuitively teach the basics of electricity and magnetism to children aged 5+.  The mobile game gives users a picture of what?s happening inside a circuit, and allows them to play with the charges, electric and magnetic forces, voltage, capacitors, transistors, etc.  The use of funds from this NSF SBIR Grant would include the research and development required to build and incorporate this simulator into the game.  This simulator is novel, is customized for educational use, must be extraordinarily fast, and is based on Maxwell?s Equations, the four equations that govern all of electricity and magnetism.  The successful completion of this project will create a new way of teaching electricity and magnetism to children, giving them a visual understanding of the concepts.  The goal is to make science and engineering more attainable subjects to pursue in higher education.  This will lead to an increase in the number of science and engineering graduates in the US, and help to close the international educational achievement gap, which experts agree represents over a $1T overall opportunity loss.  Besides having a profound effect on the US economy, this also benefits the individual.  In 2014, the DOE reported that the median starting income of a STEM (engineering) graduate was $74,000, almost $25,000 more than a non-STEM graduate.

    The proposed real-time, interactive, multi-touch-based simulator would be the first of its kind; no combined two-dimensional field and circuit simulator exists today, particularly for use in an educational game.  This combined simulator only has 16 milliseconds to update its results, whereas a typical two-dimensional field solver could take minutes to hours to solve.  By using a novel simulator architecture and by focusing on speed and conceptual understanding at the necessary precision, the game simulator will be able to achieve the over 100x speed-up required.  The simulator needs to solve Maxwell?s equations and thus calculate and display the electromagnetic physics behavior at 60 frames per second, the rate required for interactive gaming. Several approaches are used to accomplish this.  This simulator is built from the ground up, with a unique choice of variables that prioritizes qualitative understanding over the circuit size and accuracy requirements of an industrial simulator.  The simulator focuses on components and circuits commonly used in teaching.  The simulator also utilizes the combined central/graphics processing hardware available in modern mobile devices.  With this simulator as the core gaming engine, the company is building a game where children as young as five can experiment with and intuitively understand the basics of electricity, magnetism, and circuits.
