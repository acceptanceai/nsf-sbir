### [Start your application in FastLane](https://www.fastlane.nsf.gov/jsp/homepage/proposals.jsp)

NSF is transitioning to a new proposal processing system on Research.gov. You'll need to register in [Research.gov]( https://www.research.gov/research-portal/appmanager/base/desktop?_nfpb=true&_pageLabel=research_home_page) and go to FastLane to upload your proposal. Research.gov is NOT yet accepting SBIR and STTR proposals. 

Before you start your application, take a look at our [FastLane guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/fastlane/) or [download our FastLane guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/files/applicants/Phase_I_Proposal_Preparation_Booklet.pdf) for detailed steps on how to submit your application and [watch our video on how to apply](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCkBRbQxLx0&feature=youtu.be).
