<em>*Each small business can only submit one Project Pitch at a time and up to two Project Pitches per submission window. 
  
**The submission windows for 2020 are:
December 18, 2019 - March 5, 2020
March 6, 2020 - June 4, 2020

A small business with a pending Project Pitch must wait for a response before submitting a second Project Pitch. Any small business that has received an invitation to submit a full proposal, or which has a full proposal under review, must wait for a resolution of the full proposal before submitting a new or revised Project Pitch. A small business submitting a Project Pitch that is not invited to submit a full proposal is permitted to resubmit their Project Pitch (with revisions to address any deficiencies) in a future submission window.</em>
